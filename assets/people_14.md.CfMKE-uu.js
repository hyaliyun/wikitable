However, the History of Song indicated that he was the grandson of Li Sijian's predecessor and older brother Li Sigong.History of Song, vol. 485. In any case, when Li Sijian died in 908, Li Yichang claimed the title of acting military governor of Dingnan. Shortly after, Later Liang's emperor Zhu Quanzhong bestowed on him the title of full military governor. Li Yichang's rule of Dingnan was short. In 909 or 910, his officer Gao Zongyi () mutinied and killed him. The officers and soldiers of Dingnan then killed Gao and supported Li Renfu—a relative of Li Yichang's, one generation higher—as the new ruler of Dingnan. Li Renfu was thereafter made the new military governor by Zhu Quanzhong.

During his career, he played as a small forward and shooting guard. During his college career at the University of Cincinnati, Patterson earned third-team All-American honors and helped lead the Bearcats to Conference USA titles in both of his seasons there. Drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in 1998, Patterson began his career with the Greek team AEK Athens BC before joining the Lakers in his rookie season. Later, he played for the NBA teams Seattle SuperSonics, Portland Trail Blazers, Denver Nuggets, Milwaukee Bucks, and Los Angeles Clippers before ending his career with the Lebanese team Champville SC. Early life Patterson had a troubled family life, both parents and one of his sisters battled drug addiction, and his father spent time in prison. As a youth, he lived mostly with his mother, Charlene Patterson, who died of a heart attack when he was at the University of Cincinnati. After hearing of her death while on a road trip at UAB, he rejected an offer to fly home and spend time with his family, instead staying with his team for the game and scoring 32 points. \\"My mother would have wanted me to play,\\" Patterson later explained. Patterson started off his college basketball career in the small town of Independence, Kansas at the Independence Community College. He later transferred to the University of Cincinnati. Professional career Patterson was a second-round selection of the 1998 NBA Draft (31st pick overall), chosen by the Los Angeles Lakers. Due to the lock-out season of 1998, he started the season in the Greek league playing with AEK Athens BC where he averaged 12.6 points and 3.6 rebounds in 19 games. He later played for the Lakers, the Seattle SuperSonics, the Portland Trail Blazers, the Denver Nuggets, the Milwaukee Bucks, and the Los Angeles Clippers, averaging a career 10.7 points and 4.2 rebounds per game. He nicknamed himself the \\"Kobe Stopper\\" after claiming he could play strong defense against NBA superstar Kobe Bryant. Patterson left the Lakers for Seattle on August 10, 1999 as a free agent. He quickly became known as a solid defensive player and a good shooter, finishing fourth in the league in field goal percentage. He finished his second season in Seattle after starting 74 of 81 games, and third on the team in scoring with 13.6 points per game. After that season, he signed with the Portland Trail Blazers. In his second year in Portland, trouble began to brew for Patterson. He was punched in the face by teammate Zach Randolph during a practice. Randolph intervened in an argument between Patterson and rookie teammate Qyntel Woods. The move cost Randolph $100,000. Often outspoken and erratic, Patterson was temporarily suspended from the Trail Blazers in the 2005–06 season for speaking harshly to coach Nate McMillan and refusing to return to a game, upset about his lack of playing time. Patterson later explained his outburst, saying he was frustrated and it was \\"like the devil hit me and told me to get it out\\". He also demanded that he get at least 25 minutes per game or be traded. In February 2006, Patterson was traded to the Denver Nuggets. In the following off-season, he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for Joe Smith. In Milwaukee, Patterson posted the best numbers of his career with 14.7 points, 2.9 assists and 31.0 minutes per game. He also tied a career-high in rebounds per game with 5.4 and posted a career-best 55% field goal average. On August 29, 2007, Patterson signed a contract with the Los Angeles Clippers.

The road is long and is a suffixed highway of U.S. Route 9 (US 9). NY 9L goes through three municipalities in Warren County: the city of Glens Falls, the town of Queensbury and the town of Lake George. It starts at an intersection with US 9 and NY 32 in Glens Falls and ends at a junction with US 9 and NY 9N in Lake George. NY 9L is a scenic route for people traveling to Lake George as the road provides many views of the lake. The route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York along the path of an old military road originally built during the American Revolution. Route description NY 9L northbound at the hamlet of Oneida Corners in the town of Queensbury NY 9L begins at an intersection with US 9 and NY 32 in downtown Glens Falls. It heads north, intersecting with local roads as it exits the city and enters the town of Queensbury. At the city line, maintenance of the route shifts from the city of Glens Falls to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Just north of the city limits, NY 9L intersects NY 254\\\\. The route continues northward through Queensbury, passing Floyd Bennett Memorial Airport and running parallel to the Washington County line on its way toward and eventually across the Blue Line into Adirondack Park. NY 9L intersects NY 149, an east–west arterial connecting Interstate 87 (I-87) to Vermont, just north of the park limits. The route continues into Brayton, a hamlet situated in northeast Queensbury. At a junction northeast of Glens Falls and north of Brayton, NY 9L meets Pilot Knob Road (County Route 38 or CR 38), a local roadway serving several communities located on the shores of Lake George and along the base of Pilot Knob. NY 9L turns southwest here, roughly paralleling the southern shore of Lake George. A mile west of Brayton, NY 9L intersects with Cleverdale Road, a road serving the small island hamlet of Cleverdale. Just afterward, it passes an open area called Joshua's Rock, with a cluster of buildings. This is Owl's Nest, the home of early realist novelist Edward Eggleston, a designated National Historic Landmark. NY 9L in Glens Falls with a missigned terminus as NY 9L terminates further up After passing the community of Rockhurst, the route intersects Assembly Point Road, another local road serving a minor peninsula and Assembly Point on its tip. Past this point, NY 9L tightly parallels the southern shore of Lake George southwest into the town of Lake George. The route comes to an end at a junction with US 9 and NY 9N south of the village of Lake George at the southwestern extent of the lake. History Modern NY 9L follows the length of the Old Military Road, which was the first road to connect to what is now the town of Queensbury. It was first built in 1755 as the Colonial Army headed north from Albany. The construction of the road helped to increase development in the town. In 1832, the Glens Falls Feeder Canal opened, further improving transportation in Queensbury. Sixteen years later, in 1848, a plank road was built over the old Military Road. NY 9L was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to its current alignment. The bridge carrying NY 9L over Halfway Creek in Queensbury was originally built in 1923. On August 27, 2007, the New York State Department of Transportation announced that the bridge would be replaced at a cost of $1.3 million. Initially, work on the project was to begin in September of that year; however, the start of construction was delayed until April 21, 2008. The new bridge was completed in September.

The process was developed at Bell Labs by Henry Theuerer in 1955 as a modification of a method developed by William Gardner Pfann for germanium. In the vertical configuration molten silicon has sufficient surface tension to keep the charge from separating. Avoidance of the necessity of a containment vessel prevents contamination of the silicon. Float-zone silicon is a high-purity alternative to crystals grown by the Czochralski method. The concentrations of light impurities, such as carbon and oxygen, are extremely low. Another light impurity, nitrogen, helps to control microdefects and also brings about an improvement in mechanical strength of the wafers, and is now being intentionally added during the growth stages. The diameters of float-zone wafers are generally not greater than 200 mm due to the surface tension limitations during growth. A polycrystalline rod of ultrapure electronic-grade silicon is passed through an RF heating coil, which creates a localized molten zone from which the crystal ingot grows. A seed crystal is used at one end in order to start the growth. The whole process is carried out in an evacuated chamber or in an inert gas purge. The molten zone carries the impurities away with it and hence reduces impurity concentration (most impurities are more soluble in the melt than the crystal). Specialized doping techniques like core doping, pill doping, gas doping and neutron transmutation doping are used to incorporate a uniform concentration of impurity. Application Float-zone silicon is typically used for power devices and detector applications. It is highly transparent to terahertz radiation, and is usually used to fabricate optical components, such as lenses and windows, for terahertz applications. It is also used in solar arrays of satellites as it has higher conversion efficiency.

The village is located in the north-west. Inland there are rich taro swamps and fruit groves, and offshore there is good fishing. It has a population of 78, according to the 2016 census. Nassau is governed by the Pukapuka Island Council. The Nassau Island Committee advises the Pukapuka Island Council on matters of Nassau Island. Families live in thatched cottages called kikau. Elliot Smith, in the Cook Islands Companion (Pacific Publishing Company, Albany, California) describes Nassau as \\"a small garden of Eden\\". History Nassau originally belonged to the islanders of nearby Pukapuka and was called Te Nuku-o-Ngalewu which means \\"Land of Ngalewu\\" after the Pukapukan who was put in charge of it. When the two islands fell out with each other, it was renamed \\"Deserted Island\\" (Te Motu Ngaongao), supposedly by the islanders of Manihiki who drifted to the island and found it deserted. The first European to discover the island was Louis Coutance of the ship Adele, who named it \\"Adele island\\" in 1803. Other Europeans to encounter Nassau named it \\"Lydra Island\\" (1827), \\"Ranger Island\\" (pre-1835), and \\"Mitchell Island\\" (1834). In 1835 the captain of an American whaling vessel, John D. Sampson, named it after his vessel, the Nassau. The following year another American whaler named it \\"New-Port island\\". In 1876 an American occupied the island for use as a coconut plantation, employing workers from Pukapuka. From 1916 to 1926 it was leased as a copra plantation by the Samoa Shipping and Trading Company, using workers from Samoa and the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. It continued to be occupied intermittently until it was sold to the Cook Islands government in 1945. In 1951 it was purchased by the Island Council of Pukapuka, which sent annual expeditions to harvest copra. The island became permanently settled around 1970. The island was severely damaged in February 2005 by Cyclone Percy, which destroyed every home and contaminated cropland and water supplies with salt water. Recovery work to the island's infrastructure (Health Clinic, School, Powerhouse, Telecommunications Network and Meeting House) was completed with the help of NZAID and the Government of the Cook Islands in October of that same year, a major feat due to the island's remoteness and infrequent shipping services. The Island now has a completely new school thanks to the NZAID Schools Refurbishment Programme, which is administered by the Cook Islands Investment Corporation. Economy The economy of Nassau originally depended on harvesting copra, with Pukapukan expeditions harvesting a third to a half as much as from the (much larger) Pukapuka. As with Pukapuka, the economy was run communally, with foremen and leaders telling the expedition members what needed to be done, and everyone sharing equally in the proceeds. Because there is no airport, access is limited to inter-island ship from Rarotonga, a voyage of three days or more, or from Pukapuka. The service is infrequent. A harbour was planned in 2007, and in 2010 a small boat passage and mooring wharf had been dynamited out of the reef top, and a second phase was underway in December 2010. The environmental impact was small after the initial blasting White M (2012) Sea turtles in the Cook Islands ~ Volume One: 2009-2012. 360pp. Permalink: http://library.seaturtle.org/6724 A tender for the design of an improved harbour was issued in April 2020. In January 2017 the Taio Shipping vessel MV Moana Nui ran aground on Nassau's reef. The wreck was left in place, and subsequently shifted to block access to Nassau's harbour. A contract to salvage and remove the wreck was issued in November 2019. Nassau was connected to the other islands by telephone in 2004. In 2015 a solar / battery power station was installed, replacing diesel generators and allowing 24-hour electricity.

It is set in the Palladium world (use of the unofficial name \\"Palladia\\" is discouraged by the publisher) some 10,000 years after a great war between the elves and dwarves. First published in July 1983 as The Palladium Role-Playing Game, the Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing Game saw a second edition in April 1996. The two are largely compatible, though the second edition uses a later iteration of Palladium's ruleset to be more compatible with the rest of their Megaverse.  Setting  Race and class = Like many fantasy games, the Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing Game includes many different sentient races as playable characters. In addition to humans and the aforementioned elves and dwarves, there are gnomes (small humanoids who once had a republic), kobolds (wiry, subterranean humanoids who tend to be evil), goblins (small, ugly, stupid humanoids, some of whom have remnants of faerie magic), ogres (large, strong, primitive humans), orcs, trolls, changelings (who are capable of assuming many humanoid forms), and Wolfen. The Wolfen are large, humanoid wolves who have, in the past century, established their own Empire in the extreme north of the continent. Unlike many other fantasy games, there is very little interbreeding between the races. Humans and ogres are related closely enough that offspring are possible, but any children are considered ogres. Wolfen and the related Coyles (who resemble humanoid coyotes) may be able to breed, as one supplement (Adventures in the Northern Wilderness) implies that a non-player character may be half-Coyle/half-Wolfen, but this is not confirmed. There are also a variety of classes available. They are divided up into Men at Arms, Men of Magic, Clergy, and optional Occupational Character Classes (O.C.C.s), as well as Psychic Character Classes (P.C.C.s) for characters whose abilities are primarily psychic in nature). As with most Palladium games, the character classes determine which skills are available to the character, and several grant special powers, as well. = History of the Palladium world = The history of the Palladium world is divided into several \\"ages\\", each corresponding to certain events and differing levels of ambient magical energy. While there are many historians in the Palladium world, the best known historical text is the Tristine Chronicles, of which several different versions exist. Most copies are incomplete, but it is regarded as the authority on Palladium history. Any chronological account of the Palladium world must necessarily begin with the Old Ones.Siembieda, PFRPG Book II: Old Ones, pp. 7–10. Their dominance constituted an Age of Chaos, abounding in magical energy, of which only myth and conflicting interpretations of scant historical evidence (found within the pages of the Tristine Chronicles) remain.Siembieda, PFRPG, p. 277. From this, it cannot be conclusively determined whether the Old Ones themselves were progenitors of the universe entire or just one of numerous factors inscribed as part of the cosmological formula in which every being and plane of existence locates its respective origin. Either way, these entities were ancient beyond all reckoning and possessed of powers that defied comprehension (similar to the Great Old Ones found in the works of H. P. Lovecraft). While their true appearance is unknown, the Old Ones were most often depicted as amorphous mounds of flesh covered with swarming tentacles, unblinking eyes, and gaping maws. Each one laying claim to a particular aspect of evil, they feasted with impunity upon the suffering and attendant dark emotions that resulted from various torments inflicted upon those bound to their oppressive rule. Not only credited with the development of magic in myriad forms (a mere handful survived into the present, but none are fully intact), the Old Ones also gave rise to an untold number of races (only the elf, Titan, and changeling have endured), alongside a legion of slaves from other dimensions. Foremost among these, dragons conspired to bring about the Old Ones' downfall.Siembieda & Wujcik, Dragons & Gods, p. 9. They eventually convinced Ya-Blik (envy) and Al-vil (betrayal) to ensnare Xy (greatest of the Old Ones and representation of power incarnate) within a magical construct of his own design. As a result, Xy was transformed into Thoth, lord of wisdom and distinguished member of the Pantheon of Light, all memories of his prior self irrevocably erased.Siembieda & Wujcik, p. 143. Open revolt was soon underway, and the archaic races, accompanied by Spirits and Gods of Light,Siembieda & Wujcik, p. 76. used this opportunity to rise up against their former masters. At long last, in the wake of all-encompassing destruction and bloodshed, the Old Ones were subdued, placed in an enchanted slumber, and imprisoned in the nether regions of the universe through the combined might of Thoth, the elven mage Lictalon, the dragon Kym-nark-mar, and the angel Lo-kum. Although certain vestiges of the Old Ones' presence and influence managed to escape the ensuing campaign of eradication, the world and its inhabitants were able to establish a new order in their (relative) absence. Following the Age of Chaos was the Age of Light, which was a time of very high ambient magic. It is during this time that humans first appear in history, and religious wars begin as rival gods contend for worshipers. This period is known to be very long, but essentially indeterminate in length and time. Sometime after the Age of Light was the Time of a Thousand Magicks. While magic was not substantially more powerful than during the Age of Light, it was at this point that magic reached a point of great diversity. This led to elves gaining great influence across the middle of the continent, and dwarves developing rune magic: the art of trapping souls in indestructible objects. The elf and dwarf empires grew in strength, and cooperated closely for centuries, but the dwarves grew resentful of elven high-handedness, and the elves suspected the dwarves of scheming. This resulted in the Elf–Dwarf War, which nearly destroyed the two empires, as each tried to outdo the other in magical atrocities. It culminated with the destruction of the Golden City of Baalgor, and the creation of the Baalgor Wastelands. Following the war, dwarves forever foreswore magic, and both cooperated to purge the world of \\"evil\\" magic, sparing only a few types which they judged worthy of remaining in a Millennium of Purification. Many other traditions of magic went underground or to other worlds, however, or survived in a few members who have since spread. Since that time, ten thousand years ago, humans have become the dominant race on the planet, controlling four of the major kingdoms or confederacies. In the past fifty years, the Wolfen of the Northern Wilderness have become highly organized, developing a society which now clashes regularly with humans in the Eastern Territories. = Geography and politics = The game takes place on a single continent and several nearby islands. The extreme south of the world is tropical, having a jungle on the western coast, while the extreme northern portions of the country are subarctic forest. Given the size of the continent (approximately 2,500 miles north to south), this makes the planet slightly larger than Mars. The continent represents only part of the world, but it was revealed in the first edition supplement Island at the Edge of the World that the game setting is surrounded by a large, impenetrable black wall for unknown reasons. Land of the Damned Two: Eternal Torment also revealed that there are other lands on the Palladium world that were not involved in the war against the Old Ones. Politically, there are several nations and several alliances amongst races. Humans are allied to both elves and dwarves, though those two races still maintain personal hostility because of the Elf–Dwarf War. Humans are in charge of the Western Empire, a decadent empire which lies between the two inland seas of the continent. The Eastern Territories are also called the \\"Domain of Man\\" and have a large population of humans as well as elves and some dwarves. Immediately north of the Eastern Territories is the Wolfen Empire which is open to all races, though it is dominated by Wolfen and is somewhat suspicious of humans due to long-running conflicts with the Eastern Territories over some disputed land. To the south of the Eastern Territories is the predominantly human kingdom of Timiro. In between the Western Empire and the Eastern Territories lies the Old Kingdom, the former center of elven civilization, now populated by large numbers of orcs, ogres, and similar monsters. South of the Old Kingdom is the giant-run kingdom of Mount Nimro, which is centered around two volcanoes. West of Mount Nimro is the Land of the South Winds, of which only sketchy information has been presented, and the Baalgor Wastelands, created at the very end of the Elf–Dwarf War as the result of a catastrophic dwarven attack which destroyed the elven capital. Southwest of the Baalgor Wastelands and west of the Land of the South Winds are the Yin-Sloth Jungles. = Magic and psionics = The Palladium world is a magical world, with several different kinds of magic practiced, as well as psychic powers. In the past, many more types of magic were practiced, but immediately after the Elf-Dwarf War, a Millennium of Purification saw the end of many types of \\"questionable\\" magic. The major remaining forms of magic are Wizardry (spell-casting), Diabolism (magical writing, used for wards and empowerment), Summoning (using magic circles to protect, to bind demons and other creatures, or activate various powers), Alchemy (creating magic items), Elementalism (in which a person, known as a Warlock, uses a special bond with one or two classical elements to cast spells and summon elementals), Witchcraft (in which a person signs a pact with a demon, trading souls, servitude, or other favors in exchange for power), Priestly Magic, and Druidism (nature magic). Psychic powers are also common, though several races lack any psionic potential at all. Those characters whose race does have psychic potential have a chance to possess a few powers, regardless of their O.C.C. All of these operate on Palladium's standard system of magic being powered by Potential Psychic Energy (P.P.E.), and psychic powers being fueled by Inner Strength Points (I.S.P.), both working like magic points.

However, he admired the \\"Attractive combat and skill systems. First-class magical character classes — complete with magical circles, mystic symbols, and elemental magics — offer simple but comprehensive fantasy magic. Nice treatment of alignments and deities. Contains an outline of a campaign world and a brief but imaginative introductory scenario.\\" However, he concluded that since it was only a book, \\"At a price of $20 for a paperback, only a fair value.\\" In the May-June 1985 edition of Space Gamer (Issue No. 74), Jerry Epperson was more ambivalent, saying \\"The Palladium Role-Playing Game is a game that aspired to greatness but fell just a little short of the mark. With the advent of RuneQuest, The Fantasy Trip, and Lands of Adventure, Palladium is just a little out of step. GMs who are looking to add spice to their D&D; games, or who really don't demand a great deal of realism from game mechanics, should by all means pick up Palladium. But if you're searching for the ultimate in 'realism' and innovative design . . . keep looking.\\" In the November 1987 edition of Dragon (Issue 127), Ken Rolston reviewed the regional adventure guide Adventures on the High Seas, published in 1987, and found much to his liking: \\"The Palladium fantasy campaign world is full of magic and monsters, just like FRP campaigns should be, and this pack contains a little bit of everything, from orcs and lost temples to pirates and crazed cult assassins... What it lacks in organization and sophistication it more than makes up for in enthusiasm and imagination.\\" Ten years later, in the December 1997 edition of Dragon (Issue 242), Rick Swan reviewed the second edition of Adventures on the High Seas, published in 1996, and called it \\"another winner.\\" He rated the book 5 out of 6, saying, \\"The seafaring stuff [is] the best of its kind I’ve ever seen.\\" Andy Butcher reviewed Palladium Fantasy RPG 2nd Edition for Arcane magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall. Butcher comments that \\"if you haven't got any of the other [Palladium] games and your campaign is based firmly in the Palladium World, then there's a great deal of useful stuff here.\\" In a 1996 reader poll conducted by Arcane magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, The Palladium Fantasy RPG was ranked 26th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: \\"Well, the rules are almost identical to those in Palladium's Rifts roleplaying system, and as such it's well suited to existing players of that game, who will have little to learn. Even newcomers should have little difficulty with The Palladium Fantasy RPG, though. The rules lie somewhere between AD&D; and Rolemaster in complexity, and combine character classes with a simple skills system. A good alternative to the better known Fantasy RPGs.\\"  Notes  References    External links  *Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing Game official discussion board at Palladium Books Forums of the Megaverse *Palladium Fantasy at RPG Geek Database *Palladium Fantasy at RPGnet Game Index Category:Megaverse (Palladium Books) Category:Fantasy role-playing games Category:Palladium Fantasy Role- Playing Game Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1983 ","title":"Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing Game"},{"id":"2468490","title":"Treaty of La Pointe"},{"id":"2468495","text":"Orson is a village in Preston Township, Wayne County, Pennsylvania, in the Lake Region of the Poconos. It was once an important depot of the Scranton Division of the New York, Ontario & Western (O&W;) Railway, but today, when it is known outside of its immediate vicinity, it is largely for being the site of the intersection of two state roads, Belmont Turnpike (partially concurrent with Pennsylvania Route 670, or PA-670) and Crosstown Highway (entirely concurrent with PA-370), or as the location of Independent Lake Camp (ILC), since ILC's reputation and commercial reach, like those of most rural American summer camps, extend beyond the community in which the camp is physically located. Municipal status and boundaries One of Orson's PennDOT signs, located on Crosstown Highway to the east of the intersection with Belmont Turnpike. Two Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) signs on Crosstown Highway identify the community as the \\"Village of Orson.\\" In Pennsylvania, a village is an unincorporated community within a township, but PennDOT identifies most villages with roadside signs, a fact that might reasonably lead those unfamiliar with this practice to believe that these communities are incorporated municipalities administered separately from the townships in which they are located. Since Pennsylvania's villages, including Orson, are, in fact, not municipalities in their own right, they do not have official boundaries, and the United States Census Bureau does not collect statistics for them (unless, unlike Orson, they are census-designated places). In spite of this, because of strong local consensus, as well as the fact that many features are named for the villages they are associated with, it is almost always possible to consistently determine whether a particular feature is in one village or another. Natural features PA-171, facing northeast. The NEP cell tower and a few buildings that are part of ILC can also be seen in the distance, center-right. Mount Ararat, as seen from approximately the same spot, but facing southeast. Notable natural features located in Orson include Mount Ararat (partially in Belmont Corners, Pennsylvania, and sometimes called Ararat Mountain, Ararat Peak, Ararat Summit, or simply \\"Ararat\\"), Independent Lake (partially in Poyntelle, Pennsylvania, and formerly known as Independence Pond or Independent Pond, and sometimes known today as Lake Independence or Lake Independent), Mud Pond (partially in East Ararat, Pennsylvania), Orson Pond, and Sugarloaf Mountain (formerly called Sugar Loaf Peak or Sugar-loaf Mountain). In addition, some of the small, unnamed streams that are the source of the West Branch of the Lackawaxen River begin in the southern part of the village (the rest are in Poyntelle). Independent Lake is one of the four sources of the East Branch of the Lackawanna River (the other three being Bone Pond, or Summit Lake,Water Supply Commission of Pennsylvania. p. 29. and Lake Lorain, or Five Mile Pond,Water Supply Commission of Pennsylvania. p. 65. in Poyntelle; and Dunn Pond, or Dunns Lake,Water Supply Commission of Pennsylvania. p. 57. in East Ararat). It is fed by natural springs on the lake bottom. Orson Pond, a reservoir once used for ice harvesting and other economic activities,Water Supply Commission of Pennsylvania. p. 136. was originally a much smaller body of water, but was expanded significantly when the Orson Pond Dam, or Orson Dam, (which is of the rock-fill variety) was built. The pond drains into the Lackawanna. Roads and intersections As has been noted above, Orson is centered around the intersection of Belmont Turnpike and Crosstown Highway. This intersection is the northern terminus of both Belmont and PA-670 (which are concurrent there), and the paved road that runs north from the junction is called Oxbow Road (at least one source says \\"Orson\\" Road). Oxbow is designated PA-4035, and is part of neither PA-670 nor Belmont. Township roads in Orson include Blewett Road (Township Road 678, or T678), which connects to Crosstown; Clark Road (T579), which connects to Crosstown and Oxbow; Doyle Road (T686), which connects to Crosstown and Clark; Hines Road (T692), which connects to just Clark; Mud Pond Road (T565), which connects to just Crosstown; and Paluch Road (T567), which connects to Belmont. In Pennsylvania, township roads are numbered by county (i.e., a single number may be assigned to multiple roads as long as each road is in a different county), but are maintained by township (i.e., the township is entirely responsible for their upkeep). Like many township roads in the state, Blewett, Clark, Doyle, Hines, Mud Pond, and Paluch are all unpaved. There is also one officially-named (i.e., its name may be used in addresses) private road in the village, Black Bear Lane, which connects to Crosstown and is also unpaved. History The community known today as Orson was founded by Merritt Hine (at least one source says \\"Merrill\\" HineGoodrich. p. 244.) of Woodbridge, Connecticut, in 1840 (one source says he was from Massachusetts and that he founded the village in 1831). He was the son of David Hine, who relocated to Pennsylvania sometime after his son was established there. Like many of the early settlers of Wayne County, the elder Hine was a veteran of the Revolutionary War, having served in the Continental Army. In its early days, the settlement was known as Hine's Corners, and was situated around what is now the intersection of Clark and Oxbow Roads. \\"Hines Corners\\" (note that the apostrophe is dropped) is still the accepted name for the intersection of Clark and Oxbow, and it is labeled as such on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle map which includes Orson (the quadrangle also being called \\"Orson\\"). Hine's Corners quickly grew to a reasonable size and appears in F. W. Beers' 1872 Atlas of Wayne County. The population subsisted in large part on agriculture, dairying, and ice harvesting, the last of which was facilitated by the large number of lakes in the area. The Hine's Corners United Methodist Congregation was formed in 1849 after the conversion of Catharine Hine (née Belcher), wife of Merritt Hine, and the Hine's Corners Methodist Episcopal (ME) Church (later the Orson ME Church) was completed in July 1876. Hine's Corners Post Office opened on September 8, 1873. On December 25, 1878, Orson C. Chamberlain, a great-grandchild of Catharine and Merritt Hine, died of diphtheria in an epidemic that affected many people in the area. The community came to be known as Orson Corners (virtually always shortened to Orson) in his honor, and the post office was accordingly renamed \\"Orson Post Office\\" on September 19, 1896. When the O&W; Railway expanded its service to Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 1890, it created several depots in rural Wayne County, one of which was located in Orson. The station was listed on maps and timetables as both \\"Orson\\" and as \\"Belmont,\\" the latter being a variant name for Belmont Corners. The Orson/Belmont depot, which had the call letters \\"BM,\\" was located a few yards south of what is now the intersection of Belmont Turnpike and Crosstown Highway, and its construction caused the community to move slightly southwards in order to take advantage of the economic opportunities brought by the new railroad. The rail traffic brought great prosperity to Orson, and at the height of the railroad's popularity, the village boasted two creameries, two ice houses, a grain mill, a sawmill, and several hotels and stores, created in large part to serve the influx of people brought to and through Orson by the O&W.; =Summer camp industry= thumbleftalt=Chart listing all summer camps which have been historically located on Independent Lake (in either Orson or Poyntelle), with color coding.A visual representation of the summer camps situated on the banks of Independent Lake, in either Orson (western bank) or Poyntelle (eastern bank). Numbers with the same name indicate a change in ownership/management. The depot building burned down on March 24, 1933. The O&W; did not rebuild it (although it continued to use the stop for freight operations) and got permission on June 5, 1939, from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to convert it to an unstaffed station. It was finally abandoned in 1957 after the O&W; went bankrupt, and this event largely marked the end of Orson's notability outside of its contiguity. Many of the village's business establishments closed soon after the railroad did, with the notable exception of the summer camps that would gradually come to replace the railroad as Orson's main source of supra-regional prominence. The first of these was Camp Nehantic, a Jewish girls’ camp that was founded in 1919 by Harry Davidson and his wife, and that had originally been located on Crescent Beach in Niantic, Connecticut. Between 1925 and 1926, Nehantic moved to the western bank of Independent Lake, in Orson, and soon became an important part of the community's economy. In 1931, the camp was bought by J.A. Wells, and then, between 1936 and 1937, it closed and was replaced in 1937 by Camps Carmelia and Keeyumah, twin Jewish camps for girls and boys, respectively. These two had both opened around 1928 on the banks of Lake Champlain in Milton, Vermont (at least one source says they were located in Oneonta, New York, and refers to the boys' camp as \\"Keeyuma\\"). The two camps shared facilities and operated in concert with each other until 1949, when they were consolidated into one coeducational, Jewish camp that seems to have been administratively distinct from them, but was nevertheless also called Camp Keeyumah. This Keeyumah was open until 1974. Meanwhile, the eastern bank of the lake, in Poyntelle, had long been occupied by Camp Echo Lark. Echo Lark had been founded in 1923 in Hyde Park, New York, and had moved to Poyntelle in 1927.Sargent (1935). p. 436. Originally a Jewish girl's camp under the direction of Augusta Nomburg, Echo Lark went coed when it was taken over by Ace Weinstein in either 1938 or 1940 (two additional sources say 1932 and 1935, respectively, but they cannot be independently verified). Echo Lark was subsequently owned by Ben Applebaum from 1968Campecholark (25 August 2010). 0:17. (or 1969Campecholark (2011). 3:15.) until 1974, when he sold itCampecholark (2011). 6:25. to Robert and Zelda Gould. Echo Lark survived until 1991, when a camp called New England Experience supplanted it. New England Experience had relocated from Avon, Connecticut, where it had been founded in 1983. It had originally been associated with French Woods Festival of the Performing Arts, a still- operating performing arts-oriented camp in Hancock, New York. In 1981, after the western bank had been vacant for seven years, a new camp, called Camp Westmont, took over the property.American Camping Association (1991). 162. This situation continued until 1992, when Westmont and New England Experience switched places, with Westmont moving to the lake's eastern bank in Poyntelle, where it remains today, and New England Experience relocating to the western bank in Orson. In addition, New England Experience changed its name to NE2 at Independent Lake, and became alternatively known as \\"Independent Lake Camp.\\" By 1995, the latter moniker had fully replaced the former, a phenomenon which had the effect of obscuring the link between ILC and the original Connecticut camp for those who began attending or working there after the name change. On September 13, 2001, the owners of ILC purchased land on a nameless hill to the south of the lakefront. This new area was dubbed \\"Elkview,\\" after Elk Hill (often called Elk MountainWhite & Dolph. 137.) in Tirzah, Pennsylvania, which is visible from the top of the nameless hill, while the original land that had been part of the previous camps became known as \\"Lakeside,\\" after Independent Lake. Places of interest The plaque commemorating the village's founding, located at Hines Corners. Orson Cemetery, which was originally called Hine's Corners Cemetery, is a small family cemetery which is no longer an active burial site. It contains the graves of Catharine, David, and Merritt Hine, Orson C. Chamberlain, and other early Hine's Corners/Orson residents, and is on Clark Road across from Independent Lake. Orson Field Airport, a privately owned and operated airstrip, connects to Hines Road in northern Orson. The building that once housed the aforementioned Orson ME Church, which was officially abandoned on July 1, 2013, is located on Oxbow Road between Clark and Crosstown Highway. There are also three cell towers in the village, the first of which is owned by the North-Eastern Pennsylvania Telephone Company (NEP) and is located on the above-mentioned nameless hill in Elkview. The other two are owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP), respectively, and are both located on Mount Ararat, the former (which is also called Mount Ararat) a few feet southwest of the latter (which is called Waldon Remote). They are accessible by a small, nameless path that connects to Belmont Turnpike near the border of Preston and Mount Pleasant Townships. In addition, the PA O&W; Trail, maintained by the Rails- to-Trails Conservancy, runs through Orson. At Hines Corners, there is a plaque commemorating the founding of the original Village of Hine's Corners by David and Merritt Hine. The plaque was placed there on August 9, 1925, by descendants of the Hine family. It states that the Hines founded the community in 1811, while historical sources (all of which were published before the erection of the plaque) put the founding date at either 1831 or 1840 instead. However, these sources also offer a possible solution: both note that the younger Hine came from Connecticut (or Massachusetts) in 1811 (or 1810), and say that he came first to the nearby Village of Ararat in Ararat Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. It is possible that family lore may have diverged from the truth in the intervening century between Hine's Corners' founding and the plaque's erection. =Orson Post Office and ZIP code situation= The previously mentioned Orson Post Office is in the basement of a home on Belmont Turnpike, just under a mile south of the intersection of Belmont and Crosstown. While it is technically still open, it was placed under emergency suspension on May 9, 2008, and no longer provides postal services. The last entity to use Orson's ZIP code, 18449 (which retains legal status because the post office has not been officially discontinued), in its mailing address was Orson Corners Veterinary Clinic, and all mailing addresses within the village now employ 18439, 18465, or 18470 (the ZIP codes of Lakewood, Pennsylvania; Thompson, Pennsylvania; and Union Dale, Pennsylvania, respectively). While discrepancies between physical and mailing addresses are not uncommon in sparsely-populated rural areas, where the number of locally recognized communities routinely exceeds the number of post offices, in most cases a community with a discontinued or suspended post office tends to be absorbed into a single ZIP code (e.g., Panther, Pennsylvania). Since Orson now straddles three ZIP codes, some people without a relatively high degree of familiarity with the area may mistakenly think that a given feature is actually in one of the three communities those ZIP codes primarily represent. This is especially problematic given that two of those communities, Union Dale and Thompson, are incorporated municipalities (and therefore have clearly defined borders), and are not even in the same county as Orson. However, at least in theory, it would still be appropriate to give the physical addresses of places in Orson using \\"Orson, PA 18449,\\" regardless of what ZIP code these places use in their mailing addresses. Education Hine's Corners/Orson has been home to four public schools over the course of its history. The first and second existed during the Hine's Corners-era, and were both situated along what is today Oxbow Road near what is now Clark Road, the first on the southern side of Clark and the second on its northern side. They existed from 1860 to and from to , respectively, and both were referred to simply as \\"Hine's Corners School.\\" The third and fourth schools were built after the community became known as Orson, and were located on Oxbow between Clark and Crosstown Highway, adjacent to Orson ME Church, the third pushed back significantly from the road. The former of these two operated from to 1924, and the latter was open from 1924 to 1956. Both were generally referred to as \\"Orson School,\\" although at least one source refers to the fourth school as \\"Simpson School.\\" The building that once housed this last school is still standing and has been converted into a private residence. Today, Orson, along with the rest of Preston Township, is in Region I of the Wayne Highlands School District. The closest school to Orson is the Preston Area School in Lakewood, which serves pupils grades K-8. For high school-aged students, Honesdale High School serves the entire district. While there are also a few private and parochial schools in Wayne County, none of them are in Preston Township. Economy Modern Orson is home to three year-round businesses. The aforementioned Orson Corners Veterinary Clinic is located on the south side of Crosstown Highway, and mainly serves local dairy farms in the area. Dr. James Watson (not to be confused with James Watson, biologist) of the clinic once maintained a heliport, called Watson Airport, behind the clinic building, which he used to facilitate veterinary visits in the area. The Orson Country Inn, which is often referred to as the Orson Inn or simply \\"the O,\\" is a popular congregation spot for Orson residents and visitors alike, and functions as an inn equipped with a bar and a private event space. It is located on the west side of Belmont Turnpike. Orson's Best Garden Center And Farmstand is also on the west side of Belmont, several yards south of the Orson Inn, and sells produce, house and garden plants, and various animal products. Orson is also the location of one seasonal business, the previously described ILC, which operates annually from the second-to-last Sunday in June until the last Sunday in August.

The theory addresses the need to educate people for the knowledge age society, in which knowledge and innovation are pervasive.(Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2003) Knowledge building may be defined simply as \\"the creation, testing, and improvement of conceptual artifacts. It is not confined to education but applies to creative knowledge work of all kinds\\".(Bereiter & Scardamalia, 2003, p. 13)  Overview  Scardamalia & Bereiter distinguish between knowledge building and learning. They see learning as an internal, (almost) unobservable process that results in changes of beliefs, attitudes, or skills. By contrast, KB is seen as creating or modifying public knowledge. KB produces knowledge that lives ‘in the world’, and is available to be worked on and used by other people. A good way to understand the difference between learning and knowledge building is by considering mathematics and scientific contents as examples of public knowledge. Furthermore, Bereiter in his book on Education and Mind (2002) based his observation of the educational value of KB on Karl Popper's ontological analysis of our existence as made up of three interacting worlds: World 1 (the physical), World 2 (the subjective) and World 3 (the locus of cultural products). Thus, learning takes place in World 2, while knowledge is built in World 3.(Popper, 1996) Knowledge building refers to the process of creating new cognitive artifacts as a result of common goals, group discussions, and synthesis of ideas. These pursuits should advance the current understanding of individuals within a group, at a level beyond their initial knowledge level, and should be directed towards advancing the understanding of what is known about that topic or idea. The theory \\"encompasses the foundational learning, subskills, and socio-cognitive dynamics pursued in other approaches, along with the additional benefit of movement along the trajectory to mature education\\".(Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2003, p. 5) Knowledge building can be considered as deep constructivism (Scardamalia, 2002) that involves making a collective inquiry into a specific topic, and coming to a deeper understanding through interactive questioning, dialogue, and continuing improvement of ideas. Ideas are thus the medium of operation in KB environments. The teacher becomes a guide, rather than a director, and allows students to take over a significant portion of the responsibility for their own learning, including planning, execution, and evaluation. One of the hallmarks of KB is a sense of we superseding the sense of I, a feeling that the group is operating collectively, and not just as an assemblage of individuals. Discussion software can enable such an environment, one being Knowledge Forum, which supports many of the prerequisite processes of KB. Bereiter and colleagues (1997, p. 12) state that Knowledge building projects focus on understanding rather than on accomplishing tasks, and on collaboration rather than on controversy. Setting children on a KB trajectory is a promising foundation for education in the knowledge age.  Principles of Knowledge building  Scardamalia (2002) identifies twelve principles of KB as follows: · Real ideas and genuine real problems. In the classroom students should concerned about understanding the real-world problems. · Ideas Improvable. Students' ideas are regarded as improvable objects · A variety of ideas. In the classroom, a variety of ideas raised by students is necessary. · Rise above. Through continuous improvement in ideas and understanding, students create high-level concepts. · Epistemic agency. Students themselves find their way to advance. · Community knowledge, collective responsibility. The contribution of students in improving their collective knowledge in the classroom is the primary goal of the Knowledge building class. · The democratization of knowledge. All people are invited to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the classroom. · Symmetric advancement of knowledge. The goal for Knowledge building communities is to have people and organizations working actively to ensure the mutual progress of their knowledge. · The pervasive building of knowledge. Students contribute to the collective building of knowledge. · Constructive use of authoritative sources. All participants, including teachers, stand the call as a natural approach to support their understanding. · The conversation of building knowledge. Students are engaged in conversation to share and improve the advancement of knowledge in the classroom. · Parallel, enabled, and transformable evaluation. Students gain a global view of their understanding, then decide how to approach their grades. They create and participate in evaluations in a variety of ways  See also  * Educational psychology * Progressive Inquiry * Knowledge environment * Knowledge Forum * Fle3 - Future Learning Environment * Knowledge building communities * Constructionist learning * Postmodernism * Body-mind problem * Idea Thread Mapper  References  Further reading  * Bereiter, C.

The town is situated between the foothills of the Montgrí Massif and the Mediterranean Sea, and is part of the municipality of Torroella de Montgrí, in the Baix Empordà county, Girona province, autonomous community of Catalonia. L'Estartit stretches North-South from Cala Montgó, at the southern tip of the Bay of Roses (Badía de Roses) to the Ter River estuary in the Bay of Pals (Badía de Pals). East-West it extends three kilometres inland from the shoreline, and includes the hills of Roca Maura and Torre Moratxa. A kilometre off shore lies the Illes Medes archipelago, composed of various uninhabited islands. The area has been protected by Natural Park status and is home to many different species of flora and fauna, both above and below the waterline. Initially a fishing village, the advent of tourism in the Costa Brava from the 1960s onwards brought a large influx of visitors to the town during the summer months. The community grew exponentially for the next two decades, initially with houses and villas built up the hills that surround the harbour, and later with hotels, apartment blocks and campsites extending along the beach and the flood plain of the Ter estuary. The tourist industry also led to a large immigrant population (mostly from other parts of Spain), needed to serve the ever-growing number of visitors. Tourists visiting L'Estartit originate mainly from France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands, whilst the majority of the labour force hails from the south of Spain, especially Andalusia. Like many other tourist resorts around the world, massification and uncontrolled growth led the town to lose the charm that had made it popular in the first place. Tourism has been dwindling since the 1990s. However the underwater beauty of the Illes Medes, the large and well-equipped sports marina and the abundance of nearby golf courses keep divers, sailors and golfers coming back year after year and has seen a revival in the area's fortunes. There was a LORAN-C transmitter of the Mediterranean Sea Chain in L'Estartit, which has now been demolished.

The seaport of Temryuk is situated from the town itself. Population: 26,600 (1975). History Situated in the proximity of the site of ancient Tmutarakan, Temryuk was vied by various powers as a vantage point commanding the mouth of the Kuban River. The first recorded settlement on the site was Tumnev, a Tatar fortress, which passed to the Genoese merchants in the 14th century. It was known as Copa until occupied by the Crimean Khanate in 1483. The Russians, allied with a local potentate, Temryuk of Kabardia, captured Tumnev and built a fortress of New Temryuk there. The Crimean Tatars retook the fort in 1570; it was known as Adis for a century to come. In the 18th century, the site was settled by the Cossacks, whose stanitsa was incorporated as the town of Temryuk in 1860. Tens of thousands of years ago, the Azov Sea was much larger and covered the delta of the Kuban River. Deposition of silt by the Kuban gradually pushed out the sea and shaped the delta with numerous limans and shallow estuaries. Frequent eruptions of the mud volcanoes contributed to this deposition process. There are about 25 mud volcanoes in the area and some are still active.[5][6] The Germans took the Kuban Gorge (General Konrad Pass) and the town of Temyruk, connected to the nae of Temujin, in 1942–43. Kropotkin's focus on local production led to his view that a country should strive for self-sufficiency: manufacture its own goods and grow its own food, lessening dependence on imports. To these ends, he advocated irrigation and greenhouses to boost local food production ability.[61]Tens of thousands of years ago, the Azov Sea was much larger and covered the delta of the Kuban River.

He is one of the founding members of the Blue Man Group, as well as co-founder of Blue School. He has won numerous awards as a writer and performer, including a Grammy nomination, and is a frequent guest speaker on the topic of creativity.  Early life  Wink was influenced early in his education when he attended an experimental elementary school located in the Teachers College at Columbia University. The school focused on creative writing and scientific exploration, rather than a rigid adherence to a standard curriculum. This helped shape what would become Wink's lifelong commitment to creativity, following his passion for artistic exploration. After attending high school at the Fieldston School, Wink majored in American Studies at Wesleyan University with a concentration in art history and pop culture. It was at Wesleyan that Wink started drumming. After graduation, Wink played drums by night with post-punk bands. A full-time job as a cater-waiter at Glorious Foods followed, where he worked with longtime friend Phil Stanton.  Funeral for the eighties  Together with Wink's childhood friend Matt Goldman, Stanton and Wink began performing as Blue Men in small downtown venues such as LaMaMa E.T.C. and P.S. 122. In 1988, Wink and his friends planned the very first Blue Man Group event, \\"Funeral for the '80s,\\" a procession through Central Park. There they set fire to what they considered the worst aspects of the decade, including a Rambo doll and a piece of the Berlin Wall. The event captured the interest of MTV, thrusting the character into the public consciousness.  Blue Man Group  In 1991, Wink, Stanton, and Goldman opened Blue Man Group: Tubes at the Astor Place Theater. They expected the early shows would appeal only to the downtown scene, but soon they were adding performances and playing to sold-out crowds. Wink performed in over 1,200 shows without an understudy before they started to expand, training other performers in the qualities, humanity, and talents of the Blue Man. It was at this point that Wink and his co-founders started to consider other venues for their character. The company's careful expansion, starting in 1995 in Boston at the Charles Playhouse and 1997 in Chicago's Briar Street Theatre, now extends internationally, with additional productions in Las Vegas, Orlando, and Berlin, as well as National and International Tours. Blue Man Group has been featured on television programs such as Arrested Development, The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon, The Simpsons, I Can Do That, Best Time Ever with Neil Patrick Harris, Family Guy, America's Got Talent, Ellen, and a record nineteen appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.  The Blue School  In 2009, Wink, Stanton, and Goldman along with their wives Jen Wink Hays, Jennifer Stanton, and Renee Rolleri founded the Blue School. The Blue School is a progressive independent school in New York City's South Street Seaport. The school began as an informal playgroup and has since expanded to include programs for children from the pre-primary through middle school levels.Goldman, Matt. \\"Letter From Our Founder\\", Blue School.

Early life Adolf Bertram was born in Hildesheim, Royal Prussian Province of Hanover (now Lower Saxony), Germany. He studied theology at the University of Munich, the University of Innsbruck, and the University of Würzburg, where he obtained a doctorate in theology, and at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he earned a doctorate in canon law in 1884. He was ordained a Roman Catholic diocesan priest in 1881. On 26 April 1906 he was elected bishop of Hildesheim, an election that received papal confirmation on 12 June 1906. Eight years later, on 8 September 1914, the Pope confirmed his election by the cathedral chapter of Breslau as bishop of that see, and he took possession of it on 28 October. Since 1824 the title Prince-Bishop of Breslau was a merely honorific title granted to the incumbents of the see, without a prince- bishopric of secular rule wielded by the incumbent, but granting a seat in the Prussian House of Lords and in the Austrian House of Lords. This, however, was abolished when Austria and Prussia became republican after 1918. Bertram continued to use the title of prince-bishop also thereafter until he was ranked Archbishop of Breslau on 13 August 1930. Cardinal On 4 December 1916 Bertram was created a cardinal but only in pectore for fear of provoking a negative reaction against the Church on the part of the Allies, especially from the Italian side. After hostilities ceased, his appointment was published on 5 December 1919, and he was assigned the titular church of Sant'Agnese fuori le mura on 18 December 1919. From 1919 to his death, he was also Chairman of the Fulda Conference of Catholic Bishops, the highest representative of the Catholic Church in Germany. =Silesian uprisings= Cardinal Bertram's coat of arms as Prince-Bishop.Throughout the Polish Uprisings against Germany in parts of Upper Silesia, he underlined his pro- German attitude, in line with his previous declaration of being a \\"German bishop\\" attached to the German state, which generated controversy and criticism from Poles. Throughout the upheaval, he tried to influence the Vatican on behalf of Germany.Stanisław Sierpowski. Watykan wobec polsko- niemieckich plebiscytów 1919–1921 (1988) In turn, he was called a \\"German chauvinist\\" and accused of being \\"anti-Polish\\", as he removed Polish priests and replaced them with Germans in Upper Silesia during the events. He forbade Polish priests from taking part in Polish cultural and political activities but allowed German ones to participate in political agitation. Bertram questioned the decree of Pope Benedict XV that ordered him to refrain from visiting Upper Silesia during the Upper Silesia plebiscite, calling it \\"the result of Polish intrigue\\" by August Hlond, a personal friend of Benedict XV. Order of 21 November 1920 On 21 November 1920, four months before the Silesian Plebiscite, Bertram issued an order that made political activity of local priests dependent on the agreement of the local provost and supported by threat of severe church sanctions if broken. Since 75%-80% of provosts were of Germans, and local priests were regularly Polish Jesuit priests immigrated from Little Poland, that was seen as giving support to the German side in the plebiscite, and the Polish public reacted with anger. Wincenty Witos told Bertram that if not for his order, three quarters of Upper Silesian population would vote for Poland. In the end, almost 60% of Upper Silesians voted for Germany.Compare the results on Upper Silesia plebiscite. The Polish government protested Bertram's decision to the Vatican, and the Polish Foreign Ministry began actions opposing the decree. Conflict with Polish members of the clergy A special committee of 91 priests from Upper Silesia issued a declaration to Holy See in which they warned of the consequences of Bertram's actions and growing \\"bitterness\\" among the population that would harm the Catholic Church in the long term. They called for a boycott of his order and declared loyalty to Vatican. Soon, the priests were supported by senior members of the Polish clergy. On 30 November, at the residence of Cardinals Aleksander Kakowski and Dalbor and Bishops Bilczewski, Sapieha, Teodorowicz, Fulman and Przeździecki issued a letter to Pope to warn him that Bertram engaged in political activity on behalf of German side and threatened to break relations between the Vatican and the Polish state as well as the Polish nation. Thy pleaded with the Pope to revoke Bertram's order. As the consequences of Bertram's order became known, the Polish Parliament debated on breaking up relations with the Vatican or removing the Polish ambassador to the Vatican. Eventually, the Polish government decided to issue a protest note, and the Vatican revoked its delegate to Poland, Achille Ratti, who would later become Pope Pius XI. On 7 November 1922, Bertram lost his episcopal competence in the parishes of Breslau diocese that had become part of Poland, namely in the prior Austro-Hungarian, now Polish eastern Cieszyn Silesia (Polish acquired 1918/1919), and the prior German East Upper Silesia (seized by Poland on 20 June 1922). On 17 December the Holy See established for these areas an exempt Apostolic Administration, which it elevated as the new Diocese of Katowice on 28 October 1925 by the bull Vixdum Poloniae Unitas. The parishes in northwesterly Czechoslovak Cieszyn Silesia (Zaolzie) remained under Bertram's jurisdiction of Breslau. =Last years of Weimar Republic= By his bull \\"Pastoralis officii nostri\\" Pope Pius XI elevated Bertram to Archbishop of Breslau on 13 August 1930, carrying out the stipulations of the concordat between the Free State of Prussia and the Holy See. Bertram then supervised three suffragans within Breslau's new Eastern German Ecclesiastical Province, the dioceses of Berlin and Ermland as well as the Territorial Prelature of Schneidemühl. In 1930, he refused a religious funeral for a well- known Nazi official on the grounds that the principles of National Socialism were incompatible with the Catholic faith.Ronald J. Rychlak. \\"Goldhagen v.

In 1932, he sought the permission of Rome regarding about joining the Nazi Party, but it was refused as the Church wanted no involvement with politics.\\"I forbid,\\" wrote the future Pope Pius XII, \\"that ecclesiastical authorities or church interests be utilized for party politics\\", \\"Three Popes and the Jews\\", Pinchas Lapide, p. 92, 1967, Hawthorn Nazi dictatorship In March 1933, the president of an interfaith group asked for Bertram's aid in protesting the boycott of Jewish business organised by the Nazis but was refused as he regarded it as purely an economic matter and because, in his opinion, the Jewish press had kept silent about the persecution of Catholics.Lapide, 1967, p. 99 On the eve of the Second World War, Nazi Germany and, to a much lesser extent, Poland annexed parts of Czechoslovakia, Sudetenland and Zaolžje/Zaolzie, whose northern part was a component of Bertram's diocese. After the Polish takeover of Zaolžje, which was never internationally recognised, the Polish government requested the Holy See to depose Bertram from jurisdiction in the newly-Polish annexed area.For the parishes in southerly Zaolžje, belonging to the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Olomouc, Poland had achieved likewise the deposition of Archbishop Leopold Prečan of Olomouc. The Holy See complied, and Pope Pius XI then subjected the Catholic parishes in Zaolžje to an apostolic administration under Stanisław Adamski, Bishop of Katowice, who wielded that administration until 31 December 1939.Jerzy Pietrzak, \\"Die politischen und kirchenrechtlichen Grundlagen der Einsetzung Apostolischer Administratoren in den Jahren 1939–1942 und 1945 im Vergleich\\", in: Katholische Kirche unter nationalsozialistischer und kommunistischer Diktatur: Deutschland und Polen 1939–1989, Hans-Jürgen Karp and Joachim Köhler (eds.), (=Forschungen und Quellen zur Kirchen- und Kulturgeschichte Ostdeutschlands; vol. 32), Cologne: Böhlau, 2001, pp. 157–74, at pg. 160; . =World War II= He ordered Church celebrations upon Nazi Germany's victory over Poland and France, with an order to ring bells all across Reich upon the news of the German capture of Warsaw in 1939.Czesław Madajczyk.

Bertram as ex officio head of the German episcopate sent greetings on the occasion of Adolf Hitler's 50th birthday in 1939 in the name of all German Catholic bishops, an act that angered bishop Konrad von Preysing; Bertram was the leading advocate of accommodation as well as the leader of the German church, a combination that reigned in other would-be opponents of Nazism.Phayer, Michael. 2000. The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, pg. 75; Throughout most of World War II Cardinal Bertram remained in Breslau. Bertram opposed what he called the immorality and \\"neopaganism\\" of the Nazi Party. On 23 December 1939 Cesare Orsenigo, Nuncio to Germany, appointed – with effect of 1 January 1940 – Bertram – and Olomouc' Archbishop Leopold Prečan – as apostolic administrators for exactly those Catholic parishes of Zaolžje, where Pius XI had deposed them in 1938.Jerzy Pietrzak, \\"Die politischen und kirchenrechtlichen Grundlagen der Einsetzung Apostolischer Administratoren in den Jahren 1939–1942 und 1945 im Vergleich\\", in: Katholische Kirche unter nationalsozialistischer und kommunistischer Diktatur: Deutschland und Polen 1939–1989, Hans-Jürgen Karp and Joachim Köhler (eds.), (=Forschungen und Quellen zur Kirchen- und Kulturgeschichte Ostdeutschlands; vol. 32), Cologne: Böhlau, 2001, pp. 157–74, at pg. 162. In 1940, Cardinal Bertram condemned the propaganda and planning for Operation Lebensborn and Nazi vitalism and insemination plans as \\"immoral\\", saying that the Lebensborn programme was institutionalized \\"adultery\\".\\"Battle of Births\\", time.com, 5 February 1940. A few months after his death, Time magazine wrote about Cardinal Bertram: > Died. Adolf Cardinal Bertram, 86, outspoken anti-Nazi Archbishop of Breslau > and dean of the German Catholic hierarchy, whose tireless resistance to > Hitler's \\"neopaganism\\" was climaxed last March in his defiance of orders to > evacuate Breslau before the advancing Russians; presumably in Breslau. His > death left the College of Cardinals with 40 members - the fewest in 144 > years.Time, 23 July 1945. In early 1941 Bertram as metropolitan bishop of the Eastern German Ecclesiastical Province and speaker of the Fulda Conference of Bishops, rejected Carl Maria Splett's request to admit the Danzig diocese as member in his ecclesiastical province and at the conference. Last years and death In 1945, during the so-called Siege of Breslau, he resisted pressure from the Nazi government to leave the city, until much of the population was evacuated in the wake of the Soviet assault (Festung Breslau). Bertram finally decided to leave the city in late February or early March 1945 and spent the rest of the war at his summer residence at Castle Johannesberg in Jauernig (Czechoslovak part of Breslau diocese, Sudetenland), where he died on 6 July 1945 at the age of 86. He was buried at the local cemetery in Ves Javorník (Oberjauernig). His body was exhumed in 1991 and was reburied in the metropolitan cathedral in Wrocław, Poland. He was succeeded as Chairman of the Fulda Conference of Catholic Bishops by Josef Frings. Legacy It has been claimed that Bertram scheduled a Requiem Mass upon Hitler's death.e.g Daniel Jonah Goldhagen in \\"Hitler's Willing Executioners\\", 1997, pg. 454 and \\"A Moral Reckoning\\", 2002, pg. 266 However, this claim has been disputed by Ronald Rychlak: > In point of fact, this is what we know: Bertram was elderly and ill when the > war ended. When he died (just weeks later), his papers included a > handwritten order scheduling a Requiem Mass for all Germans who died in the > war, including Hitler (who was originally reported to have died while > fighting the Red Army), and for the protection of the Catholic Church in > Germany.

Background The Ottoman Empire had conquered the region in the early 16th century, but never gained complete control. Regional pockets of Ottoman control through local proxy rulers maintained the Ottomans' reach throughout Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). With the turn of the 19th century came reforms. Work began on a Baghdad Railway in 1888; by 1915 it had only four gaps, and travel time from Istanbul to Baghdad had fallen to 21 days. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company had obtained exclusive rights to petroleum deposits throughout the Persian Empire, except in the provinces of Azerbaijan, Ghilan, Mazendaran, Asdrabad, and Khorasan.The Encyclopedia Americana, 1920, v.28, p.403 In 1914, before the war, the British government had contracted with the company for oil for the navy. The operational area of the Mesopotamian campaign was limited to the lands watered by the rivers Euphrates and Tigris. The main challenge was moving troops and supplies through the swamps and deserts which surrounded the area of conflict. Shortly after the European war started, the British sent a military force to protect Abadan, the site of one of the world's earliest oil refineries. British operational planning included landing troops in the Shatt-al-Arab. The reinforced 6th (Poona) Division of the British Indian Army was assigned the task, designated as Indian Expeditionary Force D (IEFD). Aside from oil, a major British interest in Mesopotamia, especially in the minds of politicians like Austen Chamberlain (Secretary of State for India) and former Viceroy Lord Curzon, was in maintaining British prestige in the eyes of India's Muslim population. At first the campaign was run by the India Office and Indian Army, with little input from the War Office.Woodward, 1998, p.113 The Ottoman Fourth Army was located in the region. It was composed of two corps: the XII Corps, with the 35th and 36th Divisions at Mosul, and XIII Corps, with the 37th and 38th Divisions at Baghdad. On 29 October 1914, after the pursuit of Goeben and Breslau, Breslau bombarded the Russian Black Sea port of Theodosia. On 30 October the High Command in Istanbul changed the force distribution. On 2 November Grand Vizier Said Halim Pasha expressed regret to the Allies for the actions of the navy. Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Sazonov said it was too late and that Russia considered the raid an act of war. The Cabinet tried to explain that hostilities were begun without its sanction by German officers serving in the navy. The Allies insisted on reparations to Russia, the dismissal of German officers from the Goeben and Breslau, and the internment of the German ships until the end of the war, but before the Ottoman government could respond, Great Britain and France declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 5 November. The Ottoman Committee of Union and Progress's official Declaration of War came on 14 November. When the Caucasus Campaign became a reality with the victorious Bergmann Offensive, Enver Pasha sent the 37th Division and XIII Corps Headquarters to the Caucasus in support of the Third Army. The entire XII Corps was deployed to the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Fourth Army Headquarters was sent to Syria, to replace the Second Army Headquarters, which was sent to Istanbul. In place of the Fourth Army was the \\"Iraq Area Command\\" with only the 38th Division under its command.Edward J. Erickson, Ottoman Army Effectiveness in World War I: a comparative study (Routledge, New York, 2007), 67, 68. Mesopotamia was a low priority area for the Ottomans, and they did not expect any major action in the region. Regiments of the XII and XIII Corps were maintained at low levels in peacetime. Lieutenant Colonel Süleyman Askerî Bey became the commander. He redeployed portions of the 38th Division at the mouth of Shatt-al-Arab. The rest of the defensive force was stationed at Basra. The Ottoman General Staff did not even possess a proper map of Mesopotamia. They tried to draw a map with the help of people who had worked in Iraq before the war, although this attempt failed. Enver Pasha bought two German maps scaled 1/1,500,000. Operations1914= 1914, Initial British offence On 6 November 1914, British offensive action began with the naval bombardment of the old fort at Fao, located at the point where the Shatt-al-Arab meets the Persian Gulf. At the Fao Landing, the British Indian Expeditionary Force D (IEF D), comprising the 6th (Poona) Division led by Lieutenant General Arthur Barrett with Sir Percy Cox as Political Officer, was opposed by 350 Ottoman troops and 4 guns. After a sharp engagement, the fort was overrun. By mid-November the Poona Division was fully ashore and began moving towards the city of Basra. The same month, the ruler of Kuwait, Sheikh Mubarak Al-Sabah, contributed to the Allied war effort by sending forces to attack Ottoman troops at Umm Qasr, Safwan, Bubiyan, and Basra. In exchange the British government recognized Kuwait as an \\"independent government under British protection.\\" There is no report on the exact size and nature of Mubarak's attack, though Ottoman forces did retreat from those positions weeks later. Mubarak soon removed the Ottoman symbol from the Kuwaiti flag and replaced it with “Kuwait” written in Arabic script. Mubarak’s participation and previous exploits in obstructing the completion of the Baghdad railway helped the British safeguard the Persian Gulf by preventing Ottoman and German reinforcement. On 22 November, the British occupied the city of Basra after a short fight with soldiers of the Iraq Area Command under Suphi Bey, the Governor of Basra. The Ottoman troops abandoned Basra and retreated up the river. After establishing order in the town the British continued their advance, and at the Battle of Qurna they succeeded in capturing Subhi Bey and 1,000 of his troops. This put the British in a very strong position, ensuring that Basra and the oilfields would be protected from any Ottoman advance. The main Ottoman army, under the overall command of Khalil Pasha, was located 275 miles to the north-west around Baghdad. They made only weak efforts to dislodge the British. =1915= File:Meso- WW1-2.jpgJuly, British offence File:Kut1915.jpgSeptember, British offence File:Ctesiphon1915.jpgNovember, British offence File:Meso-WW1-3.jpgNovember, British offence (detail) On 2 January, Süleyman Askerî Bey took over as head of the Iraq Area Command. With Gallipoli, the Caucasus, and Palestine taking priority, the Ottoman Army had few resources to move to Mesopotamia. Süleyman Askerî Bey sent letters to Arab sheiks in an attempt to organize them to fight against the British. He wanted to retake the Shatt-al-Arab region at any cost. Early on the morning of 12 April, Süleyman Askerî attacked the British camp at Shaiba in what became known as the Battle of Shaiba. He had about 4,000 regular troops and about 14,000 Arab irregulars provided by Arab sheiks. Although the irregulars proved ineffective, the Ottoman infantry launched a series of relentless attacks on the fortified British camp and later attempted by bypass it. When the British cavalry and infantry counterattacked Suleyman Askari pulled his troops back. The next day the British attacked his defensive positions. It was a hard fought infantry battle in which the British infantry overcame tough Ottoman opposition. Ottoman losses numbered 2400 men killed, wounded, or taken prisoner, as well as two artillery field pieces.A. J. Barker, The First Iraq War, 1914–1918; Britain's Mesopotamian Campaign (Enigma Books, New York, 2009), 51–54 The retreat ended 75 miles up the river at Hamisiye. Süleyman Askerî had been wounded at Shaiba. Disappointed and depressed, he shot himself at the hospital in BaghdadEdward J. Erickson, Ordered to Die: A history of the Ottoman Army in the First World War (Greenwood Press, Wesport, CT 2001), 110. In his place Colonel Nureddin was appointed commander of the Iraq Area Command on 20 April 1915. Nureddin was one of the few officers to reach high command without the benefit of a staff college education. He did, however, have extensive combat experience.Edward J. Erickson, Ottoman Army Effectiveness in World War I: a comparative study (Routledge, New York, 2007), 75. Due to the unexpected success British command reconsidered their plan and General Sir John Nixon was sent in April 1915 to take command. He ordered Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend to advance to Kut or even to Baghdad if possible.A. J. Barker, The Bastard War, The Mesopotamia Campaign of 1914–1918 (Dial Press, New York, 1967), 96–97. Townshend and his small army advanced up the Tigris river. They defeated several Ottoman forces sent to halt him. In July 1915, a force led by G. F. Gorringe captured the city of Nasiriyah, capturing the Turks' largest supply depot in southern Mesopotamia. Logistically, his advance was very difficult to sustain, but it was sustained. In late September 1915, amidst the recent defeat of Serbia and entry of Bulgaria into the war and concerns about German attempts to incite jihad in Persia and Afghanistan, Grey (Foreign Secretary) and other politicians encouraged a further 100-mile push to Baghdad. The CIGS Murray thought this logistically unwise, but Kitchener advised the Dardanelles Committee (21 October) that Baghdad be seized for the sake of prestige then abandoned. Enver Pasha worried about the possible fall of Baghdad. He realized the mistake of underestimating the importance of the Mesopotamian campaign. He ordered the 35th Division and Mehmet Fazıl Pasha to return to their old location, which was Mosul. The 38th Division was reconstituted. The Sixth Army was created on 5 October 1915, and its commander was a 72-year-old German general, Colmar von der Goltz. Von der Goltz was a famous military historian who had written several classic books on military operations. He had also spent many years working as a military adviser in the Ottoman Empire. However, he was in Thrace commanding the Ottoman First Army and would not reach the theater for some time. Colonel Nureddin the former commander of the Iraq Area Command was still in charge on the ground. On 22 November, Townshend and Nureddin fought a battle at Ctesiphon, a town 25 miles south of Baghdad. The conflict lasted five days. The battle was a stalemate as both the Ottomans and the British ended up retreating from the battlefield. Townshend concluded that a full scale retreat was necessary. However, Nureddin realized the British were retreating and cancelled his retreat, then followed the British.Edward J. Erickson, Ottoman Army Effectiveness in World War I: a comparative study (Routledge, New York, 2007), 76, 77. Townshend withdrew his division in good order back to Kut-al-Amara. He halted and fortified the position. Nureddin pursued with his forces. He tried to encircle the British with his XVIII Corps composed of the 45th Division, 51st Division and 2nd Tribal Cavalry Brigade.Edward J. Erickson, Ottoman Army Effectiveness in World War I: a comparative study (Routledge, New York, 2007), 80. The exhausted and depleted British force was urged back to the defenses of Kut-al-Amara. The retreat finalized on 3 December. Nureddin encircled the British at Kut-al-Amara, and sent other forces down river to prevent the British from marching to the relief of the garrison. On 7 December, the siege of Kut began. From the Ottoman perspective the siege of prevented the Sixth Army from performing other operations. From the British perspective, defending Kut as opposed to retreating back to Basra was a mistake since Kut was isolated. It could be defended, but it could not be resupplied. Von der Goltz helped the Ottoman forces build defensive positions around Kut. The Sixth Army was reorganized into two corps, the XIII and the XVIII. Nureddin Pasha gave command to Von der Goltz. With the reorganization the Sixth Army laid siege to the British. New fortified positions established down river fended off any attempt to rescue Townshend. Townshend suggested an attempt to break out but this was initially rejected by Sir John Nixon; however he relented. Nixon established a relief force under the command of General Aylmer. General Aylmer made three major attempts to break the siege, but each effort was unsuccessful. =1916= On 20 January, Enver Pasha replaced Nureddin Pasha with Colonel Halil Kut (Khalil Pasha). Nureddin Pasha did not want to work with a German general. He sent a telegram to the War Ministry \\"The Iraq Army has already proven that it does not need the military knowledge of Goltz Pasha ...\\" After the first failure, General Nixon was replaced by General Lake. British forces received small quantities of supplies from the air. These drops were not enough to feed the garrison, though. Halil Kut forced the British to choose between starving and surrendering, though in the meantime they would try to lift the siege. Between January and March 1916, both Townshend and Aylmer launched several attacks in an attempt to lift the siege. In sequence, the attacks took place at the Battle of Sheikh Sa'ad, the Battle of the Wadi, the Battle of Hanna, and the Battle of Dujaila Redoubt. These series of British attempts to break through the encirclement did not succeed and their costs were heavy. Both sides suffered high casualties. In February, XIII Corps received 2nd Infantry Division as a reinforcement. Food and hopes were running out for Townshend in Kut-al-Amara. Disease was spreading rapidly and could not be cured. On 19 April Field Marshal Von der Goltz died of cholera. On 24 April, an attempt by the paddle steamer Julnar to re-supply the town by river failed. With that there was no way the British could resupply Kut. After repeated attempts to break through, the Ottoman attacks on the city. Rather than wait for reinforcements, Townshend surrendered on 29 April 1916. The remaining force in Kut-al-Amara of 13,164 soldiers became captives of the Ottomans. The British viewed the loss of Kut as a humiliating defeat. It had been many years since such a large body of British Army soldiers had surrendered to an enemy. Also this loss followed only four months after the British defeat at the Battle of Gallipoli. Nearly all the British commanders involved in the failure to rescue Townshend were removed from command. The Ottomans proved they were good at holding defensive positions against superior forces. The British refused to let the defeat at Kut stand. Further attempts to advance in Mesopotamia were ordered by the politicians on the War Committee (18 September), including Curzon and Chamberlain, who argued that there would be no net savings in troops if a passive policy in the Middle East encouraged Muslim unrest in India, Persia and Afghanistan, and despite the opposition of Robertson.Woodward, 1998, pp. 118–9 A major problem for the British was the lack of logistical infrastructure. When ships arrived at Basra, they had to be unloaded by small boats which then unloaded their cargo which was then stored in warehouses, which there were not enough of in Basra. Ships often sat for days waiting to be unloaded. Then supplies had to be sent north along the river in shallow draft river steamers because there were almost no roads north. Usually the amount of supplies being sent north was barely adequate to supply the forces in place. A plan to build a railway was rejected by the Indian Government in 1915, but after Kut it was approved.A. J. Barker, The Bastard War, The Mesopotamia Campaign of 1914–1918 (Dial Press, New York, 1967), 148–149. After the defeat at Kut, the British made a major effort to improve the ability to move men and equipment into theater, and keep them supplied. The port at Basra was greatly improved so that ships could be quickly unloaded.A. J. Barker, The Bastard War, The Mesopotamia Campaign of 1914–1918 (Dial Press, New York, 1967), 271. Good roads were built around Basra. Rest camps and supply dumps were created to receive men and material from the port. More and better river steamers were put into service moving supplies up river.A. J. Barker, The Bastard War, The Mesopotamia Campaign of 1914–1918 (Dial Press, New York, 1967), 272. New hospitals were also set up to better care for the sick and wounded. As a result, the British were able to bring more troops and equipment to the front lines and keep them properly supplied for a new offensive. The new commander, General Maude, despite receiving secret orders from Robertson not to attempt to take Baghdad, was given additional reinforcements and equipment. For the next six months he trained and organized his army. At the same time, the Ottoman Sixth Army was growing weaker. Khalil Pasha received very few replacements, and ended up disbanding the weak 38th Division and used its soldiers as replacements for his other divisions, the 46th, 51st, 35th, and 52nd.Edward J. Erickson, Ordered to Die: A history of the Ottoman Army in the First World War (Greenwood Press, Wesport, CT 2001), 164. Robertson changed his mind when it seemed that the Russians might advance to Mosul, removing any Turkish threat to Mesopotamia, and authorised Maude to attack in December 1916.Woodward, 1998, pp. 122, 167 File:Meso Campaign.jpg Indian anti-aircraft machine gunners in action during the Battle of Sheikh Sa'ad File:British Gun boat on River Tigris (WWI).pngthumbBritish gun boat on the Tigris File:Mesopotamian campaign 6th Army field HQ.pngthumb200pxOttoman Sixth Army field HQ =1917= 1917, General Maude's Army captures Kut Maude's offensive was launched on 13 December 1916. The British advanced up both sides of the Tigris river, forcing the Ottoman army out of a number of fortified positions along the way. General Maude's offensive was methodical, organized, and successful. Khalil Pasha was able to concentrate most of his forces against Maude near Kut. However, Maude switched his advance to the other bank of the Tigris, bypassing most of the Ottoman forces. The Ottoman XVIII Corps escaped destruction only by fighting some desperate rear guard actions. It did lose quite a bit of equipment and supplies.Edward J. Erickson, Ordered to Die: A history of the Ottoman Army in the First World War (Greenwood Press, Wesport, CT 2001), 165. The British occupied Kut and continued to advance up the Tigris. By early March, the British were at the outskirts of Baghdad, and the Baghdad garrison, under the direct command of the Governor of Baghdad province Halil Kut (Khalil Pasha), tried to stop them on the Diyala river. General Maude outmanoeuvred the Ottoman forces, destroyed an Ottoman regiment and captured the Ottoman defensive positions. Khalil Pasha retreated in disarray out of the city. On 11 March 1917, the British entered Baghdad and colonial sources claim the Iraqi people greeted them as liberators. The British Indian Army played a significant role in the capture of Baghdad. Amidst the confusion of the retreat a large part of the Ottoman army (some 15,000 soldiers) were captured. A week after the city fell, General Maude issued the oft-quoted Proclamation of Baghdad, which contained the famous line \\"our armies do not come into your cities and lands as conquerors or enemies, but as liberators\\". Khalil Pasha withdrew his battered Sixth Army up river and established his headquarters in Mosul. He had about 30,000 total troops with which to oppose Maude. In April, he received the 2nd Infantry Division, but overall the Ottoman strategic position was bad in the spring of 1917.Edward J. Erickson, Ordered to Die: A history of the Ottoman Army in the First World War (Greenwood Press, Wesport, CT 2001), 166. After the capture of Baghdad, Maude stopped his advance. He felt his supply lines were too long, conditions in the summer made campaigning difficult and he had been denied reinforcements he felt he needed. General Maude died of cholera on 18 November. He was replaced by General William Marshall who halted operations for the winter. File:Maude in Baghdad.jpgBritish troops entering Baghdad, March 1917.

In March 1918, Britain faced an uprising by a rebel organization called Jam'iya al-Nahda al-Islamiya in Najaf, and laid siege to the city until May, when the rebels surrendered. For the rest of the 1918, the British had to move troops to the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in support of the Battle of Megiddo. General Marshall moved some of the forces east in support of General Lionel Dunsterville's operations in Persia during the summer of 1918. His very powerful army was \\"astonishingly inactive, not only in the hot season but through most of the cold\\".Cyril Falls, \\"The Great War\\" pg. 329 The fight in Mesopotamia was not wanted anymore. Negotiation of armistice conditions between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire began with the turn of October. General Marshall, following instructions from the War Office that \\"every effort was to be made to score as heavily as possible on the Tigris before the whistle blew\\", went on the offensive for the last time. General Alexander Cobbe commanded a British force from Baghdad on 23 October 1918. Within two days it covered 120 kilometers, reaching the Little Zab River, where it met and engaged Ismail Hakki Bey's Sixth Army, most of which was captured in the resulting Battle of Sharqat.

Armistice of Mudros, October On 30 October 1918, the Armistice of Mudros was signed and both parties accepted their current positions. General Marshall accepted the surrender of Khalil Pasha and the Ottoman 6th Army on the same day, but Cobbe did not hold his current position as the armistice required, and continued to advance on Mosul in the face of Turkish protests.Peter Sluglett, \\"The Primacy of Oil in Britain’s Iraq Policy\\", in the book \\"Britain in Iraq: 1914–1932\\" London: Ithaca Press, 1976, pp. 103–116 British troops marched unopposed into the city on the 14 November 1918. The ownership of Mosul Province and its rich oil fields became an international issue. The war in Mesopotamia was over on 14 November 1918. It was 15 days after the Armistice and one day after the occupation of Constantinople.

Stanley Maude.jpgSir Frederick Stanley Maude Aftermath Indian Cavalryman shares his rations with starving Christian girls With British Indian forces already on the ground, the British imported civil servants from India who had previous knowledge and experience on how the government of a colony is supposed to run. The expulsion of Ottomans from the region shook the centuries-old power balance. Arabs who believed that the expulsion of the Ottomans would lead to greater independence and fought against the Ottoman forces along the Allies faced another dilemma. They were disappointed with the arguments regarding the establishment of British Mandate of Mesopotamia. Three important anticolonial secret societies had been formed in the region during 1918 and 1919. At Najaf, Jamiyat an Nahda al Islamiya (The League of the Islamic Awakening) was organized. Al Jamiya al Wataniya al Islamiya (The Muslim National League) was formed with the object of organizing and mobilizing the population for major resistance. In February 1919, in Baghdad, a coalition of Shia merchants, Sunni teachers and civil servants, Sunni and Shia ulama, and Iraqi officers formed the Haras al Istiqlal (the Guardians of Independence). The Istiqlal had member groups in Karbala, Najaf, Kut, and Hillah. The British were in a precarious situation with the Issue of Mosul. They were adopting almost desperate measures to protect their interests. The Iraqi revolt against the British developed just after they declared their authority. It was put down by the RAF Iraq Command during the summer of 1920. The Ottoman parliament mostly accepted the cession of the region, but they had a different view on the issue of Mosul. They declared the Misak-ı Milli. Misak-ı Milli stated that the Mosul Province was a part of their heartland, based on a common past, history, concept of morals and laws. Presumably, from a British perspective, if Mustafa Kemal Atatürk succeeded in securing the stability in his efforts to establish Republic of Turkey, he would have turned his attention to recovering Mosul and penetrate into Mesopotamia, where the native population would probably join him. The British Foreign Secretary attempted to disclaim any existence of oil in the Mosul area. On 23 January 1923, Lord Curzon argued that the existence of oil was no more than hypothetical. However, according to Armstrong, \\"England wanted oil. Mosul and Kurds were the key.\\"Harold Courtenay Armstrong Gray Wolf, Mustafa Kemal: An Intimate Study of a Dictator. page 225 Casualties Madras Regiment War Memorial, Bangalore, mentions lives lost in Mesopotamia by the Madras Sappers. The British Empire forces suffered 85,197 battle casualties in Mesopotamia. There were also 820,418 hospitalizations for non-battle causes, mostly sickness. Of those, 16,712 died, 634,889 were treated and put back on duty in-theater, and 154,343 were permanently evacuated from the theater. Those evacuated accounted for some 18.8% of total non-battle casualties, while those who died were 2%. By comparison, 49% of those wounded in battle (26,814 men) were evacuated, and 8.9% (5,281) died.T. J. Mitchell and G. M. Smith. \\"Medical Services: Casualties and Medical Statistics of the Great War.\\" From the \\"Official History of the Great War\\". Page 211. Thousands more died out of theater from injuries and sickness incurred here, or died in Ottoman captivity. Total British military deaths in the Mesopotamian Campaign, including from the latter causes, were 38,842 (1,434 officers and 37,408 men),\\"Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire\\" (London: HMSO, 1920). Page 243. including 28,578 from sickness and other non-battle causes (including prisoners). The unusually high ratio of non-battle to battle casualties in Mesopotamia, and the unusually high incidence of permanent losses among non-battle casualties had much to do with the geography of the area of operations. It was unhygienic, extremely hot in the summer, extremely cold in the winter, composed primarily of either sandy deserts or marshes, and was underdeveloped, meaning men had to be transported large distances for medical attention.Mitchell and Smith, p. 219 Ottoman casualties were higher, totaling 325,000. Not counting losses due to disease (disease deaths were more numerous than battle deaths by a factor of two for the Ottomans in the war overall, and this proportion was even higher in Mesopotamia),Erickson 2001, p. 240 Ottoman irrecoverable battle casualties totaled 55,858 (13,069 KIA, 22,385 WIA, 20,404 POW). They were divided up as follows:Erickson 2001, Appendix F, pp. 237–238 * Basra 1914: 1,400 (100 KIA, 200 WIA, 1,200 POW) * Qurna 1914: 1,495 (150 KIA, 300 WIA, 1,045 POW) * Shaiba 1915: 6,700 (2,000 KIA, 4,000 WIA, 700 POW) * 1st Kut 1915: 5,200 (1,600 KIA, 2,400 WIA, 1,200 POW) * Ctesiphon 1915: 14,700 (4,500 KIA, 9,000 WIA, 1,200 POW) * Siege of Kut 1915/1916: 4,000 (1,600 KIA, 2,400 WIA) * Relief of Kut 1916: 3,541 (619 KIA, 1,585 WIA, 1,337 POW) * 2nd Kut/Baghdad 1917: 6,000 (2,000 KIA, 4,000 WIA) * Mesopotamia 1918 total: 12,822 (500 KIA, 1,000 WIA, 11,322 POW) The WIA figures only include irrecoverable losses (crippled or died of wounds). Going by Erickson's estimates, total wounded outnumbered seriously wounded by 2.5:1 for the war.Erickson 2001, p. 240 Applying that same ratio to the Mesopotamia Campaign produces a total battle casualty count of about 89,500 (13,069 KIA, 56,000 WIA, 20,404 POW). By the end of 1918 the British had deployed 350,000–410,000 men into the area. 112,000 of them were combat troops. The vast majority of the British empire forces in this campaign were recruited from India.

Language Traditionally, Kootenai people have spoken the Kutenai language, a language isolate. It has a dictionary and grammar and is written in the Latin script. History The Kootenai people lived along the Kootenai River in Idaho, Montana, and British Columbia. They were hunter-gatherers, and salmon was an important staple to their diets. They have permanent winter villages of cone-shaped houses made from wooden poles and rush mats. In 1855 the tribe refused to sign a treaty with the US government that would require them to cede their aboriginal lands in Idaho and consolidate with several other smaller tribes in Montana. The Dawes Act broke up tribal land holdings into individual allotments. Due to illegal land loss, the tribe was awarded $425,000 in a land claims settlement in 1960. On September 20, 1974, the 67 members of the Kootenai Tribe formally declared war on the United States, seeking federal Initial demands were for a reservation and compensation for of ancestral They did not engage in violence, and, by calling attention to their situation, the tribe was deeded of federal land surrounding the former mission in Bonners Ferry.

Schleicher was the first scholar to compose a text in PIE. The fable is entitled (\\"The Sheep [Ewe] and the Horses [Eoh]\\"). At later dates, various scholars have published revised versions of Schleicher's fable, as the idea of what PIE should look like has changed over time. The fable may serve as an illustration of the significant changes that the reconstructed language has gone through during the last 150 years of scholarly efforts. The first revision of Schleicher's fable was made by Hermann Hirt (published by Arntz in 1939).

Notable differences Some of the differences between the texts are just varying spelling conventions: w and ', for example, are only different ways to indicate the same sound, a consonantal u. However, many other differences are to be explained by widely diverging views on the phonological and morphological systems of PIE. Schleichers reconstruction assumed that the o/e vocalism was secondary, and his version of PIE is much more closely based on Sanskrit than modern reconstructions. Hirt introduced the o/e vocalism, syllabic resonants, labiovelars and palatalized velars. Lehmann and Zgusta introduced a few alternative lexemes (the relative pronoun '; the word ' 'man'), and made some first steps into the direction of accepting laryngeals. Their text features an h (') for what they seem to accept as a single laryngeal of PIE. Adams was the first one to fully reflect the laryngeal theory in his version of the fable. Judging from the text, he seems to assume four different laryngeal phonemes. Consequently, Adam's text no longer shows long ā. Kortlandts version is a radical deviation from the prior texts in a number of ways. First, he followed the glottalic theory, writing glottalic plosives with a following apostrophe (t’) and omitting aspirated voiced plosives. Second, he substitutes the abstract laryngeal signs with their supposed phonetic values: ' = ' (glottal stop), ' = ' (pharyngeal fricative), ' = ' (pharyngeal fricative with lip rounding). Kortlandt also has a different opinion about ablaut grades in many verbal and nominal forms, compared to the other scholars. In popular culture PIE is used in a short dialogue between the human astronauts and an alien \\"Engineer\\" in Ridley Scott's movie Prometheus. In an early scene, the android 'David' (played by Michael Fassbender) practices reciting Schleicher's fable to the interactive computer, in preparation for first contact with the \\"Engineers\\".

She was named for Henry Hulbert. History Hulbert was launched by Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, 28 June 1918; sponsored by Mrs. V. C. Hulbert, widow of Lieutenant Hulbert; and commissioned 27 October 1920, Lieutenant S. A. Maher in command. Following shakedown training out of Norfolk, Virginia, Hulbert took part in destroyer maneuvers in the Atlantic until June 1921, when she assisted in ordnance tests on obsolete American and captured German ships. For the next year, the ship operated out of Newport with other destroyers. Hulbert sailed 20 June 1922 for duty on the Asiatic Station, steaming via the Mediterranean and Ceylon to Chefoo, China, 26 August. The ship patrolled Chinese and Philippine waters in the year that followed, protecting American interests during the Chinese Civil War. On the night of 28 February 1923, six crew were killed in the engine room when furnace oil flared back and trapped them.United Press, \\"Six Killed In Warship Blast\\", The Madera Daily Tribune, Madera, California, Thursday 1 March 1923, Volume XXXI, Number 98, page 1. She also took part in periodic fleet exercises designed to keep her crew and equipment at maximum readiness. Hulbert took part in the evacuation of American civilians and missionaries in March 1927 and September 1928. Completing this lengthy tour of duty in the Far East, she sailed 22 July 1929 from Yokohama, arriving San Diego 17 August. During the remainder of the year, Hulbert acted as plane guard for carriers and off California, thus helping to develop carrier-group tactics. She took part in important fleet exercises on both coasts, during the period from 1930 to 1934 and arrived Philadelphia 14 August 1934. She decommissioned there 17 October 1934 and was placed in reserve. Hulbert was converted to a seaplane tender, recommissioning at New York Navy Yard as AVD-6 on 2 August 1940. She arrived in San Diego 24 August via Guantanamo Bay and the Panama Canal Zone, and began servicing Patrol Wing 1 on operations off the West Coast, helping to perfect America's seaplane reconnaissance capability. Hulbert sailed 8 May 1941 for Pearl Harbor, where she became headquarters ship for the seaplane wing and continued servicing and repairing her planes. World War II On the morning of 7 December 1941, during the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hulbert was moored at the Submarine Base, Pearl Harbor. General Quarters sounded just before 08:00, and the ship's antiaircraft batteries immediately opened fire at attacking planes. This vessel went to general quarters when the Japanese attack was first sighted by the watch aboard, and is believed to have been the first ship in the fleet to open fire. As the Japanese directed their attention to Ford Island and the battleships, she shot down one torpedo plane at 0758, shared in bringing down a dive bomber at about 0820 and damaged several other aircraft. After the attack the ship assisted in the rescue effort. After loading ammunition, she moved to Hilo 9 December to set up an advance base for the all-important patrol bombers. Hulbert was also called upon to aid aircraft at sea, as on Christmas Day she repaired a seaplane at sea and then towed it for nearly 3 days when heavy seas prevented a safe takeoff. After sundown on 30 December 1941 Hulbert was engaged by Japanese submarine I-1 while moored. The IJN vessel claimed moderate damage and hit the adjacent pier. Hulbert returned fire, aided by a local Coast Artillery unit.Submarine Type J-1 The ship also made supply runs to Palmyra Atoll before moving north to Kodiak 6 June 1942. The Japanese had occupied Kiska and Attu as part of the abortive Midway Offensive, and Hulbert was assigned to tend the seaplanes of VP-43 during reconnaissance flights and bombing raids on those islands. The ship also steamed to Seguam Island 30 August 1942, landing a party of marines to search for a Japanese radio station. Next day, she arrived in Atka to aid torpedoed tender USS Casco, alternating between salvage efforts and seaplane tending during September. Hulbert sailed 4 October for supplies and repairs at San Francisco, California. Hulbert stranded on Attu, 1943. She was again underway from Seattle, Washington 8 December 1942 for Kodiak where the ship serviced patrol bombers during the first months of 1943. In May Hulbert moved to Amchitka, acting as communications ship during the recapture of Attu that spring. She moved again to Attu in June, to provide fuel and communications services for seaplanes and torpedo boats but was blown ashore in Massacre Bay during a severe storm 30 June 1943. Hulbert's hull was seriously damaged and, after temporary repairs at Dutch Harbor, she arrived in Seattle 30 August for a major overhaul. The ship was reclassified DD-342 on 1 December 1943, and sailed 15 January 1944 to San Diego to take up new duties as an escort ship. For the remainder of the war Hulbert acted as plane guard and screen ship for dozens of new escort carriers as they made ready to join America's striking fleet in the Far East. The ship also served as a maneuvering torpedo target during pilot training and rescued a dozen pilots during this period. After the war's end, Hulbert sailed 30 September, escorting carrier USS Ranger to the Panama Canal Zone and arrived Philadelphia 17 October 1945. Fate She decommissioned 2 November 1945 and was sold for scrap on 31 October 1946 to Ship Shape, Inc., Philadelphia. Hulbert received two battle stars for World War II service. As of 2009, no other ship has been named USS Hulbert.

Career In addition to his role as the Post music editor, Hume hosted a long-running classical music program on WGMS radio in Washington, D.C., and was guest commentator for the New York Metropolitan Opera intermission broadcasts. He was also a professor of music at Georgetown University from 1950 to 1977 and adjunct professor of music at Yale University from 1975 to 1983. He was a member of the American Association of University Professors, the Music Critics Association, and the Cosmos Club. He received a Peabody Award in 1977 for his outstanding achievement in music criticism, and received honorary degrees from Thiel College, Rosary College, and Georgetown University. In addition, he published several books, including Catholic Church Music (1956), where he refers in passing to himself as a Catholic convert from Protestantism; and a biography of Verdi (1977). Awards and honors In honor of Hume's great influence on American music, on October 20, 1979, he was awarded the prestigious University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit. Established in 1964, this award sought \\"to bring a declaration of appreciation to an individual each year that has made a significant contribution to the world of music and helped to create a climate in which our talents may find valid expression.\\" The Truman incident Hume was best known for his critical review in December 1950 of a concert by Margaret Truman and the scathing letter he later received from her father, President Harry S. Truman. Truman called Hume \\"an eight ulcer man on four ulcer pay.\\" He further told him: :It seems to me that you are a frustrated old man who wishes he could have been successful. When you write such poppy-cock as was in the back section of the paper you work for it shows conclusively that you're off the beam and at least four of your ulcers are at work. :Some day I hope to meet you.

I hope you'll accept that statement as a worse insult than a reflection on your ancestry. Truman was criticized by many for the letter. However, he pointed out that he wrote it as a loving father and not as the president. Years later, Hume and Truman did meet when Hume made a visit on him at the Truman Presidential Library. There, Truman showed Hume around the library, which Hume later recalled as a \\"wonderful visit.\\" References Category:Georgetown University faculty Category:Peabody Award winners Category:1915 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Cosmos Club members Category:20th-century American journalists ","title":"Paul Hume"},{"id":"2468607","text":"Ornitholestes (meaning \\"bird robber\\") is a small theropod dinosaur of the late Jurassic (Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation, middle Kimmeridgian age, about 154 million years agoTurner, C.E. and Peterson, F., (1999). \\"Biostratigraphy of dinosaurs in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of the Western Interior, U.S.A.\\" Pp. 77–114 in Gillette, D.D. (ed.), Vertebrate Paleontology in Utah. Utah Geological Survey Miscellaneous Publication 99-1.) of Western Laurasia (the area that was to become North America). To date, Ornitholestes is known only from a single partial skeleton with a badly crushed skull found at the Bone Cabin Quarry near Medicine Bow, Wyoming, in 1900. It was described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1903. An incomplete hand was later attributed to Ornitholestes, although it now appears to belong to Tanycolagreus. The type (and only known) species is O. hermanni. The specific name honors the American Museum of Natural History preparator Adam Hermann. Description Life restoration of Ornitholestes Ornitholestes was a bipedal carnivore.Lambert (1993), p. 79 Its head was proportionally smaller than that of most other predatory dinosaurs, but the skull was heavily built, with a short snout and robust lower jaw.Paul (1988a), p. 306; Norman (1985), p. 42; Norman (1990), p. 293 The orbits (eye sockets) were quite large, measuring over 25 percent of the skull's length.Osborn (1903), p. 460; Chure (1998), p. 238 There is no indication of a bony eye ring.Paul (1988b), p. 6 The front teeth of Ornitholestes were somewhat conical, with reduced serrations; the back teeth were recurved and more sharply serrated, similar to those of other theropod dinosaurs.Paul (1988b), p. 3; Norman (1990), p. 293 Henry Fairfield Osborn (1903) counted four teeth in the premaxilla, of which the front tooth was the largest in the upper jaw.Osborn (1903), p. 460; Osborn (1917), p. 734 In contrast, Gregory S. Paul (1988) depicted the skull with only three premaxillary teeth remaining, much smaller than those illustrated by Osborn.Paul (1988b), p. 4; Norman (1990), p. 293 Each maxilla (main tooth- bearing bone in the upper jaw) contained ten teeth, and each dentary (tooth- bearing bone in the lower jaw) contained twelve teeth.Osborn (1903), p. 460 The tooth rows of Ornitholestes were short, with the dentary (lower) row being even shorter than the maxillary (upper) row,Paul (1988b), p. 3; Norman (1990), p. 292 even though the dentary bone itself was exceptionally long at the back, reaching a point below the middle of the eye socket.Cristiano dal Sasso & Simone Maganuco, 2011, Scipionyx samniticus (Theropoda: Compsognathidae) from the Lower Cretaceous of Italy — Osteology, ontogenetic assessment, phylogeny, soft tissue anatomy, taphonomy and palaeobiology, Memorie della Società Italiana de Scienze Naturali e del Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano XXXVII(I): 1-281 Teeth did not extend as far back as the orbits, and neither tooth row spanned much more than one-third of the skull.Osborn (1903), p. 460; Norman (1990), p. 293 Illustration of the holotype skull An area of broken bone near the external naris (nostril) appears to bulge upward, which led Gregory S. Paul to suggest in Predatory Dinosaurs of the World (1988) that Ornitholestes had a nasal horn \\"rather like a chicken's comb in looks.\\"Paul (1988a), p. 303 Both Oliver W.M. Rauhut (2003) and Kenneth Carpenter et al. (2005a) rejected that interpretation, and indicated that the upward flare of bone was due to post-mortem crushing of the skull.Rauhut (2003), p. 27; Carpenter et al. (2005a), p. 53 Paul's updated illustration of Ornitholestes in his 2010 Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs no longer contains the nasal horn.Paul (2010), p. 123 Ornitholestes had a relatively short neck with a slight sigmoidal (S-shaped) curve.Carpenter et al. (2005a), pp. 49, 54 The tail was long and whiplike, comprising over half of the body's length.Osborn (1917), p. 734; Lambert (1993), p. 78 Not all of the vertebrae were preserved, but Osborn (1917) estimated that Ornitholestes had nine or ten cervical (neck) vertebrae, thirteen dorsal (back) vertebrae, four sacral (hip) vertebrae, and 39 to 44 caudal (tail) vertebrae.Osborn (1917), p. 735–736 Carpenter et al. (2005a) recorded that the specimen contained five sacral vertebrae.Carpenter et al. (2005a), p. 58 Ornitholestes was a short-bodied theropod, and this was reflected in the short front-to-back dimensions of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae.Carpenter et al. (2005a), p. 49, 69 Hand of the holotype, with the first finger restored on the right The forelimbs of Ornitholestes were relatively long, slightly under two-thirds the length of the hind legs.Ostrom (1969), p. 146; Paul (2002), p. 236 The humerus (upper arm bone) was heavily built, and somewhat longer than the radius and ulna (forearm bones).Osborn (1917), p. 738; Carpenter et al. (2005b), p. 45 Both the humerus and radius were straight-shafted.Carpenter et al. (2005a), p. 60, 62 The claws on digits I and II of the hand were about the same size.Senter (2006), p. 1030 Although the hand's third ungual (claw bone) was not preserved, extrapolation from the closest relatives of Ornitholestes indicates that it was probably shorter than the first two. Ornitholestes is often portrayed as a fast, long-legged theropod, but its lower limb bones were fairly short.Paul (1988a), p. 306 Osborn (1917) calculated that the, missing, tibia (shin bone) was only about 70.6% as long as the femur (thigh bone).Osborn (1917), p. 737 The metatarsals (foot bones) were spaced closely, but not fused together.Carpenter et al. (2005a), p. 67 As is typical of theropods, the feet were tridactyl (with three clawed weight-bearing toes).Osborn (1903), p. 463 John H. Ostrom (1969) noted that the claw of digit II (the innermost toe) was larger than those of digits III and IV, and suggested that this digit may have borne a modified sickle claw similar to that of Deinonychus.Ostrom (1969), p. 161 However, as both Ostrom (1969) and Paul (1988) noted, the poor preservation of digit II makes this hypothesis difficult to confirm.Ostrom (1969), p. 161; Paul (1988b), p. 6 Size comparison of Ornitholestes In his 1903 description, Osborn wrote that the length of Ornitholestes along \\"the skull and vertebral column as restored\\" was .Osborn (1903), p. 459 However, this reconstruction was inaccurate, being based in part on Othniel Charles Marsh's restoration of the basal sauropodomorph Anchisaurus, and the neck and trunk were both too elongated.Osborn (1917), p. 735; Paul (1988b), p. 3 David Norman (1985) and John Foster (2007) both estimated that Ornitholestes was about long.Norman (1985), p. 39; Foster (2007), p. 178 Gregory S. Paul's 1988 Predatory Dinosaurs of the World listed the length of Ornitholestes as approximately .Paul (1988a), p. 305 Paul (1988) and Foster (2007) both estimated that Ornitholestes weighed .Paul (1988a), p. 305; Foster (2007), p. 178 John A. Long and Peter Schouten (2008) suggested a slightly higher figure, .Long and Schouten (2008), p. 73 Discovery and naming Holotype specimen Ornitholestes was the first theropod to be discovered in the 1900s.Fastovsky and Weishampel (2005), p. 291 The holotype skeleton (AMNH 619) was excavated in July 1900 in the Bone Cabin Quarry in Wyoming by an American Museum of Natural History expedition by Peter C. Kaisen, Paul Miller and Frederic Brewster Loomis.Paul D. Brinkman, 2010, The Second Jurassic Dinosaur Rush: Museums & Paleontology in America at the Turn of the Twentieth Century. University of Chicago Press, 345 pp., It represents a partial skeleton with skull, including numerous elements of the vertebral column, the forelimbs, pelvis and hindlimbs. Henry Fairfield Osborn named and scientifically described the specimen in 1903.Osborn (1903), p. 459–464 The genus name Ornitholestes, initially suggested by Theodore Gill, means \\"bird robber\\" and is derived from the Greek ὄρνις/ornis, ornithos (\\"bird\\") and λῃστήσ/lestes (\\"robber\\").Osborn (1903), p. 459; Osborn (1917), p. 733 The species name (O. hermanni) honors Adam Hermann, the head preparator at the Museum, who directed the restoration and mounting of the skeleton. An incomplete hand (AMNH 587) was assigned to Ornitholestes by Osborn in his 1903 description of the genus.Osborn (1903), p. 459; Osborn (1917), p. 736 However, as Gregory S. Paul (1988) noted, the poor preservation of the corresponding elements in the type specimen made this association \\"tentative.\\"Paul (1988b), p. 3 In 2005, Kenneth Carpenter et al. described a new small theropod, Tanycolagreus, whose skeleton was found in Bone Cabin Quarry only a few hundred yards from AMNH 587.Carpenter et al. (2005b), p. 23, 39 Since AMNH 587 was virtually identical to the preserved hand of the Tanycolagreus type specimen, it is now considered to belong to that dinosaur and not to Ornitholestes.Carpenter et al. (2005b), p. 39 Following this reassignment, Phil Senter (2006) noted that \\"our knowledge of Ornitholestes can be drawn now only from the holotype.\\"Senter (2006), p. 1029 John Foster (2007) reported that some fragments from Dry Mesa Quarry may belong to Ornitholestes,Foster (2007), p. 78, 179 though these have not yet been described. In 1920 Charles Whitney Gilmore concluded that Ornitholestes was identical to Coelurus;Gilmore, C.W., 1920, \\"Osteology of the carnivorous Dinosauria in the United States National Museum, with special reference to the genera Antrodemus (Allosaurus) and Ceratosaurus\\", Bulletin U.S. National Museum CX: 1-154 in 1934 Oliver Perry Hay recognised only a difference at the species level, naming a Coelurus hermanni,Hay, O.P., 1930, Second Bibliography and Catalogue of the Fossil Vertebrata of North America. Carnegie Institution of Washington. 390(II): 1-1074 but in 1980 John Ostrom revived the genus.Ostrom (1980) Classification The infraorder Coelurosauria, coined in 1914 by Friedrich von Huene, was traditionally a taxonomic wastebasket into which all small theropods were placed.Paul (1988a), p. 188–189; Norman (1990), p. 280 Ornitholestes, due to its small size, was therefore generally classified as a coelurosaur.Glut (1997), p. 645 In 1986, Jacques Gauthier redefined this and several other paleontological terms in a more rigorous fashion, based on cladistic methods. Tetanurae was defined as modern birds and all theropods more closely related to modern birds than to ceratosaurs, while Coelurosauria now comprised all members of Tetanurae more closely related to modern birds than to carnosaurs.Holtz et al. (2004), p. 71 In 1988, Gregory S. Paul suggested that Ornitholestes was very similar in skull structure to Proceratosaurus, a Middle Jurassic theropod from England. He placed these two genera together in Ornitholestinae—a new subfamily under Allosauridae—and speculated that they were more closely related to the much larger Allosaurus than to other small theropods.Paul (1988a), p. 302; Paul (1988b), p. 3, 6 However, the classification of Ornitholestes and Proceratosaurus as allosaur relatives proved untenable (the latter has since proved to be a tyrannosauroid), and Paul eventually abandoned it.Paul (2010), p. 124 All published cladistic analyses have shown Ornitholestes to be a coelurosaur as defined by Gauthier. Some analysis have shown support for the hypothesis that it is the most primitive member of the group Maniraptora, though more thorough analyses have suggested it is more primitive than the Maniraptoriformes, and possibly a close relative of the \\"compsognathid\\" Juravenator starkii. The early 20th century mount of the holotype skeleton at the AMNH, which stands much the same today The following family tree illustrates a synthesis of the relationships of the major coelurosaurian groups based on various studies conducted in the 2010s.Hendrickx, C., Hartman, S.A., & Mateus, O. (2015). An Overview of Non- Avian Theropod Discoveries and Classification. PalArch’s Journal of Vertebrate Palaeontology, 12(1): 1-73. Paleobiology In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 20 foot bones referred to Ornitholestes were examined for signs of stress fracture, but none were found.Rothschild, B., Tanke, D. H., and Ford, T. L., 2001, Theropod stress fractures and tendon avulsions as a clue to activity: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, p. 331-336. =Forelimb function= A biomechanical study conducted by Phil Senter (2006) used articulated casts of the Ornitholestes type specimen's right forelimb to determine its range of motion.Senter (2006), p. 1029–1030 Senter found that the antebrachium (forearm) could swing freely within a 95° range.Senter (2006), p. 1030–1031 When flexed (bent inward) at the elbow joint to the maximum possible extent, the humerus (upper arm bone) and radius (a lower arm bone) formed a 53° angle. The ability of Ornitholestes to bend the forearm to an angle significantly more acute than 90° is characteristic of Maniraptoriformes, but absent in more primitive theropods such as Coelophysis and Allosaurus.Senter (2006), p. 1032 Even when fully extended (straightened) at the elbow, the forearm did not form a straight angle, falling short of this by 22°. Pronation (twisting to make the palmar side of the hand face downwards) of the forearm was impossible, because the radius and ulna lacked rolling surfaces, meaning the forearm was in a permanent state of supination. When Ornitholestes bent its elbows, this would cause the forearms to move inward, towards its midline.Senter (2006), p. 1030–1032 It may have used that ability to grasp prey with both hands simultaneously.Senter (2006), p. 1031 =Diet= This illustration by Charles R. Knight portrays Ornitholestes hunting Archaeopteryx, though they were not contemporaries Henry Fairfield Osborn, in his 1903 description of Ornitholestes, noted its large and conical front teeth, the \\"rapid grasping power\\" of its hand, and the \\"balancing power\\" of its tail; these he interpreted as adaptations to prey on contemporary birds. Osborn later repudiated this hypothesis, suggesting in 1917 that Ornitholestes presented the early stages of a transition from a carnivorous to a more herbivorous lifestyle, but not before Charles R. Knight had drawn an influential and widely published illustration of Ornitholestes chasing Archaeopteryx.Osborn (1917), p. 733–734; Glut (1997), p. 645 Knight's illustration, and others derived from it, continued to appear in dinosaur books aimed at a popular audience throughout the 20th century. David Norman (1985) conceded it was \\"just possible, though not very likely\\" that Ornitholestes might have caught and eaten primitive birds.Norman (1985), p. 39 Most recent authors, however, have instead suggested a diet of small terrestrial vertebrates. Mammals, lizards, frogs, salamanders, rhynchocephalians, and hatchling dinosaurs would all have been potential prey items.Norman (1985), p. 39; Paul (1988), p. 306; Foster (2007), p. 179; Long and Schouten (2008), p. 73 Gregory S. Paul (1988) thought that Ornitholestes might have used its conical front teeth to catch fish. Norman (1985) suggested that the robust skull and jaws might have allowed Ornitholestes to tackle \\"larger and more active prey\\" than other small theropods.Norman (1985), p. 42 In this vein, David Lambert (1993) speculated that Ornitholestes, if it was a pack hunter, might have been able to \\"take on ornithopods as big as a half-grown Camptosaurus.\\"Lambert (1993), p. 78 In 2007, John Foster, a specialist on the Morrison Formation, suggested the possibility of niche partitioning between Ornitholestes and its contemporary Coelurus, which was within the same size range.Foster (2007), p. 180 He theorized that big-eyed Ornitholestes might have been specialized for nocturnal hunting, while Coelurus may have focused on those prey species that were active during the day. Foster noted, however, that this hypothesis was largely speculative; a lack of preserved skull material from Coelurus makes it impossible to verify whether its eyes were proportionally smaller than those of Ornitholestes.Foster (2007), p. 180–181 Paul (1988) estimated that a endothermic Ornitholestes would have a daily dietary requirement of about of flesh.Paul (1988a), p. 404 =Feathers= Ornithologist Percy Lowe hypothesized in 1944 that Ornitholestes might have borne feathers.Witmer (1992), p. 444 However, this interpretation was largely disregarded for over half a century; most reconstructions of theropod dinosaurs, including Ornitholestes, portrayed them with reptile-like scaly skin. One of the few exceptions to this was Gregory S. Paul's Predatory Dinosaurs of the World (1988).Paul (1988a), p. 122–123, 211 Robert T. Bakker's The Dinosaur Heresies (1986) accurately predicted the presence of feathers on dromaeosaurids and contended that all dinosaurs were endothermic, yet did not incorporate feathers in its illustration of Ornitholestes.Bakker (1986), p. 99, 310 In 1996, the primitive coelurosaur Sinosauropteryx was discovered in China. The well-preserved fossil showed that this dinosaur bore a coat of rudimentary furlike feathers. As a result of this and other similar discoveries, most paleontologists now consider it likely that all coelurosaurs had insulating feathers of some kind, or were descended from ancestors that did.Chatterjee and Templin (2004), p. 277; Fastovsky and Weishampel (2005), p. 329–330; Currie (2005), p. 368 Based on its phylogenetic position, John Foster (2007) inferred that the feathers of Ornitholestes would probably have been more primitive than those of birds; they likely \\"would have covered the body except the legs in a short coat, perhaps with longer feathers lining the top of the skull or neck and the back edge of the forearms.\\"Foster (2007), p. 179 Assuming they were present, these feathers would have been used for insulation, and possibly also for brooding eggs.

He is known for his presenting on RTÉ shows such as Give or Take and enjoys frog spotting in his spare time,B'duff or Kells for new Hobbs, RTÉ programme 21 August 2013, The Anglo-Celt. Rip-Off Republic, Show Me the Money and 30 Things to do with your SSIA. Early career Hobbs worked for Zurich Life 1979 to 1991 and left his position as Marketing Manager to set up a fee-based financial planning company TIPS. In March 1993 Hobbs published a landmark report \\"Endowment Mortgages The Hometruth\\" which collapsed sales of endowment homeloans in Ireland by June 1993 after the banking and life insurance industry failed to deal with his critique. In 1995 Hobbs was made a non-executive director in the financial services firm Taylor Asset Management but resigned from it and TIPS in Jan 1996. In May 1996 after a two-month investigation, Hobbs lodged a complaint with the Irish regulator about the handling of two client files by Tony Taylor CEO of the Taylor Group. Tony Taylor fled Ireland and was located living under an alias in Eastbourne UK in 1999 by an investigator reporting to Hobbs. Taylor was extradited and pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud, forgery and destruction of documents for which he was sentenced to five years in prison. Hobbs himself was never implicated in any issues relating to company affairs and in 2007 he was exonerated by the Irish High Court and praised by the presiding judge for showing \\"efficiency and determination and for not standing idly\\" when he pursued Taylor's activities from 1995 to 1996. In 1996 he submitted a complaint to The Competition Authority alleging that the Government supported Irish Insurance Federation Remuneration Agreement was offensive to competition law since 1991, had engendered a culture of consensus decision making, restricted competition and prevented costs and commission disclosure to consumers. The complaint was upheld in 1998 forcing the Government to introduce statutory commission and charges disclosure. The Life industry was forced to reissue its product range to comply with the Insurance Act 2000. Hobbs acted in a voluntary capacity as a director and Finance spokesperson for The Consumers association of Ireland from 1993 to 2006. He has qualifications in accounting, finance and financial planning. Hobbs' complaint to the EU Taxation Commission that the Irish tax code was being adjusted to create competitive advantage to domestic Irish funds in breach of The Treaty of Rome, resulted in the Commission writing to Finance Minister McCreevy who adjusted the new gross roll-up tax regime to all OECD funds. When Minister McCreevy announced the SSIA savings scheme, Hobbs launched the Consumers Association of Ireland 'Savermark' standard that required banks to link deposit interest to the ECB base rate movements to prevent margins widening. Hobbs accused the Life Insurance industry of colluding to avoid the 'Savermark' pricing and called for a Competition Authority investigation. Television career He presented the RTÉ show Rip- Off Republic in 2005, a show preoccupied with artificially high development land prices, the perceived high personal taxes, corporate margins and cartels/monopolies in Ireland. (The term 'Ripoff Republic' was first used in an article in The Irish Independent in 2003 by consumer affairs journalist Eddie Lennon). In it Hobbs claimed, in a reference to land prices and inflated costs that \\"Ireland was eating its young\\". Prior to this, Hobbs presented the television show Show Me the Money, where he helped various people, from farmers to hairdressers, to improve their finances and which won two IFTA TV awards. He has also presented a three-part programme, 30 Things to do with your SSIA, in which he gives a humorous list of ideas for spending the money held in a Special Savings Incentive Account (SSIA). Notably he advised people against investing their SSIAs, along with borrowed bank money, in Irish Investment Property (RIPS) and explained investment in property PLCs as a better choice. He outlined Minsky's bubble theory and suggested the Irish market was at the latter steps of it. In Show Me the Money he repeatedly advised since 2004 that property prices in Ireland are only going down, and strongly advised against residential investment property purchase in Ireland. In 2007 Irish property prices started to reverse. An outspoken populist critic of the vested interests in Ireland, especially the producer groups who \\"control the country\\", Hobbs has often repeated that \\"There's one game in town: development.\\" He spoke out against Jumbo mortgages. During the run up to the 2007 Irish general election, Hobbs and his colleague Matt Cooper presented a political programme called Polls Apart on Irish TV station TV3, in which they interview the main Irish political party leaders about what they intend to do after the election, if they were to be elected into government. He co- presented RTÉ's The Consumer Show from 2010 to 2012. He quit the show in 2012 after concerns of being 'stifled'. He regularly appears in media debates on the nature of the Irish economic austerity policy heavily critical of the cross subsidisation of the public sector and inaction in dealing with Irish consumer insolvency. He presented My Civil War, a social history TV programme on the Irish Civil War with RTÉ's documentary unit. In November 2013 he presented an hour long pilot of 'The Give or Take Club' an experiment in social co-operation based in a rural town in a joint venture between Endemol, RTÉ, Independent Pictures and the presenter. Other work In 2004 he released Short Hands Long Pockets his first book as a fund raiser for The Jack & Jill Children's Foundation for whom he acts as patron since 2005. His second book LOOT! was published in 2006. Each book was a best seller. In March 2009, Hobbs released his third book, Debt Busters by Currach Press. From 2007 to 2010 he acted an editorial director of monthly magazine You & Your Money owned and published by Ashville Publications.He wrote weekly columns for The Daily Star, Sunday Independent and Sunday Business Post. In October 2009 he launched Energise – How to Survive and Prosper in the Coming Age of Scarcity, High Inflation and Peak Oil as an eBook from his website, all profits from which go to the Irish children's charity, The Jack & Jill Foundation. He is a frequent commentator and writer on social, economic and financial affairs on Irish TV, radio and newspapers. Hobbs campaigned against Government appropriation of private pension savings, encouraging savers to instruct pension trustees that they had no authority as custodians to meet Revenue Commissioners' demands, resulting in the Finance Act, which provided for a €380 fine for Trustees for every day the levy payment was delayed. Hobbs directed the letter campaign to urge then President McAleese to refer the Act to the Supreme Court on the basis that it was not taxing legislation but interference with property rights. The Irish President signed the Finance Act into law. The total taken in the pension levy to 2015 is estimated at €2bn. In a controversial Wall Street Journal article in October 2012, Hobbs described the Irish Government as a captive: \\"So while Time magazine and others eulogize the plucky leader of the Irish people, the truth is that Enda Kenny leads a Vichy government—captive externally to creditors that still insist on loading bank debt onto the sovereign, and internally to a tribe of insiders led by union godfathers in a deal that protects the government's own excessive pay and pensions while bankers lean over its shoulders to rewrite insolvency laws. This isn't just crony capitalism. It's crony democracy\\". Hobbs miscalculated the slump in demand in developed economies especially in Europe. Fearing that money printing operations would lead to an inflation break out, he advised mortgage holders with high debt to income to buy certainty and fix rates. He was wrong; after initially raising rates, the ECB was forced to cut them to historic lows. In 2007 as a non-executive director he helped launch Brendan Investments Plc, a ten-year collective investment in European property for smaller investors, after obtaining Central Bank approval as the first retail investment product to comply with the EU Prospectus Directive. The intake at under €13m fell short of expectations and although entering the stable German commercial property market, the vehicle was set back by early loses when its anchor tenant, Germany's largest retail group Arcandor went into liquidation during the banking crisis. He retired as a non-Executive Director 2015. Awards and posts held In 2005 Hobbs was awarded Honorary Patronage of the Trinity College, Dublin University Philosophical Society. He was appointed by the Irish Government as a Director of the National Consumer Agency in 2007 having served on its interim board since 2005. He resigned in 2009. In 2011 Hobbs was made an honorary life member of the University College Dublin Law Society for his contributions as a consumer advocate. In 2013 Hobbs helped set up Own Our Oil, a citizens advocacy group focused on overhauling Ireland's oil and gas licensing regime, and made a pre-Budget submission in July 2013 calling for the sale of licences to be treated like development land rezoning, and subject to Capital Gains Tax of 66% to recover economic rents to the Irish people. In March 2014 Hobbs launched Own Our Oil – the Fight for Ireland's Economic Freedom, a compilation of essays from a multi-discipline team of writers covering, planning, environment, taxation, strategy, industry, geology, and history, commencing a national public briefing campaign. During the Irish Water controversy Hobbs has called for the redrafting of Article 10 of the Irish Constitution to return the ownership of all natural resources to The Irish People from ownership by The State which it took in the 1937 Constitution, reducing the State role to a trustee required to act in the common good but justiciable through the Courts when in breach of its duties. This was a move designed to alienate the ability of the State to sell off natural resources, including water to preserve itself during future crises. Hobbs co-founded Renua a new political party in 2015 for which he acted as President resigning in 2016.

In the east Novotroitsk almost borders Orsk: the distance between the two cities is less than . Population: History The history of Novotroitsk goes to the beginning of the 20th century with a small farm in the wilderness. Near it, were the farms Akkermanovsky, Beloshapochny, and the village of Khabarnoye. Several families of peasants/immigrants from Ukraine settled near Silnova and named their settlement Novotroitsk. The 1930s, large industrial buildings were created. Before Novotroitsk was founded, the villagers heard news of the construction of factories in Orsk, and the finding of minerals. Fersman, a well-known academician, spoke in his writings of the fabulous and wealthy Orsk region, and called Orsk-Khalilovsk area a \\"true gem of the Urals.\\" In the fall of 1929, geologist I. L. Rudnitsky opened the Khalilovsky field hematites. Khalilovsk ore was rare in its composition: it contains chromium, nickel, titanium, and manganese. Industrial tests confirmed its quality. In June 1931, the Government adopted a decision to start construction on the Khalilovsk ores and Karaganda coal, both to be big metallurgical plants. The construction schedule which was set to start building the Khalilovo metallurgical plant was scheduled for 1936. During this period, in the village of Novotroitsk, the first construction builders arrived. In 1935, construction was suspended and only in the spring of 1939 in the Resolution XVIII of Congress it had specifically determined: \\"... To begin construction of new metallurgical plants (at Khalilovsk Bakalskoye and ores). In the summer of 1939 board Commissariat of the steel industry adopted a resolution, which says: \\"Accept construction Khalilovo smelter selected Novotroitsky District...\\". The modern town was founded on April 13, 1945, as a result of the merger of the villages of Novo-Troitsk and Akkermanovka of Novotroitsky District. The area of Novotroitsk is . Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with nine rural localities, incorporated as the Town of Novotroitsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #1370/276-IV-OZ As a municipal division, the Town of Novotroitsk is incorporated as Novotroitsk Urban Okrug.Law #2367/495-IV-OZ Economy The town is located in the Orsk-Khalilovo industrial region of the southern Urals. The center of ferrous metallurgy in the area, the town has a major integrated iron and steel plant that was developed in the 1950s on the basis of nearby iron-ore deposits. Chemical production is also of importance to the region. The town has a well-developed industry, and has twenty large and medium-sized enterprises which are employing more than 30,000 people. The town's economy largely determines the industry, accounting for 95.8% of total manufactured goods and services. Manufacturing firms in 2009 were shipped their own production of clean activities amounting to 54.24 billion rubles. The largest share in the volume of products shipped by type of activity \\"Manufacturing\\" fell on the organization of the metallurgical complex. - 75.3%, in the second position - processing of waste and scrap. - 12.7%, on the third - the production of foodstuffs, including beverages - 3.8%. The main enterprise is the Iron and Steel Works JSC \\"Ural Steel\\". The development of the town, its infrastructure is still determined by the state JSC \\"Ural Steel\\", which accounts for almost 90% of the total industrial output. The plant is part of the eight largest steel companies in Russia, and the rating of 200 subsidiaries in terms of sales takes 23rd place. The list of its products is very extensive; it is the only enterprise in the world that produces natural-casting alloy, chrome- nickel iron ore from its own fields. Small business has become an integral part of modern market economic system. The town recorded 660 small enterprises and about 3000 entrepreneurs without legal entity. As the number of employees - more than 9000 people. Today, every fifth inhabitant of the city lives off of the revenue from small businesses. Culture There are 27 general educational institutions, including gymnasiums and lyceums, totalling 15,200 enrolled students. There are two colleges, three professional colleges; the Novotroitsk branch of the International Institute of Economics and Law, Novotroitsky branch of the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys, and an educational and consulting center called the Magnitogorsk State Technical University, a branch of Moscow State Open University. Within the town there are six hospitals, with the number of hospital beds around 1,500 each, and 5 clinics with the capacity for more than 3,460 visits per shift.

In Novotroitsk, there is also a museum and exhibition complex. At the museum there are two art studios, courses in Arabic, literature and culture. The most notable buildings are the municipal cultural institution \\"Palace of Culture Industry\\", built about 50 years ago, the temple of Peter and Paul, built 90 years ago, which is a mosque. A monument landmark - the monument to \\"live forever\\", is a monument to soldiers-internationalists. Secondary school № 23 is named after the 850 anniversary of Moscow, a monument to Mary Koretskaya in its place, for the shooting outside the settlement Khabarny. It has an effective movie theater called \\"Steel\\". General Plan of development provides for construction of residential houses in the southwest of the town. The town has five tram routes.

IBM's HACMP product was first shipped in 1991 and is now in its 20th release - PowerHA SystemMirror for AIX 7.1. PowerHA can run on up to 32 computers or nodes, each of which is either actively running an application (active) or waiting to take over when another node fails (passive). Data on file systems can be shared between systems in the cluster. PowerHA relies heavily on IBM's Reliable Scalable Cluster Technology (RSCT). PowerHA is an RSCT aware client. RSCT is distributed with AIX. RSCT includes a daemon called group services that coordinates the response to events of interest to the cluster (for example, an interface or a node fails, or an administrator makes a change to the cluster configuration). Up until PowerHA V6.1, RSCT also monitored cluster nodes, networks and network adapters for failures using the topology services daemon (topsvcs). In the current release (V7.1), RSCT provides coordinate response between nodes, but monitoring and communication are provided by the Cluster Aware AIX (CAA) infrastructure. The 7.1 release of PowerHA relies heavily on CAA, a clustering infrastructure built into the operating system and exploited by RSCT and PowerHA. CAA provides the monitoring and communication infrastructure for PowerHA and other clustering solutions on AIX, as well as cluster-wide event notification using the Autonomic Health Advisor File System (AHAFS) and cluster-aware AIX commands with clcmd.

Initially, these were adaptations of various movies. In the late 1980s and continuing through to the mid-1990s, however, a series of original stories were also published. After a hiatus in 1996, the Bond comic book publishing license was picked up again and made a revival debut in 2015. The comics were published by various past and present companies including DC Comics, Marvel, Eclipse Comics, Dark Horse and Dynamite Entertainment. English publicationsAdaptations= The first James Bond comic book appeared in December 1962 - an adaptation of the first Bond film Dr. No. Originally published by Classics Illustrated in the United Kingdom, it was later reprinted in the United States by DC Comics as part of its Showcase anthology series in January 1963. The next James Bond comic book did not appear for nearly 20 years, when Marvel Comics published a two-issue adaptation of the 1981 film For Your Eyes Only (which was also published in a single-issue magazine edition and a paperback release). Marvel later adapted the 1983 film Octopussy in magazine format. In 1989 comic books featuring Bond began to appear on a semi-regular basis for a few years, starting with an adaptation of Licence to Kill published in 1989 by Acme Press/Eclipse Comics and illustrated by Mike Grell, which was published in both trade paperback and hardcover edition. Grell would go on to write the miniseries Permission to Die, the first James Bond comic book storyline not adapted from a previous work, which was published over a two-year period by Acme/Eclipse. In 1995, Topps Comics obtained the rights to publish an adaptation of the new Bond film, GoldenEye, which was announced as a three-issue miniseries. The second issue of the miniseries was delayed due to concerns over the cover art for the issue, and ultimately Topps chose to discontinue publishing the adaptation, and also cancelled plans for an ongoing James Bond comic book series. A graphic novel adaptation of Charlie Higson's first Young Bond novel SilverFin was released in the UK on October 2, 2008. The book is illustrated by Kev Walker. Dynamite Entertainment's senior editor Joseph Rybandt, hinted that a graphic novel adaptation of Fleming's first Bond thriller, Casino Royale is in the pipeline, while they work on an original monthly series, but it wasn't officially announced until July 2016 with Van Jensen adapting the novel closely into comic book format and Matthew Southworth illustrating it, aiming for a November release later that year. However, Southworth left the project due to \\"creative differences\\", and was replaced with Dennis Calero as the artist, while the cover artwork is provided with by Fay Dalton. After months in the pipeline, Dynamite released the graphic novel on 11 April 2018. =Original series=Dark Horse Comics In 1992, Dark Horse Comics obtained the rights to produce James Bond comics (acquired via the UK publisher Acme Comics, formerly known as Acme Press)Curson, Natasha. \\"Acme – take two Earthquake Pills and exit over cliff...,\\" Natasha Curson blog (August 18, 2010). and issued a number of limited series and stand-alone stories that began with Serpent's Tooth, a three-issue miniseries published over the course of two years, with an original story written by Doug Moench and illustrated by Paul Gulacy. The second miniseries made of supposedly four issues debuted in 1993, called A Silent Armageddon was delivered by Simon Jowett and John M. Burns, but only two of the planned four issues were released. The miniseries, to this day, remains incomplete in its publication. Light of My Death was the third Bond story to be published by Dark Horse Comics which, unlike its predecessors, was released alongside different intellectual property franchise titles in four issues, a period piece set in the 1960s written by Das Petrou and illustrated by John Watkiss, including a reprisal appearance of Tatiana Romanova from From Russia with Love. Following the installment was a Dark Horse/Acme two-issue miniseries Shattered Helix in 1994, with Jowett returning to pen the story, and the art receiving its illustration by David Jackson and David Lloyd. The next one followed in the footsteps of Light of My Death in its publication vein, released alongside an unrelated franchise title in Dark Horse Comics #25, called Minute of Midnight from Doug Moench and Russ Heath, which was supposed to be setting up a major story arc for a planned ongoing series on Dark Horse's behalf before their rights on the Bond comics were expired. The last miniseries to be published by Dark Horse/Acme was The Quasimodo Gambit in three issues, an original experience written by Don McGregor, who completed scripting it six years prior to its publication, and illustrated by Gary Caldwell, completing its run in May 1995. The list of comics published by Dark Horse (many with Acme Comics' packaging) includes: *Serpent's Tooth (1992-1993) by Doug Moench and Paul Gulacy *A Silent Armageddon (1993, incomplete) by Simon Jowett and John M. Burns *Light of My Death (1993, appearing in Dark Horse Comics #8, #9, #10, #11) by Das Petrou and John Watkiss *Shattered Helix (1994) by Simon Jowett, David Jackson and David Lloyd *Minute of Midnight (1994, appearing in Dark Horse Comics #25) by Doug Moench and Russ Heath *The Quasimodo Gambit (1995) by Don McGregor and Gary Caldwell Dynamite Entertainment In October 2014, Dynamite Entertainment acquired the license from Ian Fleming Publications to produce and publish a series of comic books concentrating on Fleming's literary hero in two different timelines. One will be a period piece, expanding on his days prior to the events of Casino Royale with original stories. The other, by Warren Ellis and Jason Masters with a contemporary setting, has been published as a monthly comic since November 2015. The first six-issue story arc was titled Vargr, followed by a second arc titled Eidolon. The monthly ongoing series, as revealed in October 2016, was taken over by writer Benjamin Percy. The title was announced as Black Box, written by Percy and illustrated by Rapha Lobosco. On 18 June 2018, James Bond Origin was officially unveiled by Dynamite as a long-lasting period-piece series, of which the first issue will be making its debut in September later in the year, with the first story arc being delivered by Jeff Parker and Bob Q. It focuses on a seventeen year old Bond at the height of World War II as he bursts on his way out fighting to survive, thus leading him to make a decision that will change his life forever. Additional standalone series are also in the pipeline, of which the first in arrival was unveiled as Hammerhead, a six-issue miniseries, bringing new creators Andy Diggle as the writer and Luca Casalanguida as the artist on board, debuting in October 2016. In February 2017, Dynamite unveiled another standalone installment called Service by creators Kieron Gillen and Antonio Fuso, presenting a 48-page comic book set to come out in May 2017. On 17 April 2017, a new miniseries was announced with Diggle and Casalanguida, along with the rest of the crew returning from Hammerhead in a follow-up, called Kill Chain, offering many variant covers for the first issue, set to debut in the month of July. In August 2017, Dynamite unveiled yet another one-shot Bond comic to be brought by writer and illustrator Ibrahim Moustafa, titled Solstice, set for a November 2017 release. On 4 October 2017, Dynamite announced a new six-issue miniseries entitled The Body written by Ales Kot, debuting in January 2018. Spin-off miniseries has also been announced in October 2016 with the role of the protagonist given to Bond's known CIA ally, Felix Leiter, starring in his own first ever adventure and solo ride, simply called Felix Leiter, written by James Robinson and illustrated by Aaron Campbell, set to come out sometime in January 2017. On 23 May 2017, another spin-off was announced, Moneypenny, which centers on M's secretary and security agent, Moneypenny herself. On 21 November 2017, a third spin-off was announced aimed for February 2018 release, a 40-page one-shot comic book centered on M himself, exploring his backstory as well as dealing with his past that comes back to haunt him, delivered by creators Declan Shalvey and P.J. Holden.

Holden Swedish publications Swedish comic book publisher Semic Press started a James Bond comic book magazine in 1965, which was simultaneously published in Norwegian, Danish and Finnish editions. Originally, the contents were derived from the James Bond newspaper strips; translated and edited to fit the comic book format. As time passed the archive of newspaper strip stories was soon depleted and reprinted over and over again. Semic editors therefore decided to acquire rights to produce their own Bond stories directly for the comic book. The first James Bond story produced by Semic was published in Swedish James Bond #1/1982 (Note: Scandinavian comic magazines usually restart the numbering each year). It was called \\"Den gyllene triangeln\\" (\\"The Golden Triangle\\"), drawn by Escolano and written by Norwegians Terje Nordberg and Eirik Ildahl under the pseudonym Johann Vlaanderen. About half a dozen new stories were produced each year, in black/white and around 24 pages. Main artists were Sarompas, Josep Gual and Manuel Carmona. Main writers were Sverre Årnes, Jack Sutter and Bill Harrington. Between 1982 and 1991, Semic produced 42 comic magazine stories and five album (graphic novel) stories, of which 3 were based on Bond movies. Eight of these were also published in the Netherlands by Semic Press. Attempts were made to sell the Semic Bond stories to other European countries (Spain and Germany for example) but this was limited to only a few episodes. The episode \\"Operation: Blücher\\" from James Bond #12/1984 was written by Norwegian Sverre Årnes and centered on a sunken Nazi ship outside Norway. The plot of this story (minus James Bond) was later adapted into the script for the movie Blücher, released in 1988.

The surface of the waters are a deep green during the month of August and September due to the abundance of algae in the water. The lake is in danger of eutrophication due to human activities. Park management forbids swimming in the lake, walking domestic animals near it, straying from the wooden boardwalk for sight-seers, and throwing stones into the lake.  History  Pink Lake is named after a family of Irish settlers who in 1826 cleared a farm in the area. It used to be a salt water lake as a part of the oceans. It took over 3000 years for the lake to turn from salt water to fresh water (generally a lake of this size shouldn't take over a few decades) and as a result some of the salt water fishes adapted to fresh water.  Properties  Due to the meromictic properties of Pink Lake there are ancient forms of bacteria which use sulfur instead of oxygen to perform photosynthesis. These bacteria form a layer about 7 metres from the bottom to avoid the oxygenated water and maximize sunlight exposure. Pink Lake also has a desalinized variant of the three-spined stickleback fish. In 2006, research was in progress to identify the patterns of atmospheric conditions over the past 10,000 years by examining the annual deposits of sediment in Pink Lake. Popular culture Pink Lake plays a symbolic role in the novel Wash This Blood Clean From My Hand by Fred Vargas.

It is administratively part of Aitutaki, but it does not belong to any district or tapere of Aitutaki. It is, however, part of Arutanga-Reureu-Nikaupara Constituency.  Geographic description  Map of Manuae Manuae is a true atoll sitting on the peak of a submerged volcano which descends over 4000 meters to the ocean bed. It comprises two horseshoe-shaped islets, Manuae to the west and Te Au O Tu to the east, with a total area of 6 km2 on either side of a lagoon about 7 km x 4 km. Manuae has an area of 2.1 km2, while Te Au O Tu's is 3.9 km2. The lagoon is 13 km2 in size, shallow and subject to large shifting sand banks. A coral reef surrounds the atoll, and there is no passage through the reef. The island is a marine park and is an important breeding ground for seabirds and marine turtles in the Central Pacific. The offshore waters of Manuae are good fishing grounds.  History  Captain James Cook sighted Manuae on 23 September 1773, the first of the Cook Islands he voyaged to. Initially he named it Sandwich Island but changed it to Hervey Island in honor of Augustus Hervey, 3rd Earl of Bristol, then a Lord of the Admiralty. Capt. Cook later decided to give the name of \\"Sandwich Islands\\" to the Hawaiian Islands instead. This name was later corrupted to Hervey's Island, or Hervey's Isle, and later applied to the entire southern group, as the Hervey Islands. This name remained popular until 1824 when the islands were renamed the Cook Islands by the Russian cartographer von Krusenstern, in honor of Capt. Cook who had died in 1779. In April/May 1965 the population briefly increased to 120 when the island was visited by six expeditions (from Australia, N.Z., Japan, U.K., U.S.A. and U.S.S.R.) to observe the total solar eclipse of 30 May 1965. Norwegian author Erlend Loe writes humorously about an expedition to Manuae in his 1999 novel \\"L\\". In April 2020 the Cook Islands National Environment Service advertised for two caretakers to live on the island for a year.  Economy and improvements  The island once supported a small copra industry with a settlement established next to the small reef passage less than one kilometer northeast of Turakino, the westernmost point of the atoll. The passage, at the sea entrance, is less than 4 metres wide and in a swell is exceedingly dangerous without local knowledge. The island has an airfield (a dirt airstrip barely visible) that has been out of use for several years. Fishermen from Aitutaki occasionally organise trips to Manuae. All regulations applicable to Aitutaki, apply to Manuae as well.  Demography  The population peaked with 32 at the 1956 census, but twenty years later the island was abandoned.

For his 14 surgical procedures towards that goal, he held a world record for \\"most permanent transformations to look like an animal.\\" \\"Stalking Cat\\" was his chosen name.  Biography  Avner was born in Flint, Michigan, and grew up in Suttons Bay, Michigan. As an adult, he joined the Navy as a sonar technician. He left his Navy post around 1981. He then began working as a computer programmer and technician in San Diego, California. In the early 1980s, guided by his personal vision and feelings of affinity for the tigress, Stalking Cat began tattooing and surgically modifying his face. In interviews, he repeatedly stated that he chose to alter his physical appearance in accordance with what he believed was an ancient Wyandot tradition; however, this was his personal belief, not traditional practice. He also told people he grew up in a tribe and had been told to change his form to that of a tiger by a medicine man. While living in San Diego, he met Tess Calhoun at a furry convention. Over several years, he formed a close friendship with Calhoun and her husband, Rick Weiss. In 2005, Weiss' job with Boeing required the couple to move to Washington, and they asked Stalking Cat, then aged 47, to join them. The trio moved to Freeland, Washington, on Whidbey Island, where Stalking Cat helped fix up their house. He stood out in the small town, and the local newspapers occasionally ran articles on him. One article referred to him as a \\"cigarette-smoking, out-of- work, registered Republican who owns firearms and left California because he believes it's become a communist state\\". Calhoun said that he was \\"living in a family for really the first time\\" and that \\"it takes some adjusting\\". Stalking Cat, Calhoun, and Weiss were active in the furry community, both online and at conventions. They held monthly gatherings for members of the furry community at their home. Stalking Cat became well known in the furry community and has a biography on WikiFur. He had financial troubles, and in August 2007, he posted publicly on his online journal that he needed a new place to live. Calhoun posted that she and her husband simply could not afford to support him anymore. She also posted that they would be throwing him a send-off party. Death In September 2007, at age 49, Stalking Cat moved to Tonopah, Nevada. On November 5, 2012, he died alone in his garage. He was 54 years old. News of the death became public one week later. In an online post, BMEzine founder Shannon Larratt wrote that his death was a suicide.  Body modifications  Description of modifications = Many of Stalking Cat's body modifications were performed by Arizona-based artist Steve Haworth. The first artist to begin the extensive tattoo work on Stalking Cat's face was Larry Hanks in San Diego, California, who started the work in 1985.http://westcoastinkmag.com/larry-hanks/ He had over 14 modifications, including: * Extensive tattooing, including facial tattooing * Facial subdermal implants to change the shape of his brow, forehead, and the bridge of his nose * Flattening his nose, via septum relocation * Silicone injection in his lips, cheeks, chin, and other parts of his face * Bifurcating (splitting) his upper lip * Filing and capping his teeth * Surgically shaping his ears, making his ears pointed and his earlobes elongated * Surgical hairline modification * Piercing his upper lip and transdermal implants on his forehead, to facilitate wearing whiskers * Wearing green contact lenses with slit irises * Wearing a robotic tail Future modification plans included a plan for implants on top of his head, for mounting tiger-like ears. = Medical ethics concerns = Glenn McGee, director of the Center for Bioethics at Albany Medical College in New York, said: \\"Cosmetic surgery is a practice based on informed consent that needs to balance the risks with the benefits. It is possible to have a coherent view that is nonetheless detrimental to one's well-being. This is a patient who's being harmed by medicine in the interest of his tradition.\\"  See also  * Tom Leppard * Katzen * Lucky Diamond Rich * The Enigma * The Lizardman (performer)  References  External links  *Stalking Cat, WikiFur biography *Livejournal, online journal *Stalking Cat, official site *Audio interview with Stalking Cat Category:1958 births Category:2012 deaths Category:People known for their body modification Category:Suicides in Nevada Category:Male suicides Category:Computer programmers who committed suicide Category:Furry fandom people Category:People known for being heavily tattooed Category:People from Flint, Michigan Category:People from Leelanau County, Michigan Category:People from Tonopah, Nevada Category:Military personnel from Michigan ","title":"Stalking Cat"},{"id":"2468667","text":"Naogaon ( Nôogã) is a city and district headquarter of Naogaon District in northern Bangladesh.

They operate by using high availability software to harness redundant computers in groups or clusters that provide continued service when system components fail. Without clustering, if a server running a particular application crashes, the application will be unavailable until the crashed server is fixed. HA clustering remedies this situation by detecting hardware/software faults, and immediately restarting the application on another system without requiring administrative intervention, a process known as failover. As part of this process, clustering software may configure the node before starting the application on it. For example, appropriate file systems may need to be imported and mounted, network hardware may have to be configured, and some supporting applications may need to be running as well.van Vugt, Sander (2014), Pro Linux High Availability Clustering, p.3, Apress, HA clusters are often used for critical databases, file sharing on a network, business applications, and customer services such as electronic commerce websites. HA cluster implementations attempt to build redundancy into a cluster to eliminate single points of failure, including multiple network connections and data storage which is redundantly connected via storage area networks. HA clusters usually use a heartbeat private network connection which is used to monitor the health and status of each node in the cluster. One subtle but serious condition all clustering software must be able to handle is split-brain, which occurs when all of the private links go down simultaneously, but the cluster nodes are still running. If that happens, each node in the cluster may mistakenly decide that every other node has gone down and attempt to start services that other nodes are still running. Having duplicate instances of services may cause data corruption on the shared storage. HA clusters often also use quorum witness storage (local or cloud) to avoid this scenario. A witness device cannot be shared between two halves of a split cluster, so in the event that all cluster members cannot communicate with each other (e.g., failed heartbeat), if a member cannot access the witness, it cannot become active. Application design requirements Not every application can run in a high-availability cluster environment, and the necessary design decisions need to be made early in the software design phase. In order to run in a high-availability cluster environment, an application must satisfy at least the following technical requirements, the last two of which are critical to its reliable function in a cluster, and are the most difficult to satisfy fully: * There must be a relatively easy way to start, stop, force-stop, and check the status of the application. In practical terms, this means the application must have a command line interface or scripts to control the application, including support for multiple instances of the application. * The application must be able to use shared storage (NAS/SAN). * Most importantly, the application must store as much of its state on non- volatile shared storage as possible. Equally important is the ability to restart on another node at the last state before failure using the saved state from the shared storage. * The application must not corrupt data if it crashes, or restarts from the saved state. * A number of these constraints can be minimized through the use of virtual server environments, wherein the hypervisor itself is cluster-aware and provides seamless migration of virtual machines (including running memory state) between physical hosts -- see Microsoft Server 2012 and 2016 Failover Clusters. ** A key difference between this approach and running cluster-aware applications is that the latter can deal with server application crashes and support live \\"rolling\\" software upgrades while maintaining client access to the service (e.g. database), by having one instance provide service while another is being upgraded or repaired. This requires the cluster instances to communicate, flush caches and coordinate file access during hand-off. Node configurations 2 node High Availability Cluster network diagram The most common size for an HA cluster is a two-node cluster, since that is the minimum required to provide redundancy, but many clusters consist of many more, sometimes dozens of nodes. The attached diagram is a good overview of a classic HA cluster, with the caveat that it does not make any mention of quorum/witness functionality (see above). Such configurations can sometimes be categorized into one of the following models: * Active/active — Traffic intended for the failed node is either passed onto an existing node or load balanced across the remaining nodes. This is usually only possible when the nodes use a homogeneous software configuration. * Active/passive — Provides a fully redundant instance of each node, which is only brought online when its associated primary node fails. This configuration typically requires the most extra hardware. * N+1 — Provides a single extra node that is brought online to take over the role of the node that has failed. In the case of heterogeneous software configuration on each primary node, the extra node must be universally capable of assuming any of the roles of the primary nodes it is responsible for. This normally refers to clusters that have multiple services running simultaneously; in the single service case, this degenerates to active/passive. * N+M — In cases where a single cluster is managing many services, having only one dedicated failover node might not offer sufficient redundancy. In such cases, more than one (M) standby servers are included and available. The number of standby servers is a tradeoff between cost and reliability requirements. * N-to-1 — Allows the failover standby node to become the active one temporarily, until the original node can be restored or brought back online, at which point the services or instances must be failed-back to it in order to restore high availability. * N-to-N — A combination of active/active and N+M clusters, N to N clusters redistribute the services, instances or connections from the failed node among the remaining active nodes, thus eliminating (as with active/active) the need for a 'standby' node, but introducing a need for extra capacity on all active nodes. The terms logical host or cluster logical host is used to describe the network address that is used to access services provided by the cluster. This logical host identity is not tied to a single cluster node. It is actually a network address/hostname that is linked with the service(s) provided by the cluster. If a cluster node with a running database goes down, the database will be restarted on another cluster node.  Node reliability  HA clusters usually use all available techniques to make the individual systems and shared infrastructure as reliable as possible. These include: * Disk mirroring (or Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks --RAID) so that failure of internal disks does not result in system crashes. The Distributed Replicated Block Device is one example. * Redundant network connections so that single cable, switch, or network interface failures do not result in network outages. * Redundant storage area network (SAN) connections so that single cable, switch, or interface failures do not lead to loss of connectivity to the storage (this would violate shared nothing architecture). * Redundant electrical power inputs on different circuits, usually both or all protected by uninterruptible power supply units, and redundant power supply units, so that single power feed, cable, UPS, or power supply failures do not lead to loss of power to the system. These features help minimize the chances that the clustering failover between systems will be required. In such a failover, the service provided is unavailable for at least a little while, so measures to avoid failover are preferred. Failover strategies Systems that handle failures in distributed computing have different strategies to cure a failure. For instance, the Apache Cassandra API Hector defines three ways to configure a failover: * Fail Fast, scripted as \\"FAIL_FAST\\", means that the attempt to cure the failure fails if the first node cannot be reached. * On Fail, Try One - Next Available, scripted as \\"ON_FAIL_TRY_ONE_NEXT_AVAILABLE\\", means that the system tries one host, the most accessible or available, before giving up. * On Fail, Try All, scripted as \\"ON_FAIL_TRY_ALL_AVAILABLE\\", means that the system tries all existing, available nodes before giving up.

He was a member of the Republican Party. Biography Hall was born in Dodge City and graduated from Dodge City High School where his participation on the debate team and his academic achievements earned him a scholarship to the University of Southern California. While attending U.S.C., he was a member of the International Debating Team, finished his B.A. degree in 1938, stayed on and earned his law degree. He married Leadell Schneider and they had one child. Career During World War II, Hall enlisted and was rejected when he failed to pass his physical. From 1942 to 1944, he served as an assistant director of the Combined Production and Resources Board, coordinating production planning with Britain and Canada, and based in Washington. Hall established his law practice in Topeka and Dodge City and served as the Ford County attorney from 1947 to 1949. Elected Lieutenant Governor of Kansas, he served from 1951 to 1955. Elected in 1954, Hall was sworn into the governorship on January 10, 1955. During his tenure, the director of the state purchasing agency was fired, a high school aid law was authorized, a water resource commission was organized, and a \\"right to work\\" bill was vetoed. Hall resigned to become a justice of Kansas Supreme Court in 1957 after being defeated in the primary for re- election to office, in what is known as the \\"triple-play of 1956\\". Warren Shaw defeated Hall in the Republican primary for governor, and Shaw lost the subsequent Gubernatorial general election to Democrat George Docking. Sitting Chief Justice Bill Smitha strong supporter of Hallwas seriously ill and contemplating a retirement from his position as Chief Justice; however, he was concerned that if he retired after Docking took office in January 1957, Docking would appoint a Democrat as Chief Justice. Smith, Hall, and Lieutenant Governor John McCuish devised a plan to prevent this from happening. Chief Justice Smith resigned effective January 3, 1957. Smith's resignation was quickly followed by Governor Hall's resignation also effective on January 3, 1957. As a result of Hall's resignation, Lieutenant Governor McCuish was sworn in as Kansas Governor. On the same day Walter G. Thiele became Chief Justice and Hall replaced Thiel as an associate justice of the Kansas Supreme Court. Thiel left the court the same day Docking became governor and Jay S. Parker replaced Thiel as Chief Justice. http://www.kscourts.org/kansas- courts/general-information/justice-listing.asp Hall served on the Supreme Court bench until April 7, 1958 when he resigned to again run for the governorship where he lost the primary. Defeated in his bid, he retired from politics and moved to California where he became an executive in the management control of the Aerojet General Corporation. He returned later to Dodge City and resumed his law practice. Death and legacy He was a member of the Methodist Church and a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity and elected to a term on the Phi Kappa Tau National Council in 1956. Hall died at Shawnee and is interred at Maple Grove Cemetery in Dodge City.

He is considered one of Romania's greatest national heroes. Since the 19th-century Michael was seen by nationalists as a symbol of Romanian unity, as under his reign was the first time when all principalities inhabited by Romanians were under the same ruler. His rule over Wallachia began in the autumn of 1593. Two years later, war with the Ottomans began, a conflict in which the Prince fought the Battle of Călugăreni, considered one of the most important battles of his reign. Although the Wallachians emerged victorious from the battle, Michael was forced to retreat with his troops and wait for aid from his allies, Prince Sigismund Báthory of Transylvania and Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. The war continued until a peace finally emerged in January 1597, but this lasted for only a year and a half. Peace was again reached in late 1599, when Michael was unable to continue the war due to lack of support from his allies. In 1599, Michael won the Battle of Șelimbăr and soon entered Alba Iulia, becoming the imperial governor (i.e. de facto ruler) of Transylvania. A few months later, Michael's troops invaded Moldavia and reached its capital, Iaşi. The Moldavian leader Ieremia Movilă fled to Poland and Michael was declared Prince of Moldavia. Michael kept the control of all three provinces for less than a year before the nobles of Transylvania and certain boyars in Moldavia and Wallachia rose against him in a series of revolts. Thereafter, Michael allied with the Imperial General Giorgio Basta and defeated an uprising of the Hungarian nobility at Gurăslău in Transylvania. Immediately after this victory, Rudolf ordered the assassination of Michael, an action carried out on 9 August 1601 by Basta's men. Early life Michael was born under the family name of Pătraşcu. In 1601, during a stay in Prague, he was portrayed by the painter Aegidius Sadeler, who mentioned on the portrait the words aetatis XLIII (\\"in the 43rd year of life\\"), which indicates 1558 as the year of Michael's birth. Very little is known about his childhood and early years as an adult. He is argued by most historians to have been the illegitimate son of Wallachian Prince Pătraşcu cel Bun (Pătrașcu the Good),Giurescu, p. 180.; Iorga. of the Drăculeşti branch of the House of Basarab, while others believe he merely invented his descent in order to justify his rule.Panaitescu. His mother was , a member of the Kantakouzenoi, a noble family present in Wallachia and Moldavia, and allegedly descended from the Byzantine Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos. Michael's political rise was quite spectacular, as he became the Ban of Mehedinţi in 1588, stolnic at the court of Mihnea Turcitul by the end of 1588, and Ban of Craiova in 1593 – during the rule of Alexandru cel Rău. The latter had him swear before 12 boyars that he was not of princely descent.According to the 18th-century chronicle of Radu Popescu. Still, in May 1593 conflict did break out between Alexandru and Michael, who was forced to flee to Transylvania. He was accompanied by his half-brother Radu Florescu, Radu Buzescu and several other supporters. After spending two weeks at the court of Sigismund Báthory, he left for Constantinople, where with help from his cousin Andronikos Kantakouzenos (the eldest son of Michael \\"Şeytanoğlu\\" Kantakouzenos) and Patriarch Jeremiah II he negotiated Ottoman support for his accession to the Wallachian throne. He was supported by the English ambassador in the Ottoman capital, Edward Barton, and aided by a loan of 200,000 florins. Michael was invested Prince by Sultan Murad III in September 1593 and started his effective rule on 11 October.Giurescu, p. 182. He was considered a traitor as he had been forced to purchase the title of Domnitor (ruler).  Wallachia  Engraving of Michael the Brave Not long after Michael became Prince of Wallachia, he turned against the Ottoman Empire. The next year he joined the Christian alliance of European powers formed by Pope Clement VIII against the Turks, and signed treaties with his neighbours: Sigismund Báthory of Transylvania, Aaron the Tyrant of Moldavia and the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II (see Holy League of Pope Clement VIII). He started a campaign against the Turks in the autumn of 1594, conquering several citadels near the Danube, including Giurgiu, Brăila, Hârşova, and Silistra, while his Moldavian allies defeated the Turks in Iaşi and other parts of Moldavia.Giurescu, p. 183. Mihai continued his attacks deep within the Ottoman Empire, taking the forts of Nicopolis, Ribnic, and ChiliaColn, Emporungen so sich in Konigereich Ungarn, auch in Siebenburgen Moldau, in der der bergischen Walachay und anderen Oerten zugetragen haben, 1596 and even reaching as far as Adrianople.Marco Venier, correspondence with the Doge of Venice, 16 July 1595 In 1595, Sigismund Báthory staged an elaborate plot and had Aaron the Tyrant, voivode of Moldavia, removed from power.C. Rezachevici – \\"Legenda şi substratul ei istoric\\" István Jósika (Báthory's chancellor and an ethnic Romanian) masterminded the operation. Ștefan Răzvan arrested Aron on charges of treason on the night of 24 April (5 May) and sent him to the Transylvanian capital at Alba Iulia (Gyulafehérvár) with his family and treasure. Aron would die poisoned by the end of May in the castle of Vinc. Sigismund was forced to justify his actions before the European powers, since Aron had played an active role in the anti-Ottoman coalition. Later on, in the same city of Alba Iulia, Wallachian boyars signed a treaty with Sigismund on Michael's behalf. From the point of view of Wallachian internal politics, the Treaty of Alba Iulia officialized what could be called a boyar regime, reinforcing the already important political power of the noble elite. According to the treaty, a council of 12 great boyars was to take part alongside the voivode in the executive rule of the country. Michael the Brave, early 20th-century mural painting Boyars could no longer be executed without the knowledge and approval of the Transylvanian Prince and, if convicted for treason, their fortunes could no longer be confiscated. Apparently Michael was displeased with the final form of the treaty negotiated by his envoys, but was forced to comply. Prince Michael said in a conversation with the Polish envoy Lubieniecki: … they did not proceed as stated in their instructions but as their own good required and obtained privileges for themselves. He would try to avoid the obligations imposed on him for the rest of his reign.Giurescu, p. 186. During his reign, Michael relied heavily on the loyalty and support of a group of Oltenian lords, the most important of whom were Buzescu Brothers (Romanian: Fraţii Buzeşti) and his own relatives on his mother's side, the Cantacuzinos.Manea. He consequently protected their interests throughout his reign; for example, he passed a law binding serfs to lands owned by aristocrats.Panaitescu; Bolovan. From the standpoint of religious jurisdiction, the Treaty of Alba Iulia had another important consequence: it placed all the Eastern Orthodox bishops in Transylvania under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Seat of Târgovişte. A contemporary illustration of Michael the Brave defeating the Turks at Târgovişte in October 1595 A depiction the Battle of Giurgiu in October 1595, first published in 1596 During this period, the Ottoman army, based in Ruse, was preparing to cross the Danube and undertake a major attack. Michael was quickly forced to retreat and the Ottoman forces started to cross the Danube on 4 August 1595. As his army was outnumbered, Michael avoided carrying the battle in open field, and decided to give battle on a marshy field located near the village of Călugăreni on the Neajlov river. The Battle of Călugăreni started on 13 August and Michael defeated the Ottoman army led by Sinan Pasha. Despite the victory, he retreated to his winter camp in Stoieneşti because he had too few troops to mount a full-scale war against the remaining Ottoman forces. He subsequently joined forces with Sigismund Báthory's 40,000-man army (led by István Bocskay) and counterattacked the Ottomans, freeing the towns of Târgovişte (8 October), Bucharest (12 October) and Brăila, temporarily removing Wallachia from Ottoman suzerainty. The fight against the Ottomans continued in 1596 when Michael made several incursions south of the Danube at Vidin, Pleven, Nicopolis, and Babadag, where he was assisted by the local Bulgarians during the First Tarnovo Uprising.Giurescu, p. 189. During late 1596, Michael was faced with an unexpected attack from the Tatars, who had destroyed the towns of Bucharest and Buzău. By the time Michael gathered his army to counterattack, the Tatars had speedily retreated and so no battle was fought. Michael was determined to continue the war against the Ottomans, but he was prevented because he lacked support from Sigismund Báthory and Rudolf II. On 7 January 1597 Hasan Pasha declared the independence of Wallachia under Michael's rule,Giurescu, p. 190. but Michael knew that this was only an attempt to divert him from preparing for another future attack. Michael again requested Rudolf II's support and Rudolf finally agreed to send financial assistance to the Wallachian ruler. On 9 June 1598 a formal treaty was reached between Michael and Rudolf II. According to the treaty, the Austrian ruler would give Wallachia sufficient money to maintain a 5,000-man army, as well as armaments and supplies.Giurescu, p. 191. Shortly after the treaty was signed, the war with the Ottomans resumed and Michael besieged Nicopolis on 10 September 1598 and took control of Vidin. The war with the Ottomans continued until 26 June 1599, when Michael, lacking the resources and support to continue prosecuting the war, signed a peace treaty.  Transylvania  The three principalities under Michael's authority, May – September 1600 Székelys bring the head of cardinal Andrew Báthory to Michael the Brave after the Battle of Şelimbăr In April 1598, Sigismund resigned as Prince of Transylvania in favor of the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II (who was also the King of Hungary); reversed his decision in October 1598; and then resigned again in favor of Cardinal Andrew Báthory, his cousin.Giurescu, p. 192. Báthory had strong ties to the Polish chancellor and hetman Jan Zamoyski and placed Transylvania under the influence of the King of Poland, Sigismund III Vasa. He was also a trusted ally of the new Moldavian Prince Ieremia Movilă, one of Michael's greatest enemies.Giurescu, p. 193. Movilă had deposed Ştefan Rǎzvan with the help of Polish hetman Jan Zamoyski in August 1595. Having to face this new threat, Michael asked Emperor Rudolf to become the sovereign of Wallachia. On 25 September (5 October) Báthory issued an ultimatum demanding that Michael abandon his throne.Giurescu, p. 194. Michael decided to attack Andrew Cardinal Báthory immediately to prevent invasion. He would later describe the events: He left Târgovişte on 2 October, and 9 by October he had reached Prejmer in southern Transylvania, where he met envoys from the city of Braşov. Sparing the city, he moved on to Cârţa where he joined forces with the Székelys. Michael the Brave entering Alba Iulia On 18 October Michael won a decisive victory against the army of prince-cardinal Andrew Báthory at the Battle of Şelimbăr, giving him control of Transylvania. As he retreated from the battle, Andrew Báthory was killed by anti-Báthory Székely on 3 November near Sândominic and Michael gave him a princely burial in the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Alba Iulia.Giurescu, p. 195. With his enemy dead, Michael entered the Transylvanian capital at Alba Iulia and received the keys to the fortress from Bishop Demeter Naprágyi, later depicted as a seminal event in Romanian historiography. Historian István Szamosközy, keeper of the Archives at the time, recorded the event in great detail. He also wrote that two days before the Diet met on 10 October, Transylvanian nobles elected Michael the voivode as Prince of Transylvania. As the Diet was assembled, Michael demanded that the estates swear loyalty to Emperor Rudolf, then to himself and thirdly to his son.Giurescu, p. 196. Even if he was recognized by the Transylvanian diet as only imperial governor subject to the Holy Roman Emperor, he was nonetheless ruler of Transylvania. Michael the Brave at Alba Iulia, portrait by Mișu Popp In Transylvania Michael used the following signature on official documents: Michael Valachiae Transalpinae Woivoda, Sacrae Caesareae Regiae Majestatis Consiliarius per Transylvaniam Locumtenens, cis transylvaniam partium eius super exercitu Generalis Capitaneus\\". (\\"Michael, voivode of Wallachia, the councillor of His Majesty the Emperor and the King, his deputy in Transylvania and General Captain of his troops from Transylvania.\\") When Michael entered Transylvania, he did not immediately free or grant rights to the Romanian inhabitants, who were primarily peasants but, nevertheless, constituted a significant proportion of the population. Michael demonstrated his support by upholding the Union of the Three Nations, which recognized only the traditional rights and privileges of the Hungarians, Székelys and Saxons, but he didn't recognize the rights of the Romanians.Károly Kocsis, Eszter Kocsisné Hodosi, Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin, Simon Publications LLC, 1998, p. 102 (Table 19) There is no evidence that Michael wanted Transylvania's Romanians to play a political role. Indeed, while he brought some of his Wallachian aides to Transylvania, he also invited some Székelys and other Transylvanian Hungarians to assist in the administration of Wallachia, where he wished to transplant Transylvania's far more advanced feudal system. Michael began negotiating with the Emperor over his official position in Transylvania. The latter wanted the principality under direct Imperial rule with Michael acting as governor. The Wallachian voivode, on the other hand, wanted the title of Prince of Transylvania for himself and equally claimed the Partium region. Michael was, nevertheless, willing to acknowledge Habsburg overlordship.Giurescu, p. 196–97. Moldavia Michael the Brave and his daughter Florica at Rudolf's court (detail of a contemporary painting by Frans Francken the Younger) The Moldavian Prince Ieremia Movilă had been an old enemy of Michael, having incited Andrew Báthory to send Michael the ultimatum demanding his abdication. His brother, Simion Movilă, claimed the Wallachian throne for himself and had used the title of Voivode since 1595. Aware of the threat the Movilăs represented, Michael had created the Banate of Buzău and Brăila in July 1598 and the new ban was charged of keeping an alert eye on Moldavian, Tatar and Cossack moves, although Michael had been planning a Moldavian campaign for several years.Giurescu, p. 198. Chancellor Jan Zamoyski On 28 February 1600 Michael met with Polish envoys in Braşov. He was willing to recognise the Polish King as his sovereign in exchange for the crown of Moldavia and the recognition of his male heirs' hereditary right over the three principalities, Transylvania, Moldavia and Wallachia. This did not significantly delay his attack however; on 14 April 1600 Michael's troops entered Moldavia on multiple routes, the Prince himself leading the main thrust to Trotuş and Roman. He reached the capital of Iaşi on 6 May. The garrison surrendered the citadel the next day and Michael's forces caught up with the fleeing Ieremia Movilă, who was saved from being captured only by the sacrifice of his rear-guard. Movilă took refuge in the castle of Khotyn together with his family, a handful of faithful boyars and the former Transylvanian Prince, Sigismund Báthory. The Moldavian soldiers in the castle deserted, leaving a small Polish contingent as sole defenders. Under the cover of dark, sometime before 11 June, Movilă managed to sneak out of the walls and across the Dniester to hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski's camp.Giurescu, p. 199. Neighboring states were alarmed by this upsetting of the balance of power, especially the Hungarian nobility in Transylvania, who rose against Michael in rebellion. With the help of Basta, they defeated Michael at the Battle of Mirăslău, forcing the prince to leave Transylvania together with his remaining loyal troops.Giurescu, p. 201. A Polish army led by Jan Zamoyski drove the Wallachians from Moldavia and defeated Michael at Năieni, Ceptura, and Bucov (Battle of the Teleajăn River). The Polish army also entered eastern Wallachia and established Simion Movilă as ruler. Forces loyal to Michael remained only in Oltenia.Giurescu, p. 200. Last victory and the assassination Michael defeating the Hungarian nobility in Battle of Guruslău, 1601 The assassination of Michael the Brave at Câmpia Turzii, 1601 Michael asked again for assistance from Emperor Rudolf during a visit in Prague between 23 February and 5 March 1601, which was granted when the emperor heard that General Giorgio Basta had lost control of Transylvania to the Hungarian nobility led by Sigismund Báthory, who accepted Ottoman protection. Meanwhile, forces loyal to Michael in Wallachia led by his son, Nicolae Pătrașcu, drove Simion Movilă out of Moldavia and prepared to reenter Transylvania. Michael, allied with Basta, defeated the Hungarian army in Battle of Guruslău. A few days later Basta, who sought to control Transylvania himself, executed the assassination of Michael by the order of the Habsburg Emperor; it took place near Câmpia Turzii on 9 August 1601.Giurescu, p. 201–05. According to Romanian historian Constantin C. Giurescu: Legacy The rule of Michael the Brave, with its break with Ottoman rule, tense relations with other European powers and the leadership of the three states, was considered in later periods as the precursor of a modern Romania, a thesis which was argued with noted intensity by Nicolae Bălcescu. This theory became a point of reference for nationalists, as well as a catalyst for various Romanian forces to achieve a single Romanian state.Giurescu, p. 211–13. To Romanian Romantic nationalists,George W. White, Nationalism and territory: constructing group identity in Southeastern Europe, Rowman & Littlefield, 2000, p. 132 he was regarded as one of Romania's greatest national heroes. Portrait by Theodor Aman (1874) The prince began to be perceived as a unifier towards the middle of the 19th century. Such an interpretation is completely lacking in the historiography of the 17th-century chroniclers, and even in that of the Transylvanian School around 1800. What they emphasized, apart from the exceptional personality of Michael himself, were the idea of Christendom and his close relations with Emperor Rudolf. The conqueror's ambition is likewise frequently cited as a motivation for his action, occupying in the interpretative schema the place that was later to be occupied by the Romanian idea. In the writings of the Moldavian chronicler Miron Costin, Michael the Brave appears in the role of conqueror of Transylvania and Moldavia, \\"the cause of much spilling of blood among Christians\\", and not even highly appreciated by his own Wallachians: \\"The Wallachians became tired of the warful rule of Voivode Mihai\\".Original text: \\"Sa urise muntenilor cu domniia lui Mihai-voda, totii cu osti si razboaie.\\" The perspective of the Wallachians themselves is to be found in The History of the Princes of Wallachia, attributed to the chronicler Radu Popescu (1655–1729), which bundles together all Michael's adversaries without distinction. Romanians and foreigners alike: \\"He subjected the Turks, the Moldavians, and the Hungarians to his rule, as if they were his asses.\\" The picturesque flavor of the expression serves only to confirm the absence of any Romanian idea. Michael the Brave and his troops, 19th-century painting by Nicolae Grigorescu Samuil Micu, a member of the Transylvanian School wrote in his work Short Explanation of the History of the Romanians (written in the 1790s): \\"In the year 1593, Michael, who is called the Brave, succeeded to the lordship of Wallachia. He was a great warrior, who fought the Turks and defeated the Transylvanians. And he took Transylvania and gave it to Emperor Rudolf\\". Petre P. Panaitescu states that in Mihai's time, the concept of the Romanian nation and the desire for unification did not yet exist.Petre Panaitescu – Mihai Viteazul, Bucureşti, 1936 A. D. Xenopol firmly states the absence of any national element in Michael's politics, holding that Michael's lack of desire to join the principalities' administrations proved his actions were not motivated by any such concept.Boia 1997, p. 133 Mihai Viteazu, a commune in Cluj County, was named after Michael the Brave. Michael is also commemorated by the monks of the Athonite Simonopetra Monastery for his great contributions in the form of land and money to rebuilding the monastery that had been destroyed by a fire. Mihai Viteazul, a film by Sergiu Nicolaescu, a famous Romanian film director, is a representation of the life of the Wallachian ruler and his will to unite the three Romanian principalities (Wallachia, Moldavia, and Transylvania) as one domain. The Order of Michael the Brave, Romania's highest military decoration, was named after Michael.Ordinul Mihai Viteazul, ww2awards.com, Retrieved 10 April 2008 Mihai Viteazul's name and portrait appear on at least two Romanian coins: 5 Lei 1991, which only 3 pieces of this type were minted and the coin was not entered into circulation, and on 100 Lei, which circulated through the 1990s.The 100 Lei of 1992 and 1993 are listed as KM # 111 of Krause Mishler catalog Seal Seal of Michael the Brave during his personal union of Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania The seal comprises the coats of arms of Moldavia, Wallachia, and Transylvania: in the middle, on a shield the Moldavian urus, above Wallachian eagle between sun and moon holding cross in beak, below Transylvanian coat of arms: two meeting, standing lions supporting a sword, treading on seven mountains. The Moldavian shield is held by two crowned figures. There are two inscriptions on the seal. First, circular, in Slavonic using Romanian Cyrillic alphabet \\"IO MIHAILI UGROVLAHISCOI VOEVOD ARDEALSCOI MOLD ZEMLI\\", meaning \\"Io Michael Wallachian Voivode of Transylvanian and Moldavian Lands\\".

Early years Rodríguez was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico, a section of the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico where he received both his primary and secondary education. In 1969, he along with millions of other people around the world, witnessed the historical moment when Neil Armstrong from the Apollo mission stepped on the moon's surface. Like so many other young men at the time, Rodríguez felt inspired to consider a career in the Space program of the United States known as NASA.Behind the Scenes After Rodríguez graduated from Colegio Espiritu Santo high school in Hato Rey, in 1971, he enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico's Mayagüez campus, where the Engineering College is located. Rodríguez earned his Mechanical Engineer Degree in 1976, however he had applied for a job with NASA in 1975, a year before his graduation. After graduating, he was called for an interview and offered a job in NASA. He became a mechanical engineer, designing parts for the Space Shuttle, at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.Rodríguez Career in NASA In 1979, Rodríguez was transferred to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida where he was responsible for the activation and validation of facilities for processing Space Shuttle payloads and experiments. He rose through the engineering ranks and was promoted to the position of Payload Integration Engineer responsible for the STS-31 Hubble Space Telescope payload processing, testing and launch activities. He started his management career in 1990 supervising a group of engineers responsible for integrating experiments in the Spacelab Module.

Standing in water deep it is across at its widest point. Geography Mitiaro, also known as Nukuroa, is part of the Nga-Pu-Toru island group formerly, a volcano that became a coral atoll. The coral died forming fossilised coral (known locally as makatea).Mitiaro, Cook Islands Cookislands.org.uk The island is surrounded by a belt of this makatea, between high and characteristic of islands in the southern group. The centre of the island is almost flat, quite swampy and contains two freshwater lakes, Rotonui (big lake) and Toto Iti (small lake). The lakes are teeming with eels (Anguilla obscura), which the locals call itiki, and the imported tilapia from Africa where it is known as bream. Beaches are limited but there are crystal- clear pools ideal for swimming in the subterranean limestone caves and the beach at low tide abounds in interesting marine life. The island has four villages, located close together on the western side, from north to south: #Taurangi (a former village) #Atai (also called Arai) #Auta #Mangarei #Takaue Among the populated lifted coral islands of the southern Cook Islands, only Mitiaro is not subdivided into traditional tapere. Mitiaro School is located in the principal village, Atai. Takaue is the second largest village. Mitiaro Airport is located at the northern end of the island. There are three churches: the Cook Islands Christian Church, the Catholic Church and the Assembly of God. In May 2018 the island's diesel generator was replaced by a solar-photovoltaic system.  History  According to oral tradition Mitiaro was settled from Atiu, and was historicly dominated by that island. It was first discovered by Europeans when John Williams of the London Misisonary Society arrived in 1823. He left behind a Polynesian teacher, Taua, who began converting the islanders to Christianity. The estimated population at that time was less than 100 inhabitants. During the 1840s the island was attacked again by Atiuans. In 1888 Mitiaro became a British protectorate as part of the Cook Islands Federation. In 1901 it was annexed by New Zealand.

The ScanEagle was designed by Insitu based on the Insitu SeaScan, a commercial UAV that was intended for fish-spotting. The ScanEagle continues to receive improvements through upgrades and changes. Design and development ScanEagle is a descendant of another Insitu UAV, the Insitu SeaScan, which was conceived of as a remote sensor for collecting weather data as well as helping commercial fishermen locate and track schools of tuna. ScanEagle emerged as the result of a strategic alliance between Boeing and Insitu. The resulting technology has been successful as a portable Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) for autonomous surveillance in the battlefield, and has been deployed since August 2004 in the Iraq War. ScanEagle carries a stabilized electro-optical and/or infrared camera on a lightweight inertial stabilized turret system, and an integrated communications system having a range of over ; it has a flight endurance of over 20 hours. ScanEagle has a wingspan a length of and a mass of and can operate up to , with an average cruising speed of .

A Block D aircraft, flying at Boeing's test range in Boardman, Oregon, set a type endurance record of 22 hours, 8 minutes.\\"Boeing ScanEagle achieves major flight milestones\\", Aerotech News & Review, November 23, 2006. Sea-borne launch from a Mark V Special Operations Craft ScanEagle needs no airfield for deployment. Instead, it is launched using a pneumatic launcher, patented by Insitu, known as the \\"SuperWedge\\" launcher. It is recovered using the \\"Skyhook\\" retrieval system, which uses a hook on the end of the wingtip to catch a rope hanging from a pole. This is made possible by high-quality differential GPS units mounted on the top of the pole and UAV. The rope is attached to a shock cord to reduce stress on the airframe imposed by the abrupt stop. NavtechGPS worked with the manufacturer of the GPS receiver system to enable the system to work in different environments, expanding the capabilities of the UAS for different mission types and areas of the world. The GPS receiver system NavtechGPS designed for the ScanEagle is still in use today. Each ScanEagle system costs US$3.2 million (2006). A complete system comprises four air vehicles or AVs, a ground control station, remote video terminal, the SuperWedge launch system and Skyhook recovery system. =Improvements= A ScanEagle in its catapult launcher On 18 March 2008, Boeing, with ImSAR and Insitu successfully flight- tested a ScanEagle with ImSAR's NanoSAR A radar mounted aboard.

The Coast Guard hopes to begin purchases of unmanned aerial systems by FY 2016, with small UAVs deployed from its National Security Cutter fleet by the following year. Long-term goals are to use unmanned systems to augment their manned fleet, while UAVs on offshore patrol cutters would replace medium endurance cutters.\\"UAV a success for Coast Guard in major drug bust\\" Military Times, 10 August 2013 On 26 July 2013, the ScanEagle became one of the first unmanned aerial vehicles to be granted certification by the Federal Aviation Administration to fly in U.S. airspace for commercial purposes. ScanEagles will be deployed to Alaska off a ship for ConocoPhillips to scout for icebergs and count whales, protecting drilling platforms and fulfilling environmental requirements. The ScanEagle can safely accomplish observation missions in hazardous Arctic locations, which is safer, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly than using manned aircraft. Commercial certification was the result of previous military certification and the Congressionally mandated opening of airspace over much of Alaska to small UAVs. Only four ScanEagles were certified with strict requirements: only one aircraft of the type is allowed airborne at any one time, they cannot fly through clouds or icing conditions, and they cannot take off or land during certain gust and wind conditions.

The A-545 is a successor variant of the AEK-971 that was announced on 23 December 2014, which features numerous internal and external improvements over its predecessor. History The AEK-971 was developed to participate in a competition announced by the Ministry of Defense of the USSR, during which preference was given to the AN-94. The initial AEK version differs from modern samples, as many innovations were perceived as unnecessary by the Ministry of Defence, which led to a simplification of the early model. The AEK-971 is approximately lighter than the AN-94, simpler in design and cheaper to manufacture. The AEK-971 assault rifle has been combat proven in Chechnya tested by naval infantry and interior forces, and prepared for mass production. Only a few small batches of this assault rifle have been produced so far and adopted for service with units of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation. Though losing an initial contract for production against the AN-94 as a result of the Project Abakan assault rifle selection trials held from 1980 to 1994 in Russia, the Russian Army begun field trials of this weapon. The AN-94 assault rifle, which was officially adopted by Russian army, has a slight accuracy edge over the AEK-971 in 2-round-burst mode. In full automatic mode or during longer bursts (3–10 rounds per burst) the AEK-971 is more accurate. In late 2014, an updated variant of the rifle passed state trials and will be tested operationally with Russian forces in early 2015.BREAKING: Russian Army Accepts Both AK-12 And AEK-971 - Thefirearmblog.com, 23 December 2014 On 23 December 2014, the Russian Army announced that a successor variant of the AEK-971 line, designated as the A-545 (official GRAU designation 6P67), along with their main rival the AK-12, had passed state Ratnik trials and would be accepted into service with operational units for evaluation. Both systems were recommended for initial batch production and issue for trials in the field. It is possible that in the end both rifles will be adopted by Russian military and other agencies, with the AEK series being oriented towards Special Operations Forces (Spetsnaz) and AK-12 towards infantry and other units. It was expected that both rifles would be trialed operationally with the Russian Armed Forces by March 2015. In March 2017, it was revealed that the A-545 would be accepted into Russian service after testing was completed along with the AK-12, although serving border patrol regiments, special forces, and the national guard due to its more complicated and expensive design while the AK-12 would arm regular infantry forces. In January 2018 it was announced that the rifle has been adopted in 5.45×39mm and 7.62×39mm chamberings by the Russian military. Design details An early prototype model of the AEK-971 AEK-971 stripped down to its major components The AEK-971 is based on previous AK rifles in internal design and layout, but features a Balanced Automatics Recoil System (BARS) that enhances the traditional Kalashnikov long stroke gas piston operating system by reducing the negative effects of recoil. Balanced recoil systems were previously applied in the AO-38 and AL-7 experimental assault rifles and in the AK-107 and AK-108. BARS works by shifting mass toward the muzzle of the rifle as the bolt and bolt carrier recoil rearward by way of a counter-weight that negates the impulse of the gas piston and bolt carrier, resulting in more controllable automatic fire. For the AEK-971 automatic firing accuracy is improved by 15-20% in comparison with the AK-74M. The AEK-971's iron sights features an adjustable notched rear tangent rear sight calibrated in increments from and a hooded front post. Each AEK assault rifle is fitted with a Warsaw Pact side-rail bracket for mounting optics. The travel distance of the reciprocating parts of the AEK-971 is less than compared to the non-balanced recoil AK-pattern designs, thus increasing its cyclic rate of fire significantly. The original cyclic rate of fire of the early prototype model was 1,500 rounds per minute (RPM) and was later decreased to 900 rounds per minute (RPM) for the production model. The AEK-971 is fed through standard 5.45×39mm 30-round or larger box magazines used by the AK-74, RPK-74 and other similar 5.45×39mm Russian weapons. Variants There are three main variants of the AEK assault rifles: the AEK-971, AEK-972 and AEK-973. The different variants are most easily recognized by their respective magazine curvatures. The AEK-971S and AEK-973S are improved variants of the AEK-971 and AEK-973 which features a three-round burst fire mode and numerous improvements. A heavily improved variant of the AEK-971 and AEK-973 lines' designated as A-545 and A-762 was later released and is set to be used in the Russian Special Operations Forces (Spetsnaz). = AEK-971 = The AEK-971 is chambered in 5.45×39mm. It uses all of the standard 5.45×39mm AK-74 and RPK-74 magazines.  AEK-971S  An improved variant of the AEK-971 with a new trigger mechanism with the location of the thumb safety-selector lever on the right side, receiving additionally a three-shot burst fire mode, and an extended padded retractable lightweight stock. When the stock is retracted, the shoulder rest connects with the pistol grip forming a streamlined structure which allows the weapon to be used without hampering fire capabilities. The burst fire accuracy of the 5.45×39mm AEK-971S is two times higher than that of the 5.45×39mm AK-74M assault rifle. = AEK-972 = The AEK-972 is chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO. It uses the magazines of the 5.56×45mm NATO chambered arms of the AK-100 rifle family, the AK-101, AK-102 carbine, and AK-108. = AEK-973 = The AEK-973 is chambered in 7.62×39mm. It uses all of the standard 7.62×39mm AK-47, AKM and RPK magazines.  AEK-973S  An improved variant of the AEK-973 with a new trigger mechanism with the location of the thumb safety-selector lever on the right side, receiving additionally a three-shot burst fire mode, and an extended padded retractable lightweight stock. When the stock is retracted, the shoulder rest connects with the pistol grip forming a streamlined structure which allows the weapon to be used without hampering fire capabilities. Burst fire accuracy of the 7.62×39mm AEK-973S is two times higher than that of the 7.62×39mm AKM assault rifle. =A-545= alt= A successor variant of the AEK-971 line designated as the A-545 (official GRAU designation 6P67), chambered in 5.45×39mm. The rifle features numerous internal and external improvements over earlier AEK-971 models. The changes includes iron sights that consist of a rotary rear drum aperture and a hooded front post creating a significantly longer sight line, an ambidextrous fire mode selectors/safety levers, a 2-round burst feature, retractable and adjustable shoulder stock. Also the Warsaw Pact side-rail bracket is omitted and replaced by a Picatinny Rail on a redesigned receiver top for mounting auxiliary equipment, such as optical red dot sights. =A-762= A successor variant of the AEK-973 line designated as the A-762 (official GRAU designation 6P68), evidently in similar design to the A-545. The rifle only differs from the A-545 on its calibre that is being chambered with, which is the 7.62×39mm. Users * : AEK-971 rifles were produced in small batches and delivered to units of the MVD Internal Troops (paramilitary gendarmerie-like forces) and other law enforcement agencies of Russia.

The village was destroyed several times during the Hussite wars and the Ottoman occupation of Hungary. In 1711 a plague killed the inhabitants. The village was mentioned again in 1786. Its lumber mill, the predecessor of today's lumber factory was built in 1875. It was followed by the construction of a narrow gauge railway route, the first forest railway in Hungary. The national animal fair has been organized in Pálháza regularly since 1914. After the Treaty of Trianon Pálháza became a village near the new state border, but the village began to prosper again. In 1958 a mine was opened nearby. In spite of local protests the narrow gauge railway line was demolished in 1980, but was built again after 1989.

In Zambia, they are found in two districts of Eastern province namely Nyimba and Petauke. They are also dialects with the Nsenga Luzi of the Luangwa valley in Chief Nyalugwe, Mboloma and Lwembe and the Chikunda of Luangwa Boma (Feira). Their Senior Chief is Kalindawalo M'ndikula who resides in Merwe 10 kilometers from Petauke Boma. His subjects include Chief Mwape, Nyamphande, Nyanje, Mumbi, Sandwe, Nyalugwe, Ndake, Lwembe and Mwanjaw'anthu. They are well known for their culture and artwork which includes bead work and basketry. They also grow groundnuts, maize, millet and sorghum for consumption and cotton (Thonje) as cash crop, and are popular for their Mbewa (Mice), a practice which they are often teased for. The Nsenga language (also called Chinsenga) spoken by people of this tribe is similar to Chinyanja. Origin The Nsenga people are believed to have migrated into Zambia around the 14th century from the Luba – Lunda kingdom as distinct language. Nsenga means land of sand. (In songye language Nsenga means earth.) the Nsenga people share much more same culture with the lala people. The strong historical assumption is that the Nsenga people followed the same pattern of movements as the lamba, swaka, lila lala and Bisa. This comes clearly as a typical comparison between nsenga and Chichewa and Nsenga and Bemba outlines much similarity to Bemba, Bisa and lala compared to Chichewa. A typical vocabulary analysis on selected Katanga languages, further proves that Nsenga was indeed a distinct language and clearly dispels the assumption that nsenga could have been an off short of chewa. Nsenga people might have directly originated from Katanga alongside or from the same source as the lala, Bemba, lamba and the Bisa people. The Nsenga people’s chiefdom ship could have not been so strengthened compared to other tribes as seen from the fact that most of the Nsenga chiefs were installed by the British and the chewa people, a case of kalindawaro who was left as a caretaker of the land by Undi of the Chewa people. Chewa Influence Historical review shows that the Nsenga people were to a large extent influenced by the Chewa people interns of language, culture and way of living. Nsenga language is mutually intelligible to the Chichewa language. This suggests that the Nsengas could have been settled in the eastern province of Zambia much earlier than the Chewa. This was actually done before the Chewa people had actually moved toward Malawi and Mozambique.

Giglioli was born in London and first studied there. He obtained a degree in science at the University of Pisa in 1864 and started to teach zoology in Florence in 1869. Marine vertebrates, and invertebrates, were his academic interest but he was a noted amateur ornithologist and photographer. Giglioli was director of the Royal Zoological Museum in Florence, Italy. He wrote up the zoology of the voyage of the corvette on which he had taken over from Filippo de Filippi. Professor De Filippi died in Hong Kong in 1867.He was also involved in the activities of the Florence School of Anthropology and through this developed an interest in ethnography. Whale sightings In 1870 he reported seeing a new species of whale (unofficially called Giglioli's Whale) off the coast of Chile long with two dorsal fins observed by Giglioli from Magenta, a warship of the Italian Royal Navy.Matthew A. Bille, Rumors of Existence: Newly Discovered, Supposedly Extinct, and Unconfirmed Inhabitants of the Animal Kingdom, Hancock House, 1995, p. 158. The Rorqual is the only similarly configured whale in the fossil record. A similar whale was seen a year later off the coast of Scotland. The two dorsal fins were said to be over six feet high, with a large pair of flippers. It was provisionally named Anphiptera Pacifica, and is an unrecognized species of, not having been confirmed by enough sightings to be recognized as a species. Magenta was. The voyage of the \\"Magenta\\" was sponsored by the Government of Italy in the 19th century. He also reported a stranding of a Cuvier's beaked whale in the Mediterranean Sea. He also reported Killer Whales and Fin whales in the Mediterranean. Other work Giglioli conducted a detailed study of the chimpanzee skulls which his friend Georg August Schweinfurth collected in the region of today's southern Sudan. He named the species Troglodytes schweinfurthii Species:Pan troglodytes. After his death, Giglioli's collection, together with his extensive archaeological and ethnological library (from 1885 Giglioli concentrated on his ethnographic collection exchanging specimens with the Smithsonian Institution and fellow naturalists, notably Edward Pierson Ramsay), went to the Pigorini National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography where they are now conserved.

Because it is only in size and has a very dangerous landing at the northwest corner of the reef, it has been designated a wildlife sanctuary, mainly for the red-tailed tropicbirds and red-footed boobies. Administratively, the island is considered part of Atiu, the closest island. It is owned equally by all inhabitants of Atiu and not allocated to one specific village or district of Atiu. The wildlife sanctuary is administered by a Trust and special permission for visits is needed from the Trust Chairman, High Chief Rongomatane Ariki. Alternatively, it is possible join the research vessel Bounty Bay for an eco tour, run by Pacific Expeditions Ltd. out of Rarotonga, the main island of the Cook Islands. Copra cutters from Atiu visit once a year to cut coconuts from the trees, and a quantity of the tail feathers of the tropic birds. The conservation service, made up of local residents from other islands, makes regular trips to the island to monitor the conservation. In 2004 a television episode of Survivorman (Les Stroud) was filmed on Takutea Island. History The original name of the island was Areuna until it was renamed by Mariri, one of Atiu's ancestors. When Mariri returned for the third time from Avaiki to Atiu together with his wife, he landed on the small islet, which he had seen on his previous visits to Atiu. While fishing, he caught a “white Ku”, that is “Ku tea”, and therefore called the island Ta-Ku-Tea, My White Ku, later shortened to Takutea. Another name for the island is Enua-iti (Small Island). Takutea is the only island in the Cook Islands that never had a permanent population. When Captain James Cook sighted the island on 4 April 1777, and some crew members went ashore, they found some huts, but no evidence of a permanent settlement. Commander Nicolls of H.M.S “Cormorant” declared the island to be under British protection in June 1889.

The word \\"chemurgy\\" was coined by chemist William J. Hale and first publicized in his 1934 book The Farm Chemurgic, the concept was mildly well-developed by the early years of the 20th century. For example, a number of products, including brushes and motion picture film, were made from cellulose. Beginning in the 1920s, some prominent Americans began to advocate a more widespread link between farmers and industry. Among them were William J. Hale and agricultural journalist Wheeler McMillen. The Hemp Body or Soybean Car  Automaker Henry Ford began to test farm crops for their industrial potential around 1930, and soon settled on hemp and the soybean as particularly promising (the famous Hemp Body or Soybean Car). The Ford Motor Company used soybeans in such parts as gearshift knobs and horn buttons, and hemp for the body of the car. The automobile was designed to run on hemp diesel. Ford Motor Company accessed these innovations via the discovery and ingenuity of George Washington Carver, Tuskegee Scientist and Father of Chemurgy. In 1935, the Farm Chemurgic Council (later renamed the National Farm Chemurgic Council) was formed to encourage greater use of renewable raw materials in industry. In its early years, the Council received substantial publicity. It was perceived by the Roosevelt Administration as a political threat, since Council leaders questioned U.S. Department of Agriculture policies. First placing much of its emphasis on demonstrating the benefits of Agrol (a line of blended motor fuels that included ethanol), the Council drew strong opposition from the petroleum industry. The Agrol pilot plant, which also experienced management and financial difficulties, shut down in 1938. Wheeler McMillen, who had become president of the Council the previous year, decided to distance the chemurgy movement from ethanol, mend fences with the petroleum industry, and place the Council on a more cautious course. The Council’s cause received an unexpected boost when Theodore G. Bilbo, a U.S. senator from Mississippi, sought a means to promote new uses for his region’s surplus cotton. To make his goal more politically attractive, he supported a broader research program. In the end, four regional U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratories, dedicated to finding new uses for farm crops, were authorized under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938. The labs were established in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania; New Orleans, Louisiana; Peoria, Illinois; and Albany, California. Over time, their research agendas expanded, and they became less focused on chemurgy. Nevertheless, their involvement in that field was symbolic of the chemurgy movement’s transformation from a cause associated with Roosevelt Administration critics to one with clear support from that administration. Emergence Chemurgy demonstrated its worth during World War II, particularly in alleviating the rubber shortage caused when Japan cut off most of America's supply. Corn was used as raw material in much of the synthetic rubber produced during the war. Various other plants, including guayule and kok-saghyz (Russian dandelion), were investigated as rubber sources. In the American Midwest, school children were encouraged to gather milkweed floss, previously considered a nuisance but now valued for a new role as a filler in military life jackets. A priest in Iowa even made news by urging congregants to grow hemp, whose previous reputation as a drug hazard yielded to military requirements for rope and cordage. Decline Prospects for chemurgy appeared promising into the 1950s. An article in the December 3, 1951 issue of Newsweek, for example, said \\"the flood of chemurgy seems to be swelling.\\" But as uses of agricultural raw materials advanced, so did uses for petrochemicals, and non-renewable materials eventually won out in a number of markets. Petrochemical detergents were widely used in place of agriculturally derived soaps, and petrochemical plastic wrapping material largely replaced cellophane. The Chemurgic Council went through a period of decline and finally closed its doors in 1977. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in chemurgy, although the word itself has largely fallen out of usage. In 1990, Wheeler McMillen then 97 years old, addressed a national conference of latter-day chemurgic enthusiasts in Washington, DC. The conference served to launch the New Uses Council, which seeks to further the cause formerly promoted by the Chemurgic Council. George Washington Carver was one of the most famous scientists of this field. In the Environmental Biography of George Washington Carver titled \\"My Work is that of Conservation\\" author Mark D. Hersey writes, \\"Thus, although he accepted the honorary mantle of \\"the first and greatest chemurgist,\\" he was hardly in its mainstream. On the contrary, Carver often misconstrued the movement's aims, imagining they fell more in line with his own than in fact they did. Because Carver had devoted his energies to improving the lives of impoverished black farmers, he saw chemurgy as a field in which science addressed \\"a great human problem.\\" His 1936 injunction to \\"chemicalize the farm\\" sprang from his abhorrence of waste rather than a desire for profit, let alone an affinity for chemical pesticides and fertilizers. He wanted \\"waste products of the farm\\" to be used for making \\"insulating boards, paints, dyes, industrial alcohol, plastics of various kinds, rugs, mats and cloth from fiber plants, oils, gums and waxes, etc.\\" Substitution examples *Kenaf for jute (rope) *castor oil for petroleum-based oil (lubrication) See also * Decorticator * Semisynthesis Notes Category:History of chemistry ","title":"Chemurgy"},{"id":"2468807","text":"The hwacha or hwach'a (; Hanja: ; literally \\"fire cart\\") was a multiple rocket launcher and an organ gun of similar design which were developed in fifteenth century Korea. The former variant fired one or two hundred rocket-powered arrows while the latter fired several dozen iron-headed arrows or bolts out of gun barrels. The term was used to refer to other war wagons or other cart- based artillery in later periods, such as that developed by Byeon Yijung in the 1590s. These weapons were notably deployed in the defense of the Korean Peninsula against the invading Japanese when they invaded in the 1590s. Some East Asian historians believe this technological breakthrough, alongside the turtle ship in the mid-16th century, had a distinctive effect during the war. Today, hwachas appear in Korean museums, national parks, and popular culture.  History  Plans for Hwacha assembly and disassembly. Left mid and below are front and rear of Singijeon rocket launcher modules, things at right are front and rear of organ gun modules (Gukjo-orye-seorye, 1474) = Early Firearms = Firearms were recognized by Goryeo military leaders as being of utmost importance in national defense. Constituting a particular threat were Japanese raiders who frequently plundered coastal towns in increasing numbers from 1350 onward. Gunpowder and firearms explicitly for combating them on the sea were imported from China in 1374 but the necessary expertise for production was still restricted by Chinese government policy. Numerous ancient Chinese documents relating to gunpowder based weapons such as the Huolongjing were acquired by the Koreans in addition to small samples of Chinese gunpowder which the Koreans reverse engineered. Local production did not begin until Choe Mu-seon, having acquired the methods for purifying potassium nitrate from visiting Chinese merchants, accomplished it between 1374–1376. A government office for the development of gunpowder and firearms was established in 1377 with Choe appointed its head. A number of weapons were developed here, based on Chinese designs, including hand-cannon and a series of rockets, in particular the juhwa. = Hwacha = The hwacha was a further development from the juhwa and the singijeon. The first hwacha was developed in Korea in 1409 during the Joseon Dynasty by several Korean scientists, including Yi Do (이도, not to be mistaken for Sejong the Great, even though their names sound similar) and Choi Hae-san (최해산, son of Choe Museon). Stronger and more effective hwachas were made in 1451 under the decree of King Munjong, by the king himself and his younger brother Pe. ImYung (Yi Gu, 임영대군 이구). This \\"Munjong Hwacha\\" is a well-known type that nowadays could fire 100 rocket arrows or 200 small Chongtong bullets at one time with changeable modules. At the time, 50 units were deployed in Hanseong (present-day Seoul), and another 80 on the northern border. By the end of 1451, hundreds of hwachas were deployed throughout the peninsula. = Imjin wars (1592–1598) = Hwachas saw action most extensively against the Japanese during their invasions of Korea. The hwachas were mostly placed in fortresses or citadels, and used defensively. They proved to be powerful in many battles, and were most prominent in the Battle of Haengju, in which 3,400 Koreans repelled 30,000 Japanese with the help of 40 hwachas. The Japanese samurai infantry, especially in the Battle of Haengju, typically advanced in dense formations, presenting ideal targets for the hwacha. Hwachas were also used on panokseons under the navy of Admiral Yi Sun-sin to attack Japanese ships from a distance.  Components  Hwacha loaded with singijeon projectiles. The hwacha's structure was very similar to a handcart, with a mobile wooden launchpad on the top containing 100 to 200 cylindrical holes, into which igniters like those of the sajeonchongtong (사전총통) were placed. The ammunition, similar to the ancient Chinese fire arrows, consisted of a 1.1 m long arrow with the addition of a gunpowder-filled paper tube attached to the shaft just below the head. Approximately 100 projectiles were loaded and launched in one volley, and had a range of up to 2000 m. One variant had 5 rows of 10 gun barrels in the launchpad, each of which could fire a bundle of four arrow-like projectiles. The back side of the hwacha featured two parallel arms that allowed the operator to push and pull the machine, and a vertical strip designed for in-line attacks or stand ground-sentry positions. The wagon-like wheels were usually fastened by wood pivots and iron axles. In order to reduce friction between the wheels and the axles, tar oil was used. Hwachas were usually made of pine wood, although there are some versions made of oak. The ropes used were usually made of hemp. The Korean army included siege engineers and blacksmiths in order to make repairs to the hwacha in case of damage due to poor road conditions, bad weather, or battle.  Projectiles  Hwacha launch pad, ignitors placed in the narrow section of each arrow to be fired Unlike the cannons or mortars used in Western warfare during Middle Ages and the 16th century, which required heavy iron balls, hwachas fired arrows which were thin and light, making it an easy-to-maneuver siege weapon. The holes in the hwacha's launching array ranged in diameter from 2.5 to 4 cm, which allowed thin Gungdo bow-like arrows to be fired and also admitted sajeonchongtong class igniters placed in the back side of the shooting board. Singijeon-class projectiles were small arrows designed by Korean siege engineers specifically to be used in hwachas. Called so (소), or \\"small\\", they possessed a pouch of black powder attached in the bottom near to the fletching section. Besides the singijeon-class projectiles, hwacha could also fire 100 steel-tipped rockets. Because of the large numbers of arrows fired from hwachas and the widespread damage of its attack, a dense formation presented an ideal target for hwachas.  Ballistics and range  The trajectory of the so projectiles was fairly flat and – like other spinning projectiles – affected by the Magnus effect. Operators used to fire the weapon at an elevation of nearly 45° to maximise range. Adverse weather conditions (wind, humidity, rain) during a battle generally limited their striking distance to about 100 m. Hwachas' range could be extended if the siege weapon was situated on a hill or other elevated place. Singijeon arrows from that position had a range of about 500 yards (≈450 meters). A 15th-century account from the Annals of Joseon Dynasty tells of an experiment in which the singijeon fired from a hwacha completely pierced a scarecrow armed with a suit of armour and shield, at the range of 80 paces (about 100 m).  Usage  A hwacha from the Yungwon pilbi, 1813 Hwachas were mostly used in a defensive manner; however, some Western and East Asian historians have concluded that in some cases they were used offensively in sea-to-land attacks and in naval warfare as well, particularly in the Battle of Noryang Point, during the Imjin wars in 1598. Hwachas were usually carried to battle highly escorted. Once the army settled down in trenches or base camps, the operators would disassemble the siege weapon by placing the launching array on the top. Hwachas were similar to European trebuchets to transport, and required assembling before usage. All the pieces featured similar characteristics and the mobile launching array could be unpacked and easily placed on the wood frame on the top of cart. Once a hwacha was set up for combat, the operators would use the gunpowder stored in a boot-like bag tied on each igniter to be used for each hole on the machine. After that, the operators were able to load the hwacha with arrows or iron spikes and be ready to shoot. To do so, they stepped back, covered their ears, and pulled the rope for each igniter. At sea, manoeuvres were slightly different and more complex because the operator would need to find a proper and stable place to fire. Some Hwacha operators preferred to be on the rowers' deck where they were able to shoot from the windows, while others preferred to be on the main deck so they could shoot at the sails of the enemy ships. These kind of manoeuvres were particularly seen on Korean Panokseon warships.

It runs 535 feet (175 meters) over the Delaware River, from Minisink Ford, New York, to Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania. Opened in 1849 as an aqueduct connecting two parts of the Delaware & Hudson Canal (D&H;), it has since been converted to carry automotive traffic and pedestrians. Construction The bridge begun in 1847 as one of four suspension aqueducts on the D&H; Canal, a system of transportation connecting the coal fields of northeastern Pennsylvania with markets on the Hudson River. The canal opened in 1828, was enlarged after the 1840s, and closed in 1898. The bridge before restoration. The suspension cables are hidden in the restored aqueduct by the canal sides Russell F. Lord and John A. Roebling designed the bridge and supervised its construction. Two important local industries with conflicting needs brought about construction of Roebling's Delaware and Lackawaxen Aqueducts: canal traffic and timber rafting. Since the mid-18th century, timber from the Delaware valley had been floated down the river to shipyards and industries in Trenton and Philadelphia. The D&H; Canal's rope ferry crossing of the Delaware at Lackawaxen created a bottleneck, and there were numerous collisions with timber rafts headed downstream. In 1846, to alleviate both problems, the D&H; Canal Company approved Russell F. Lord's plan to substitute two new aqueducts in place of the rope ferry.(Vogel 1971, p. 9) After evaluating several options, Lord recommended designs submitted by John A. Roebling, who had already built a wire suspension aqueduct at Pittsburgh in 1845.(Vogel 1971, p. 4) To raise the canal enough to allow the passage of ice floes and river traffic, Lord's plan called for three locks to be built on the eastern side.National Park Service. Interpretive sign at the bridge site. Accessed: August 22, 2011 An immediate success, the Delaware Aqueduct -- which cost $41,750 - and the Lackawaxen Aqueduct -- which cost $18,650, and of which only the abutments remain - reduced canal travel time by one full day, saving thousands of dollars annually.(Vogel 1971, p. 10) Post-construction history After the canal closed in 1898, the aqueduct was drained and converted into a vehicular bridge. Eventually, the canal sides and towpaths (walkways for those pulling barges) were removed. It operated as a toll bridge for wagons and, later, motor vehicles until 1979. Portions of the D&H; Canal, including the Delaware Aqueduct, were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1968. The Delaware Aqueduct is also designated by the American Society of Civil Engineers as a National Civil Engineering Landmark. The National Park Service bought the bridge in 1980. The agency rebuilt the bridge's superstructure from Roebling's original plans and specification in 1986, and in 1995, the wooden icebreakers, towpaths and aqueduct walls were reconstructed, restoring the bridge's original appearance as an aqueduct. The bridge is now part of the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River.National Park Service \\"Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct See also *Roebling Suspension Bridge *List of bridges documented by the Historic American Engineering Record in New York *List of bridges documented by the Historic American Engineering Record in Pennsylvania *List of crossings of the Delaware River *National Register of Historic Places listings in Pike County, Pennsylvania *National Register of Historic Places listings in Sullivan County, New York References Notes Sources * Further reading * External links  * * Category:Bridges completed in 1847 Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania Category:Bridges over the Delaware River Category:Bridges in Sullivan County, New York Category:Bridges in Pike County, Pennsylvania Category:Historic American Engineering Record in New York (state) Category:Historic American Engineering Record in Pennsylvania Category:Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks Category:National Register of Historic Places in Sullivan County, New York Category:Road bridges in New York (state) Category:Road bridges in Pennsylvania Category:Suspension bridges in Pennsylvania Category:Suspension bridges in New York (state) Category:Tourist attractions in Sullivan County, New York Category:Former toll bridges in New York (state) Category:Former toll bridges in Pennsylvania Category:1847 establishments in the United States Category:Interstate vehicle bridges in the United States Category:Wooden bridges in New York (state) Category:Wooden bridges in Pennsylvania ","title":"Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct"},{"id":"2468845","text":"The V District on a map of Turku.

She is a prolific contributor to many feminist and underground anthologies, such as Wimmen's Comix and Gay Comix. Career While attending college, Gregory was exposed to the underground comix movement, one of the first times she had seen widespread works by female comic artists. At school, she contributed full-page strips called \\"Frieda the Feminist\\" and other artwork to Phil Yeh's campus humor paper, Uncle Jam, as well as art for the Women's Resource Center newsletter. Gregory began her career in earnest in 1974 by sending a strip titled \\"A Modern Romance\\" to the all-female Wimmen's Comix anthology. She also created the strip Feminist Funnies in 1974, expanding it in 1976 for her own original comic book Dynamite Damsels, after it was rejected by Wimmen's Comix due to an alleged similarity to her other work.Dynamite Damsels was the first continuing series self published comic by a woman. Gregory has commented on this, stating that she was unaware of the groundbreaking nature of her work at the time of publishing. She continued to contribute to many other underground comix in the 1970s, including Gay Comix (later renamed Gay Comics) and Robert Kirby's Strange Looking Exile. She is the most prolific contributor to Gay Comix, having appeared in nearly every one of its 25 issues.Mangels, Andy. “A History of Contributors” Gay Comics #25. Jul 1998. Print. In 1990 Gregory created \\"Bitchy Bitch\\" Midge McCracken, a woman angry at the world who frequently explodes with rage.Bitchy Bitch at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on March 6, 2015. She starred in the 40-issue series Naughty Bits, which was published by Fantagraphics from 1991 to 2004. Bitchy Bitch has a lesbian counterpart character named Bitchy Butch. Beginning in 2001, a series of shorts featuring Bitchy Bitch called Bitchy Bits was shown on the Oxygen Network animated series X-Chromosome.Beck, Jerry. \\"TV Review: X-Chromosome,\\" ANIMATIONWorld (October 8, 2001). Life's a Bitch, an animated series spun-off from the X-Chromosome shorts, aired from 2003–2004 on Oxygen in the U.S. and on The Comedy Network in Canada. Gregory's other work includes the fantasy graphic novel Winging It (a spinoff of a comic she wrote for Gay Comix), the 3-issue series Artistic Licentiousness, and the comic strip Sheila and the Unicorn. Much of Gregory's recent work has focused on illustrated stories of her own and others' cats. Real Cat Toons was initially published as a fundraiser for her cat's medical bills, but was republished with additional material under the title True Cat Toons. She is one of the contributors to Free to Fight, the interactive self-defense project for women. She is currently working to complete Mother Mountain, the first chapter of which is available to read free on her website. Originally conceived as a spin-off from Winging It, Gregory has been working sporadically on it since the 1990s. Though it began as a graphic novel, she eventually chose to begin again, limiting it to text only. Gregory has stated that the story will span four novels, two of which are complete. She has also planned to complete a graphic novel prequel. Describing its content, Gregory states that the work is a fantasy romance which deals with the consequences of choices made in youth.

The channel started its test broadcasting on 5 May 1990. For a brief time in the early 1990s, it was called Star Magic Box because the name Star 1 was copyrighted by another media corporation.

They frequently collaborate with Dario Argento, most notably creating soundtracks for Profondo Rosso in 1975 and Suspiria in 1977. CD re-releases of their soundtracks have performed well, especially in Germany and Japan. Goblin returned with a series of live concerts in Europe in 2009 and in North America in 2013. Initially recording as Cherry Five (they had done some live gigs as Oliver), their early work spawned one eponymous progressive rock record, and they were then called in to compose the soundtrack for Profondo Rosso. The band changed their name to Goblin, rewriting most of the score, originally written by Giorgio Gaslini including the famous main theme. The 1975 soundtrack album was a huge hit. After a reshuffle in their line-up, they put out an instrumental progressive rock album Roller, before working with Argento again for 1977's Suspiria. Other film soundtracks and a concept album (Il Fantastico Viaggio Del Bagarozzo Mark) followed, then the score for the European version of George A. Romero's 1978 Dawn of the Dead. In both this and Suspiria's opening title sequences, they are credited as \\"The Goblins with Dario Argento\\". Tracks 1, 2 and 7 from the European version are also in the American version of the film. Despite their success, membership continued to be a revolving door. The remaining members continued to work on further soundtracks, and there was a partial reunification of three of the four band-members for Argento's Tenebrae (1982), the album was credited to the three band-members, not as Goblin. The last collaboration with Argento took place in 2001, with the film Sleepless. HistoryOliver, 1972–1975= Between 1972 and 1973, Claudio Simonetti (keyboards) and Massimo Morante (guitars), aided by Fabio Pignatelli (bass guitar) and Walter Martino (drums), recorded some demo tapes using the name Oliver. On a trip to London, while looking for contacts, the band bumped into Eddie Offord (then producer of Yes); after listening to a demo tape, the tycoon producer expressed interest and asked them to move to England. By then, Fabio Pignatelli had become a steady member, and the band found a regular drummer, Carlo Bordini, and an English lead vocalist (Clive Haynes). After many months of rehearsing, they returned to London while Offord was on tour with Yes in the US; after many performances and various attempts at striking deals with record houses, they were forced to go back to Italy, due to lack of funds. =Cherry Five= Back home, they signed with Cinevox, and Clive Haynes was replaced by Tony Tartarini who had previously recorded with L'Uovo Di Colombo under the name Toni Gionta. The band's name was changed to Cherry Five by the label, and according to Claudio Simonetti for no apparent reason, as the members themselves had intended to continue as \\"Oliver.\\" Whatever debate about the band's name there may have existed, their first LP was titled Cherry Five. Cinevox Records was active mainly in soundtrack publishing. Due to the band's peculiar sound, the band was frequently called to perform and arrange famous musicians' compositions. This helped them better understand the world of soundtracks and the particular techniques required. Their final act as Cherry Five was to drop new drummer Carlo Bordini and bring back Walter Martino on drums. =Success and film soundtracks, 1975–1978= At the beginning of 1975, the band began a cooperation with Giorgio Gaslini on the Profondo rosso film project. The band replaced Martino (who went on to join the band Libra) with Agostino Marangolo (of the band Flea on the Honey/Flea/Etna) during this period. Martino recorded on all but two cuts of Profondo rosso. By chance, after three or four days of recording, Gaslini left the film after a conflict with Dario Argento, so Argento decided to try the band's hand at composing, giving them one night to write a score, and one day to record it. To distinguish this new release from their first LP which was just about to be marketed, the band changed their name again, this time to Goblin. Their success exceeded all expectations: more than one million copies sold, enjoying 52 weeks on the Italian hit charts and ranking first in both the singles and LP categories. It launched a highly successful period for the band, which came to an end in 1978 when the band split after the recording of Dario Argento's cut of George Romero's Zombi (also known as Dawn of the Dead). (On the score for the European version of the soundtrack, they were credited as \\"The Goblins.\\") In 1976, they collaborated with Willy Brezza to compose the soundtrack to Perché si uccidono (the film was released in the US as \\"Percy is Killed\\", but this was a mis-translation and there is no character even called Percy in the film). For the only time, Goblin used the name Il Reale Impero Britannico due to the controversial subject matter of the movie (drug abuse and addiction). Willy Brezza wrote the original soundtrack, and the remaining tracks were written by the band together with Fabio Frizzi. The following year they scored the Italian crime film The Heroin Busters (La via della droga), directed by Enzo G. Castellari, and starring Fabio Testi and David Hemmings. =Fragmentation, 1978–1982= Between 1978 and 1979, the band's core musicians recruited many new members consecutively. Fabio Pignatelli, Agostino Marangolo, his brother Antonio Marangolo (a saxophonist who contributed to several albums) and nephew Carlo Pennisi (a session man who often played in place of Massimo Morante when he was absent) all worked together from 1980 to 1982 in the band, Flea on the Honey, which managed to record several LPs. Pignatelli took part in all the recordings, with Agostino Marangolo ranking lead for number of performances. The remaining members continued to work on further soundtracks, and there was a partial reunification for Argento's Tenebrae (1982) (although each member of the band was credited separately, not as Goblin). Over time, it was three of the \\"founding fathers\\" (Pignatelli, Simonetti and Morante), plus Marongolo, who became synonymous with the name Goblin. =Reunion for Sleepless soundtrack, 2000= After 22 years of hiatus, in 2000, the group reformed to score the Dario Argento thriller Non ho sonno (Sleepless). The soundtrack was a great success and showed the group could still make great music, much to their fans' delight. The group were scheduled to perform in Tarrytown, New York for the infamous Cult-Con, but failed to appear. Simonetti did however appear at the show and informed fans that old wounds resurfaced during their brief reunion. With his horror theme tribute band, Daemonia (formed by Titta Tani, Bruno Previtali, Federico Amorosi, and Simonetti himself), he performed a nine-song set from the films of Dario Argento, and Goblin later officially disbanded. =Back To The Goblin, 2005–2009=BackToTheGoblin2005 Nevertheless, in 2005, with the release of Giovanni Aloisio's official Goblin biography and the opening of their official website, Morante and Pignatelli reformed the group once again and with Marangolo and Guarini recorded the album BackToTheGoblin2005 under the independent label BackToTheFudda. The album was available only through the official site and was not distributed in regular stores. It is also available on iTunes. 2009 reunion tour In 2009, Goblin, now Back To The Goblin, made their first live concert appearance in 32 years. Keyboardist Aidan Zammit has joined the band for their live performances. Excluding Simonetti, this is basically the \\"classic\\" line-up, with Maurizio Guarini contributing keyboard work to most of their original albums, playing on Roller, Chi?, Suspiria, Buio Omega, Patrick, Contamination, St. Helens, Notturno, Volo, BackToTheGoblin and more. The five members (Morante, Guarini, Pignatelli, Marangolo, and Aidan Zammit) performed a few concerts around Europe in 2009: *Donaufestival in Krems, Austria on 23 April 2009 *La villette sonique in Paris - 29 May *Dancity Festival at the Auditorium San Domenico - Foligno - 25 June *Supersonic Festival in Birmingham, UK - 26 July *Scala, London - 27 July In December 2009, Back to the Goblin once again announced their dissolution due to internal conflict. The remaining scheduled concerts into 2010 were then canceled. =New Goblin/Goblin Rebirth and the Goblin Keys, 2010–present= New Goblin were scheduled to perform at Unsound Festival Kraków on 23 October 2010, consisting of Claudio Simonetti in the line-up, as well as Morante, Guarini, Bruno Previtali and Titta Tani. Essentially, it was three members of the classic lineup and two members of Simonetti's other band, Daemonia (Previtali and Tani being the bassist and drummer, respectively, of that band). Yet another incarnation of the band, formed in December 2010 and called Goblin Rebirth, includes former Goblin members Fabio Pignatelli and Agostino Marangolo plus Giacomo Anselmi on guitars, Aidan Zammit and Danilo Cherni on keyboards. In 2011, the monumental 450-page book, Goblin sette note in rosso (Goblin seven notes in red) was released, written by Fabio Capuzzo. It traces the full history of Goblin from 1973 to 2011 with a detailed analysis of all the albums and movies with music performed by Goblin (including all the works as session musicians). It also details full biographies, exclusive interviews and contains discographies and filmographies of the Italian composers who created scores for police, giallo and horror movies, and information about all the Italian rock bands with a role in movie soundtracks. In 2011/2012 New Goblin (Morante, Guarini, Simonetti, Previtali and Tani) had an intense live activity around the world, including Japan (twice), Australia (twice) and New Zealand. In April 2012, Claudio Simonetti and now-Greater Toronto based Maurizio Guarini performed with drummer Bob Scott and guitarist Chris Gartner, in Shock Stock 2012 on 14 April 2012 as The Goblin Keys. On 24 June 2013, the New Goblin line-up announced their first-ever North American tour and under their original banner, Goblin, played 17 dates in October 2013, with Secret Chiefs 3 as the opening act. =Tour and Simonetti's Goblin, 2013–present= Simonetti has since formed another incarnation of the band called Claudio Simonetti's Goblin, which features him and the other members of his horror film theme cover group Daemonia. In February 2014 they began touring and playing complete scores live during screenings of the films Deep Red, Suspiria and Dawn of the Dead. In April 2014, the band was slated to tour, performing the score to Dawn of the Dead live throughout North America, but in July the tour was canceled. In June 2014 Claudio Simonetti's Goblin released an album titled The Murder Collection, consisting of new, but faithful, versions of some of Goblin and Simonetti's most well-known compositions. =4/5 of Original Goblin members reunion, Live and Studio activity, 2013–present= Goblin returned for a second US tour leg in December 2013 with Simonetti, Bruno Previtali and Titta Tani being replaced by original members Fabio Pignatelli and Agostino Marangolo and additional keyboard player Aidan Zammit. The reunited band played 13 dates mostly in Midwest US. In April and May 2014 Goblin returned in US for the third time. Aidan Zammit was replaced by Steve Moore of the band Zombi and Goblin played nine dates throughout the southern United States. In October 2014 Massimo Morante, Maurizio Guarini, Fabio Pignatelli and Agostino Marangolo announced that, as Goblin, they released an album of new material titled Four of a Kind and started a crowdfunding campaign through the website pledgemusic.com to help complete it. In June 2015 Goblin Rebirth released their self-titled debut album and did various live appearances. Also in 2015, Cherry Five reformed with original members Carlo Bordini and Tony Tartarini along with new members Ludovico Piccinini (guitars), Gianluca De Rossi (keyboards) and Pino Sallusti (bass) and released an album titled \\"Il Pozzo dei Giganti\\". On 3 April 2017. bassist Pino Sallusti died. In the spring of 2017, Goblin (Morante, Guarini, Pignatelli, Marangolo with Aidan Zammit) resumed live performance with three concerts in Europe: Sweden, Norway and Greece. From 26 October 2017 through 12 November, Goblin toured North America on their 'Sound of Fear' tour with 13 dates in US and 2 in Canada. In October 2017 the US publishing house Ajna has published Fabio Capuzzo’s ‘Goblin Seven Notes in Red’, the full revised and updated English version of the Italian book ‘Goblin sette note in rosso’: \\"This lavishly illustrated, gorgeous and nearly 600-page tome on one of the most fascinating prog rock bands in the world (…) belongs in the hands of every Goblin/Dario Argento fan (…). The book is chock full with an overwhelming amount of information. If there is an anecdote about Goblin that you are looking for, I would be shocked if you can’t find it in these pages. If you love Goblin, this book is a no-brainer. It’s superb.\\" In May 2018 Goblin are present on the debut full-length Princess album with a new song called \\"God Save the Goblin\\" (Pignatelli/Wolf/Guarini/Morante/Marangolo) plus a couple of featuring (one by Fabio Pignatelli and another by Tony Tartarini). Goblin appeared at the Psycho Las Vegas on 19 August 2018. A new Goblin album \\"Fearless\\" was released at the end of 2018. Style and influences AllMusic's review of Goblin's soundtrack for Deep Red describes the score as \\"an ambitious affair that blends jazz, prog rock, and heavy metal into an effective and totally distinctive style\\"AllMusic and the track \\"Deep Shadows\\" as \\"a frenetic slice of King Crimson-style jazz-rock\\". Influences cited by Goblin include Yes, Genesis, King Crimson, Gentle Giant and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. The band Zombi was influenced by Goblin. The band Opeth included an instrumental titled \\"Goblin\\" on their eleventh album, Pale Communion, in tribute to the band.

In this context, in 2019, the 3rd Special Gendarmes Battalion for Intervention, Special Actions and Protection was created. The selection of specialists for the 3rd Battalion Special Gendarmes for Intervention, Special Actions and Protection is a very rigorous one and includes elements that can test the upper limits of the fighters, from a physical and mental point of view. The further training of the fighters is one focused on the execution of the main categories of missions and specialization in the pyrotechnic and sniper fields, specific to the unit. Battalion 3 fighters are trained to act punctually, in small teams, with a high level of operational autonomy, in missions with a high degree of complexity. The equipment and armament of the 3rd Battalion are adapted to the missions performed and meant to confer a high response capacity.

Cowherd began his broadcasting career as sports director of Las Vegas television station KVBC and as a sports anchor on several other stations before joining ESPN in 2003, where he hosted a radio show on the ESPN Radio network and also became one of the original hosts of ESPN's television program SportsNation, as well as Colin's New Football Show. Cowherd is the host of The Herd with Colin Cowherd on Fox Sports Radio and Fox Sports 1. The Herd is FS1's top-rated studio program. He was also a host of Speak For Yourself on FS1. After Cowherd made a controversial statement about Dominican Republic baseball players, it was announced in July 2015 that Cowherd would leave ESPN following the end of his contract with them. In August 2015, it was revealed that he would join Fox Sports beginning in September—a deal that includes his radio show moving to Fox Sports Radio and Fox Sports 1. While scheduled to leave at the end of the month, Cowherd was suspended from ESPN on July 24, 2015 after those controversial remarks he made on The Herd the previous day. Early life and career Cowherd was born in Aberdeen, Washington. His father, Charles, was an optometrist and his British-born mother Patricia ( 2014) was a housewife who immigrated to the United States at age 14. He has an older sister named Marlene. Cowherd grew up in Grayland, Washington, a small fishing village about 130 miles away from Seattle. His parents divorced while he was young, due to his father's alcoholism, and he and his sister were raised mainly by their mother. Cowherd described himself as a loner during his childhood, spending much time sitting on his roof, listening to baseball games on the radio. Cowherd was roommates with Coach Jim McElwain (current Central Michigan University football head coach) at Eastern Washington. Cowherd began his career as the play-by-play voice for the San Diego Padres Triple-A affiliate Las Vegas Stars. He eventually became a sports director at KVBC in Las Vegas, where he was named Nevada's Sportscaster of the Year five times. He served as weekend sports anchor at WTVT in Tampa, Florida. In 1996, he moved to Portland, Oregon where he worked as a sports anchorman for KGW-TV. In 2001, The Herd moved from an afternoon time slot on all-sports radio KFXX to the morning drive time. =With ESPN Radio = Colin Cowherd during a live broadcast of his radio program on the campus of The University of Iowa in 2010 Colin Cowherd during a live broadcast of The Herd at Public House in Chicago, Illinois on July 30, 2014 In 2003, Cowherd was selected to replace Tony Kornheiser for the late-morning time slot (10 AM – 1 PM ET) on ESPN Radio. Cowherd's show, The Herd with Colin Cowherd, is a syndicated talk radio show broadcast on Fox Sports Radio. From 2004 to 2015, it was transmitted to ESPN Radio affiliates throughout the United States and online at ESPNRadio.com. In 2008, the Herd added a simulcast on ESPNU. The show features commentary on sports news, perspective on other news stories, and interviews with popular analysts and sports figures. Although a sports broadcast, he often reflects on personal life and business as it relates to the sports world. Demographics and regional preferences are frequent topics of his program. The majority of his conversations primarily center around the National Football League (NFL), college football, and the National Basketball Association (NBA). He, Michelle Beadle, and later Charissa Thompson co-hosted the TV show SportsNation on ESPN2 from 2009 to 2012; the show debuted on July 6, 2009. SportsNation was designed to take \\"the pulse\\" of the nation. Cowherd and Thompson were given two choices to select from and they attempted to determine which choice was the audience's favorite (e.g., Who is more likely to haunt someone when they die, Kobe Bryant or Joe Paterno?). Cowherd announced in September 2012 that he would be leaving the program; his last month as host was December 2012. Marcellus Wiley took over for Cowherd in January 2013. In fall 2013, Cowherd began hosting the ESPN Sunday morning pro and college football talk show Colin's New Football Show.Colin's new football show debuts September 8, September 2013; accessed November 28, 2014. In 2013, Cowherd's first book, You Herd Me! I'll Say It If Nobody Else Will, was published.\\"You Herd Me!\\" Kirkus Review (November 19, 2013) Cowherd has said on his radio show that he had been writing the book on-and-off for a few years. In 2015, Cowherd released his second book, Raw: My 100%, Grade-A, Unfiltered, Inside Look at Sports. = With Fox Sports = On July 1, 2015, it was announced that Cowherd would leave ESPN. Network president John Skipper stated that Cowherd's presence had been \\"mutually beneficial\\", going on to say that \\"he came to national prominence on ESPN with his unique perspective on sports and society. Endings also bring new beginnings, for ESPN and Colin, and we thank him and wish him the best.\\" Multiple sources reported that Cowherd was in talks with Fox Sports; Jamie Horowitz, a Fox Sports executive, previously worked for ESPN as a producer for Cowherd. Cowherd's final broadcast aired on July 24, 2015. Although his contract was originally scheduled to end a week later on July 31, Cowherd was released earlier following controversial remarks he made regarding Dominican baseball players during the previous day's edition of The Herd. On August 12, 2015, it was officially announced that Cowherd would join Fox Sports with a four-year deal. The Herd moved to Premiere Networks and Fox Sports Radio on September 8, 2015, and its TV simulcast moved to Fox Sports 1. Kristine Leahy was the co-host and newswoman. Joy Taylor replaced Leahy in 2018. Cowherd also serves as a contributor to Fox NFL Kickoff. Cowherd was also the co-host on daily sports talk show Speak for Yourself with Cowherd & Whitlock on Fox Sports 1 with Jason Whitlock. Controversy and criticismRemarks on professional wrestling= In November 2005, ESPN apologized following a number of complaints about comments made by Cowherd on the death of professional wrestler Eddie Guerrero on the November 13, 2005 edition of The Herd. Cowherd had reportedly commented \\"who cares that he died\\" and described his death as \\"not newsworthy\\" before speculating on the cause of death. He was later reprimanded by ESPN Radio general manager Bruce Gilbert over his remarks. Cowherd again drew criticism in April 2014 with remarks on the death of The Ultimate Warrior. In March 2018, Cowherd - who had previously referred to professional wrestling fans as \\"lonely, pathetic Booger Eaters\\" \\\\- attended the taping of an episode of WWE SmackDown. = The Big Lead = On the April 5, 2007, edition of The Herd, Cowherd directed his listeners to \\"blow up\\" the sports blog The Big Lead by simultaneously visiting its home page. The site was unable to handle the influx in traffic, and the site was knocked offline for approximately 96 hours. ESPN's new Ombudsman, LeAnne Schreiber, wrote an article sharing her negative opinion of Cowherd's actions. Schreiber contacted Traug Keller, a Senior Vice President at ESPN Radio, and Keller indicated that Cowherd would face no disciplinary action for the stunt, because there had been no policy against such a tactic at the time. To prevent this from happening again, Keller instituted a zero tolerance policy of such activities in the future. =Sean Taylor remarks = Cowherd was criticized for comments he made regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of Sean Taylor. On November 28, 2007, one day after Taylor's home invasion murder, Cowherd claimed that Taylor's past had brought this on him and that Redskins fans who mourned him were not \\"grown-ups\\". He stated about Taylor's turnaround: \\"Well yeah, just because you clean the rug doesn't mean you got everything out. Sometimes you've got stains, stuff so deep it never ever leaves.\\" Taylor's death was later found to be the result of a botched robbery and the robbers hadn't known Taylor was home when they entered. = Dominican Republic baseball remarks = On July 23, 2015, Cowherd made remarks connecting the number of baseball players from the Dominican Republic to the game's alleged simplicity. The observation that the Dominican Republic \\"has not been known in my lifetime as having world class academic abilities\\", because \\"a lot of those kids come from rough backgrounds and have not had opportunities academically that other kids from other countries have.\\" The remarks drew the ire of some Dominican players, such as José Bautista, and of the MLB Players Association; later that day, USA Today reported that the MLBPA was considering the possibility of \\"withholding cooperation\\" with ESPN and Fox over their lack of reaction to the remarks. Major League Baseball also condemned Cowherd for making remarks they felt were \\"inappropriate, offensive and completely inconsistent with the values of our game.\\" The following day, ESPN announced that it would immediately cut ties with Cowherd in response to the remarks. During the final episode of The Herd, Cowherd presented statistics from several studies regarding the current state of education in the Dominican Republic. He went on to say that \\"I could've said a third of baseball's talent is being furnished from countries with economic hardships, therefore educational hurdles. For the record, I used the Dominican Republic because they've furnished baseball with so many great players.\\" Cowherd apologized, though the apology was not well received.

He was the only ruler of this dynasty whose tomb was not plundered by tomb robbers. His final resting place was discovered within an antechamber of Psusennes I's tomb at Tanis by Pierre Montet in 1939. Montet removed the coffin lid of Shoshenq II on March 20, 1939, in the presence of king Farouk of Egypt himself.Bob Brier, Egyptian Mummies: Unravelling the Secrets of an Ancient Art, William Morrow & Company Inc., New York, 1994. p.145 It proved to contain many jewel-encrusted bracelets and pectorals, along with a beautiful hawkheaded silver coffin and a gold funerary mask.Sheshonq II The facemask had been placed upon the head of the king.Brier, p.144 Montet later discovered the intact tombs of two Twenty-first Dynasty kings (Psusennes I and Amenemope) a year later in February and April 1940 respectively. Shoshenq II's prenomen, Heqakheperre Setepenre, means \\"The manifestation of Ra rules, the chosen one of Ra.\\"Peter A. Clayton, Chronicle of the Pharaohs: The Reign-by-Reign Record of the Rulers and Dynasties of Ancient Egypt, Thames and Hudson, London, 1994. p.185 Shoshenq II's enigmatic identity There is a small possibility that Shoshenq II was the son of Shoshenq I. Two bracelets from Shoshenq II's tomb mention king Shoshenq I while a pectoral was inscribed with the title 'Great Chief of the Ma Shoshenq,' a title which Shoshenq I employed under Psusennes II before he became king.Kenneth A. Kitchen, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100–650 BC), 3rd edition: 1996, Aris & Phillips Ltd., p.117 These items may be interpreted as either evidence of a possible filial link between the two men or just mere heirlooms. A high degree of academic uncertainty regarding the parentage of this king exists: some scholars today contend that Shoshenq II was actually a younger son of Shoshenq I—who outlived Osorkon I and Takelot I—due to the discovery of the aforementioned items naming the founder of the 22nd Dynasty within his intact royal Tanite tomb. As the German Egyptologist Karl Jansen-Winkeln observes in the recent (2005) book on Egyptian chronology: \\"The commonly assumed identification of this king with the (earlier) HP and son of Osorkon I [by KA Kitchen] does not appear to be very probable.\\"Karl Jansen-Winkeln, The Chronology of the Third Intermediate Period: Dyns 22-24 in 'Handbook of Egyptian Chronology,' ed. Rolf Krauss, Erik Hornung, David Warburton, Brill: 2005, p.237 A forensic examination of Shoshenq II's body by Dr. Douglas Derry, the head of Cairo Museum's anatomy department, reveals that he was a man in his fifties when he died.Douglas E. Derry, Note on the Remains of Shashanq, Annales du Service des Antiquités de l’Égypte 39 (1939), pp.549-551 Hence, Shoshenq II could have easily survived Osorkon I's 35-year reign and ruled Egypt for a few years before Takelot I came to power. Moreover, Sextus Julius Africanus's generally more accurate copy of Manetho's Epitome explicitly states that “3 Kings” intervened between Osorkon I and Takelot I.Jürgen von Beckerath, Chronologie des Pharaonischen Ägypten, Philipp von Zabern: Mainz am Rhein, (1997), pp.95 While Manetho's suggested position for these three kings cannot be presently verified due to the paucity of evidence for this period and the brevity of their reigns, another of these poorly known monarchs would be Tutkheperre Shoshenq who was an early Dynasty 22 ruler since he is now monumentally attested in both Lower and Upper Egypt at Bubastis and Abydos respectively.Eva R. Lange, Ein Neuer König Schoschenk in Bubastis, Göttinger Miszellen 203 (2004), pp.65–72 Evidence that Shoshenq II was a predecessor of Osorkon II is indicated by the fact that his hawk-headed coffin is stylistically similar to \\"a hawk-headed lid\\" which enclosed the granite coffin of king Harsiese A, from Medinet Habu.Aidan M. Dodson, The Canopic Equipment of the Kings of Egypt, Kegan Paul Intl: London, 1994. pp.90 & 92 Harsiese A was an early contemporary of Osorkon II and likely Takelot I too since the latter did not firmly control Upper Egypt in his reign. This implies that Shoshenq II and Harsiese A were near contemporaries since Harsiese A was the son of the High Priest of Amun Shoshenq C at Thebes and, thus, the grandson of Osorkon I. Harsiese's funerary evidence places Shoshenq II roughly one or two generations after Osorkon I and may date him to the brief interval between Takelot I and Osorkon I at Tanis.J. von Beckerath, p.98 In this case, the objects naming Shoshenq I in this king's tomb would simply be heirlooms, rather than proof of an actual filial relation between Shoshenq I and II. This latter interpretation is endorsed by Jürgen von Beckerath, in his 1997 book, Chronologie des Pharaonischen Ägypten who believes Shoshenq II was actually an elder brother of Takelot I. The view that Shoshenq II was an elder brother of Takelot I is also endorsed by Norbert Dautzenberg in a GM 144 paper.Norbert Dautzenberg, Bemerkungen zu Schoschenq II., Takeloth II. und Pedubastis II., Göttinger Miszellen 144 (1995), pp.21-29 Von Beckerath, however, places Shoshenq II between the reigns of Takelot I and Osorkon II at Tanis.J. von Beckerath, pp.98 & 191 Kenneth Kitchen, in his latest 1996 edition of '’The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (c.1100–650 BC)’', maintains that Shoshenq II was the High Priest of Amun Shoshenq C, son of Osorkon I and Queen Maatkare, who was appointed as the junior coregent to the throne but predeceased his father.Kitchen, pp.117–119 Kitchen suggests such a coregency is reflected on the bandages of the Ramesseum mummy of Nakhtefmut, which contain the dates \\"Year 3 [Blank]\\" and \\"Year 33 Second Heb Sed\\" respectively.Kitchen, p.110 The “Year 33” date mentioned here almost certainly refers to Osorkon I since Nakhtefmut wore a ring which bore this king's prenomen. Kitchen infers from this evidence that Year 33 of Osorkon I is equivalent to Year 3 of Shoshenq II, and that the latter was Shoshenq C himself.Kitchen, p.308 Unfortunately, however, the case for a coregency between Osorkon I and Shoshenq II is uncertain because there is no clear evidence that the Year 3 and Year 33 bandages on Naktefmut's body were made at the same time. These two dates were not written on a single piece of mummy linen—which would denote a true coregency. Rather, the dates were written on two separate and unconnected mummy bandages which were likely woven and used over a period of several years, as the burial practices of the Amun priests show. A prime example is the Mummy of Khonsmaakheru in Hamburg which contains separate bandages dating to Years 11, 12, and 23 of Osorkon I—or a minimum period of 12 Years between their creation and final use. (Altenmüller: 2000) A second example is the mummy of Djedptahiufankh, the Third or Fourth Prophet of Amun, which bears various bandages from Years 5, 10, and 11 of Shoshenq I, or a spread of six years in their final use for embalming purposes. As these two near contemporary examples show, the temple priests simply reused whatever old or recycled linens which they could gain access to for their mummification rituals. The Year 3 mummy linen would, hence, belong to the reign of Osorkon's successor. Secondly, none of the High Priest Shoshenq C's own children—the priest Osorkon whose funerary papyrus, P. Denon C, is located in the Russian National Library in St. Petersburg or a second priest named Harsiese (likely king Harsiese A) who dedicated a Bes statue in memory of his father, now in Durham Museum—give royal titles to their father on their own funerary objects. The priest Osorkon only calls himself the \\"son of the High Priest Shoshenq\\", rather than the title \\"King's Son\\" in his funerary papyri, which would presumably have been created long after his father's death.Helen Jacquet- Gordon, book review of KA Kitchen's The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100–650 B.C.), Bibliotheca Orientalis 32 (1975), pp.358–359 On Harsiese, Jacquet-Gordon notes that \\"there is no good evidence to suggest that the 1st prophet Shoshenq C ever claimed or was accorded royal rank.\\"Jacquet-Gordon, pp.358–360 She observes that Harsiese designated his father as a High Priest of Amun on a Bes statue without any accompanying royal name or prenomen and stresses that if Shoshenq C \\"had [even] the slightest pretensions to royal rank, his son would not have omitted to mention this fact. We must therefore conclude that he had no such pretensions.\\"Jacquet-Gordon, p.35Kitchen, p.117 This implies that the High Priest Shoshenq C was not king Shoshenq II. While Shoshenq C's name is indeed written in a cartouche on the Bes statue, no actual royal name or prenomen is ever given. An example of a king's son who enclosed his name in a cartouche on a monument but never inherited the throne was Wadjmose, a son of the New Kingdom king Thutmose I. Independent reign Pectoral of Shoshenq II. More significantly, Shoshenq II's intact burial did not contain a single object or heirloom naming Osorkon I—an unlikely situation if Osorkon did indeed bury his own son. Kitchen notes that this king's burial goods included a pectoral that was originally inscribed for the Great Chief of the Ma Shoshenq I—before the latter became king—and \\"a pair of bracellets of Shoshenq I as king but no later objects.\\"Kitchen, pp.117–118 This situation appears improbable if Shoshenq II was indeed Shoshenq C, Osorkon I's son who died and was buried by his own father. Other Dynasty 21 and 22 kings such as Amenemope and Takelot I, for instance, employed grave goods which mentioned their parent's names in their own tombs. This suggests that Heqakheperre Shoshenq II was not a son of Osorkon I but someone else's son, perhaps Shoshenq I. Karl Jansen-Winkeln writes in the most recent book on Egyptian chronology that: : As the individuals interred in the [Tanite] royal tombs often bore objects belonging to their parents, this king (Shoshenq II) is probably a son of Shoshenq I. Since this pharaoh's funerary objects such as his silver coffin, jewel pectorals, and cartonnage all give him the unique royal name Heqakheperre, he was most likely a genuine king of the 22nd Dynasty in his own right, and not just a minor coregent. Jürgen von Beckerath adopts this interpretation of the evidence and assigns Shoshenq II an independent reign of 2 years at Tanis. In their 2005 academic publication on Egyptian chronology, the Egyptologists Rolf Krauss and David Alan Warburton also ascribed Shoshenq II an independent reign of between 1 to 2 years in the 22nd dynasty although they place Shoshenq II's brief reign between that of Takelot I and Osorkon II.Rolf Krauss & David A. Warburton, Chronological Table for the Dynastic Period in 'Handbook of Egyptian Chronology,' ed. Rolf Krauss, Erik Hornung, David Warburton, Brill: 2005, p.493 The German Egyptologist Thomas Schneider, in a 2010 paper, has accepted the validity of the reference in Manetho's epitome to the \\"3 [Tanite] kings\\" from Africanus' version and placed the reigns of both Shoshenq II and Tutkheperre Shoshenq in the interval between Osorkon I and Takelot I.Thomas Schneider, Contributions to the Chronology of the New Kingdom and the Third Intermediate Period, Aegypte und Levante 20 (2010) p.403 The exclusive use of silver for the creation of Shoshenq II's coffin is a potent symbol of his power because silver \\"was considerably rarer in Egypt than gold.\\"Christine Hobson, Exploring the World of the Pharaohs: A complete Guide to Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson 1987. p.123 Death and burial View of tomb NRT III showing where Shoshenq II was buried and discovered Dr. Derry's medical examination of Shoshenq II's mummy reveals that the king died as a result of a massive septic infection from a head wound.Derry, pp.549–551 The final resting place of Shoshenq II was certainly a reburial because he was found interred in the tomb of another king, Psusennes I of the Twenty-first Dynasty. Scientists have found evidence of plant growth on the base of Shoshenq II's coffin, which suggests that Shoshenq II's original tomb had become waterlogged,Derry, pp.549-551 hence a need to rebury him and his funerary equipment in another tomb.

He was a fellow of St John's College, University of Oxford and President of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies. His most important works include a study of Roman citizenship based on his doctoral thesis, a treatment of the New Testament from the point of view of Roman law and society, and a commentary on the letters of Pliny the Younger. Biography Adrian Nicholas Sherwin-White was born on 10 August 1911. His father, H. N. Sherwin-White, was a solicitor employed by the London County Council. From 1923 to 1930 he was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, apart from one year in which ill health forced him to study independently at home. He won a scholarship to the School's \\"sister foundation\\" St John's College, Oxford, where he began the Literae Humaniores course in 1930. His tutor in ancient history was the well-known Hugh Last, whose interest in Roman administrative history influenced the direction of his student's later scholarship. Sherwin-White achieved first-class honours in both sets of Oxford examinations, the preliminary Honour Moderations and the more important Finals which he sat in 1934. Sherwin-White started work the same year on his doctoral thesis, on Roman citizenship. In 1935, he was awarded the Derby Scholarship and Arnold Historical Essay Prize. In 1936, he married Marie Leonora Downes. He was also selected ahead of older competitors to succeed to Last's fellowship at St John's College, despite not yet having a doctorate - this may have been at Last's recommendation. His thesis was submitted in 1937, and the examiners M. Cary and R. Syme commended its \\"maturity of judgement such as one hardly dares to expect from a young scholar\\". Sherwin-White declined to accept the actual doctorate, preferring to remain known as \\"Mr\\", but he revised the thesis for publication as The Roman Citizenship (1939). It came to be regarded as \\"a classic of modern historical writing on Rome\\". Sherwin-White's poor eyesight kept him from active service during World War II, but the President of St John's wrote to the Director of Naval Intelligence to recommend him for a post, and he was commissioned on 4 December 1941 as a Temporary Sub- Lieutenant. He helped to edit some of the Admiralty's series of geographical handbooks, acquiring detailed geographical knowledge that he displayed in subsequent scholarship including a 1944 article about the historical geography of Algeria. Sherwin-White returned after the War to teaching at St John's, where he also served as \\"Keeper of the Groves\\" responsible for the college garden. Outside recognition came in 1956 with his election as a fellow of the British Academy. He produced a school textbook, Ancient Rome (1959), as well as more advanced works including Roman Society and Roman Law in the New Testament (1963), identified retrospectively by the Roman historian Fergus Millar as \\"[t]he most stimulating and original\\" of his postwar works. Arising from his studies of Roman law and administration, this indicated \\"his conviction of the essential historicity of the narratives in the New Testament\\", especially in the critique he mounted in his closing pages against \\"form-criticism of the extremer sort\\". Sherwin-White's Oxford career was not interrupted by his family's move in 1963 to a cottage near Fyfield, Oxfordshire. 1966 saw the publication of a work \\"at least eighteen years\\" in the making: his historical and social commentary on the letters of Pliny the Younger, the first such work ever compiled and one not yet replaced. In Millar's assessment, it \\"combined immense erudition, percipience and sharpness of vision with a curious slapdashness about small details\\"; these errors were keenly hunted down by contemporary reviewers. In the same year Sherwin-White became Reader in Ancient History; although he was a potential choice to succeed Ronald Syme as Camden Professor of Ancient History in 1970, this role went to Peter Brunt. Sherwin-White did serve as President of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies between 1974 and 1977, and his Roman Foreign Policy in the East (1983) appeared four years into his retirement. He died on 1 November 1993 at Fyfield, survived by his wife and two children.

Sherwin-White"},{"id":"2468892","text":"In mathematics, Newton's identities, also known as the Girard-Newton formulae, give relations between two types of symmetric polynomials, namely between power sums and elementary symmetric polynomials. Evaluated at the roots of a monic polynomial P in one variable, they allow expressing the sums of the k-th powers of all roots of P (counted with their multiplicity) in terms of the coefficients of P, without actually finding those roots. These identities were found by Isaac Newton around 1666, apparently in ignorance of earlier work (1629) by Albert Girard. They have applications in many areas of mathematics, including Galois theory, invariant theory, group theory, combinatorics, as well as further applications outside mathematics, including general relativity.  Mathematical statement  Formulation in terms of symmetric polynomials = Let x1, ..., xn be variables, denote for k ≥ 1 by pk(x1, ..., xn) the k-th power sum: : p_k(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n)=\\\\sum olimits_{i=1}^nx_i^k = x_1^k+\\\\cdots+x_n^k, and for k ≥ 0 denote by ek(x1, ..., xn) the elementary symmetric polynomial (that is, the sum of all distinct products of k distinct variables), so : \\\\begin{align} e_0(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) &= 1, e_1(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) &= x_1 + x_2 + \\\\cdots + x_n, e_2(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) &= \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{1\\\\leq in. \\\\end{align} Then Newton's identities can be stated as : ke_k(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^k(-1)^{i-1} e_{k - i} (x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) p_i(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n), valid for all n ≥ 1 and n ≥k ≥ 1\\\\. Also, one has : 0 = \\\\sum_{i=k-n}^k(-1)^{i-1} e_{k - i} (x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) p_i(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n), for all k > n ≥ 1\\\\. Concretely, one gets for the first few values of k: : \\\\begin{align} e_1(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) &= p_1(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n), 2e_2(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) &= e_1(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n)p_1(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) - p_2(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n), 3e_3(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) &= e_2(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n)p_1(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) - e_1(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n)p_2(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) + p_3(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n). \\\\end{align} The form and validity of these equations do not depend on the number n of variables (although the point where the left- hand side becomes 0 does, namely after the n-th identity), which makes it possible to state them as identities in the ring of symmetric functions. In that ring one has :\\\\begin{align} e_1 &= p_1, 2e_2 &= e_1p_1-p_2 = p_1^2-p_2, 3e_3 &= e_2p_1 - e_1p_2 + p_3 = \\\\tfrac12 p_1^3-\\\\tfrac32p_1p_2+p_3, 4e_4 &= e_3p_1 - e_2p_2 + e_1p_3 - p_4 = \\\\tfrac16p_1^4 - p_1^2p_2 + \\\\tfrac43p_1p_3+\\\\tfrac12p_2^2-p_4, \\\\end{align} and so on; here the left-hand sides never become zero. These equations allow to recursively express the ei in terms of the pk; to be able to do the inverse, one may rewrite them as :\\\\begin{align} p_1 &= e_1, p_2 &= e_1p_1-2e_2 = e_1^2 - 2e_2, p_3 &= e_1p_2 - e_2p_1 + 3e_3 = e_1^3-3e_1e_2+3e_3, p_4 &= e_1p_3 - e_2p_2 + e_3p_1 - 4e_4 = e_1^4-4e_1^2e_2+4e_1e_3+2e_2^2-4e_4,  & {}\\\\ \\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\end{align} In general, we have : p_k(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) = (-1)^{k-1}ke_k(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n)+\\\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}(-1)^{k-1+i} e_{k - i} (x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) p_i(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n), valid for all n ≥ 1 and n ≥k ≥ 1\\\\. Also, one has : p_k(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) = \\\\sum_{i=k-n}^{k-1}(-1)^{k-1+i} e_{k - i} (x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) p_i(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n), for all k > n ≥ 1\\\\. = Application to the roots of a polynomial = The polynomial with roots xi may be expanded as : \\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\left( x - x_i \\\\right) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k} e_{k} x^{n-k}, where the coefficients e_k(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) are the symmetric polynomials defined above. Given the power sums of the roots : p_k(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n)= \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^k, the coefficients of the polynomial with roots x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n may be expressed recursively in terms of the power sums as :\\\\begin{align} e_0 &= 1,\\\\[4pt] -e_1 &=-p_1,\\\\[4pt] e_2 &= \\\\frac{1}{2}(e_1 p_1 - p_2),\\\\[4pt] -e_3 &=-\\\\frac{1}{3}(e_2 p_1 - e_1 p_2 + p_3),\\\\[4pt] e_4 &= \\\\frac{1}{4}(e_3 p_1 - e_2 p_2 + e_1 p_3 - p_4),  & {} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\end{align} Formulating polynomials in this way is useful in using the method of Delves and Lyness to find the zeros of an analytic function. = Application to the characteristic polynomial of a matrix = When the polynomial above is the characteristic polynomial of a matrix A (in particular when A is the companion matrix of the polynomial), the roots x_i are the eigenvalues of the matrix, counted with their algebraic multiplicity. For any positive integer k, the matrix Ak has as eigenvalues the powers xik, and each eigenvalue x_i of A contributes its multiplicity to that of the eigenvalue xik of Ak. Then the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of Ak are given by the elementary symmetric polynomials in those powers xik. In particular, the sum of the xik, which is the k-th power sum pk of the roots of the characteristic polynomial of A, is given by its trace: :p_k = \\\\operatorname{tr} ( A^k )\\\\,. The Newton identities now relate the traces of the powers Ak to the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of A. Using them in reverse to express the elementary symmetric polynomials in terms of the power sums, they can be used to find the characteristic polynomial by computing only the powers Ak and their traces. This computation requires computing the traces of matrix powers Ak and solving a triangular system of equations. Both can be done in complexity class NC (solving a triangular system can be done by divide-and-conquer). Therefore, characteristic polynomial of a matrix can be computed in NC. By the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, every matrix satisfies its characteristic polynomial, and a simple transformation allows to find the adjugate matrix in NC. Rearranging the computations into an efficient form leads to the Faddeev-LeVerrier algorithm (1840), a fast parallel implementation of it is due to L. Csanky (1976). Its disadvantage is that it requires division by integers, so in general the field should have characteristic, 0. = Relation with Galois theory = For a given n, the elementary symmetric polynomials ek(x1,...,xn) for k = 1,..., n form an algebraic basis for the space of symmetric polynomials in x1,.... xn: every polynomial expression in the xi that is invariant under all permutations of those variables is given by a polynomial expression in those elementary symmetric polynomials, and this expression is unique up to equivalence of polynomial expressions. This is a general fact known as the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials, and Newton's identities provide explicit formulae in the case of power sum symmetric polynomials. Applied to the monic polynomial \\\\textstyle t^n+\\\\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k} a_k t^{n-k} with all coefficients ak considered as free parameters, this means that every symmetric polynomial expression S(x1,...,xn) in its roots can be expressed instead as a polynomial expression P(a1,...,an) in terms of its coefficients only, in other words without requiring knowledge of the roots. This fact also follows from general considerations in Galois theory (one views the ak as elements of a base field with roots in an extension field whose Galois group permutes them according to the full symmetric group, and the field fixed under all elements of the Galois group is the base field). The Newton identities also permit expressing the elementary symmetric polynomials in terms of the power sum symmetric polynomials, showing that any symmetric polynomial can also be expressed in the power sums. In fact the first n power sums also form an algebraic basis for the space of symmetric polynomials.  Related identities  There are a number of (families of) identities that, while they should be distinguished from Newton's identities, are very closely related to them. = A variant using complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials = Denoting by hk the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial that is the sum of all monomials of degree k, the power sum polynomials also satisfy identities similar to Newton's identities, but not involving any minus signs. Expressed as identities of in the ring of symmetric functions, they read :kh_k = \\\\sum_{i=1}^kh_{k-i}p_i, valid for all n ≥ k ≥ 1\\\\. Contrary to Newton's identities, the left-hand sides do not become zero for large k, and the right- hand sides contain ever more non-zero terms. For the first few values of k, one has :\\\\begin{align} h_1 &= p_1, 2h_2 &= h_1p_1 + p_2, 3h_3 &= h_2p_1 + h_1p_2 + p_3. \\\\end{align} These relations can be justified by an argument analogous to the one by comparing coefficients in power series given above, based in this case on the generating function identity :\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty h_k(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n)t^k = \\\\prod_{i=1}^n\\\\frac1{1 - X_it}. Proofs of Newton's identities, like these given below, cannot be easily adapted to prove these variants of those identities. = Expressing elementary symmetric polynomials in terms of power sums = As mentioned, Newton's identities can be used to recursively express elementary symmetric polynomials in terms of power sums. Doing so requires the introduction of integer denominators, so it can be done in the ring ΛQ of symmetric functions with rational coefficients: :\\\\begin{align} e_1 &= p_1, e_2 &= \\\\textstyle\\\\frac12p_1^2 - \\\\frac12p_2 &&= \\\\textstyle\\\\frac12 ( p_1^2 - p_2 ), e_3 &= \\\\textstyle\\\\frac16p_1^3 - \\\\frac12p_1 p_2 + \\\\frac13p_3 &&= \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{1}{6} ( p_1^3 - 3 p_1 p_2 + 2 p_3 ), e_4 &= \\\\textstyle\\\\frac1{24}p_1^4 - \\\\frac14p_1^2 p_2 + \\\\frac18p_2^2 + \\\\frac13p_1 p_3 - \\\\frac14p_4 &&= \\\\textstyle\\\\frac1{24} ( p_1^4 - 6 p_1^2 p_2 + 3 p_2^2 + 8 p_1 p_3 - 6 p_4 ), &~~\\\\vdots e_n &= (-1)^n \\\\sum_{m_1 + 2m_2 + \\\\cdots + nm_n = n \\\\atop m_1 \\\\ge 0, \\\\ldots, m_n \\\\ge 0} \\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{(-p_i)^{m_i}}{m_i ! i^{m_i}}  \\\\end{align} and so forth.N.b., the coefficients of the weighted product terms in the sum given by the identity above are related to the M2 numbers in Section 26.4 of the DLMF and/or the coefficients involved in the expansions of Faa di Bruno's formula The general formula can be conveniently expressed as :e_n = \\\\frac{(-1)^n}{n!} B_{n}(- p_1, -1! p_2, - 2! p_3, \\\\ldots, - (n-1)! p_n ), where the Bn is the complete exponential Bell polynomial. This expression also leads to the following identity for generating functions: : \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty e_n \\\\,X^n = \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} p_n \\\\,X^n \\\\right). Applied to a monic polynomial, these formulae express the coefficients in terms of the power sums of the roots: replace each ei by ai and each pk by sk. = Expressing complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials in terms of power sums = The analogous relations involving complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials can be similarly developed, giving equations :\\\\begin{align} h_1 &= p_1, h_2 &= \\\\textstyle\\\\frac12p_1^2 + \\\\frac12p_2 &&= \\\\textstyle\\\\frac12 ( p_1^2 + p_2 ), h_3 &= \\\\textstyle\\\\frac16p_1^3 + \\\\frac12p_1 p_2 + \\\\frac13p_3 &&= \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{1}{6} ( p_1^3 + 3 p_1 p_2 + 2 p_3 ), h_4 &= \\\\textstyle\\\\frac1{24}p_1^4 + \\\\frac14p_1^2 p_2 + \\\\frac18p_2^2 + \\\\frac13p_1 p_3 + \\\\frac14p_4 &&= \\\\textstyle\\\\frac1{24} ( p_1^4 + 6 p_1^2 p_2 + 3 p_2^2 + 8 p_1 p_3 + 6 p_4 ), &~~\\\\vdots h_n &= \\\\sum_{m_1 + 2m_2 + \\\\cdots + nm_n = n \\\\atop m_1\\\\ge 0, \\\\ldots, m_n\\\\ge 0} \\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{p_i^{m_i}}{m_i ! i^{m_i}} \\\\end{align} and so forth, in which there are only plus signs. In terms of the complete Bell polynomial, :h_n = \\\\frac{1}{n!} B_{n}(p_1, 1! p_2, 2! p_3, \\\\ldots, (n-1)! p_n ). These expressions correspond exactly to the cycle index polynomials of the symmetric groups, if one interprets the power sums pi as indeterminates: the coefficient in the expression for hk of any monomial p1m1p2m2...plml is equal to the fraction of all permutations of k that have m1 fixed points, m2 cycles of length 2, ..., and ml cycles of length l. Explicitly, this coefficient can be written as 1/N where N=\\\\prod_{i=1}^l(m_i!\\\\,i^{m_i}); this N is the number permutations commuting with any given permutation of the given cycle type. The expressions for the elementary symmetric functions have coefficients with the same absolute value, but a sign equal to the sign of , namely (−1)m2+m4+.... It can be proved by considering the following inductive step: :\\\\begin{align} mf(m; m_1, \\\\ldots, m_n) &= f(m-1; m_1 - 1, \\\\ldots, m_n) + \\\\cdots + f(m - n; m_1, \\\\ldots, m_n - 1)  m_1\\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{1}{i^{m_i} m_i!} + \\\\cdots + nm_n \\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{1}{i^{m_i} m_i!} &= m\\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{1}{i^{m_i} m_i!} \\\\end{align} = Expressing power sums in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials = One may also use Newton's identities to express power sums in terms of symmetric polynomials, which does not introduce denominators: :\\\\begin{align} p_1 &= e_1, p_2 &= e_1^2 - 2 e_2, p_3 &= e_1^3 - 3 e_2 e_1 + 3 e_3, p_4 &= e_1^4 - 4 e_2 e_1^2 + 4 e_3 e_1 + 2 e_2^2 - 4 e_4, p_5 &= e_1^5 - 5 e_2 e_1^3 + 5 e_3 e_1^2 + 5 e_2^2 e_1 - 5 e_4 e_1 - 5 e_3e_2 + 5 e_5, p_6 &= e_1^6 - 6 e_2 e_1^4 + 6 e_3 e_1^3 + 9 e_2^2 e_1^2 - 6 e_4 e_1^2 - 12 e_3 e_2 e_1 + 6 e_5 e_1 - 2 e_2^3 + 3 e_3^2 + 6 e_4 e_2 - 6e_6. \\\\end{align} The first four formulas were obtained by Albert Girard in 1629 (thus before Newton). The general formula (for all non-negative integers m) is: :p_m = \\\\sum_{r_1 + 2r_2 + \\\\cdots + mr_m = m \\\\atop r_1\\\\ge 0, \\\\ldots, r_m\\\\ge 0} (-1)^m \\\\frac{m(r_1 + r_2 + \\\\cdots + r_m - 1)!}{r_1!r_2! \\\\cdots r_m!} \\\\prod_{i=1}^m (-e_i)^{r_i}. This can be conveniently stated in terms of ordinary Bell polynomials as :p_m = (-1)^m m \\\\sum_{k=1}^m \\\\frac{1}{k} \\\\hat{B}_{m,k}(-e_1,\\\\ldots,-e_{m-k+1}), or equivalently as the generating function: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{\\\\infty} (-1)^{k-1} p_k \\\\frac{t^k}{k} & = \\\\ln\\\\left(1+e_1t+e_2t^2+e_3t^3+\\\\cdots\\\\right)  & = e_1 t - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(e_1^2-2e_2\\\\right) t^2 + \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\left(e_1^3-3e_1e_2+3e_3\\\\right) t^3 + \\\\cdots, \\\\end{align} which is analogous to the Bell polynomial exponential generating function given in the previous subsection. The multiple summation formula above can be proved by considering the following inductive step: :\\\\begin{align} f(m;\\\\; r_1,\\\\ldots,r_n) = {} & f(m - 1;\\\\; r_1 - 1, \\\\cdots, r_n) + \\\\cdots + f(m - n;\\\\; r_1, \\\\ldots, r_n - 1)\\\\[8pt] = {} & \\\\frac{1}{(r_1 - 1)!\\\\cdots r_n!}(m - 1)(r_1 + \\\\cdots + r_n - 2)! + \\\\cdots  & \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{r_1!\\\\cdots(r_n - 1)!}(m - n)(r_1 + \\\\cdots + r_n - 2)!\\\\[8pt] = {} & \\\\frac{1}{r_1!\\\\cdots r_n!}\\\\left[r_1(m - 1) + \\\\cdots + r_n(m-n)\\\\right]\\\\left[r_1 + \\\\cdots + r_n - 2\\\\right]!\\\\[8pt] = {} & \\\\frac{1}{r_1!\\\\cdots r_n!}\\\\left[m(r_1 + \\\\cdots + r_n) - m\\\\right]\\\\left[r_1 + \\\\cdots + r_n - 2\\\\right]!\\\\[8pt] = {} & \\\\frac{m(r_1 + \\\\cdots + r_n - 1)!}{r_1!\\\\cdots r_n!} \\\\end{align} = Expressing power sums in terms of complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials = Finally one may use the variant identities involving complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials similarly to express power sums in term of them: :\\\\begin{align} p_1 &= + h_1, p_2 &= - h_1^2 + 2 h_2, p_3 &= + h_1^3 - 3 h_2 h_1 + 3 h_3, p_4 &= - h_1^4 + 4 h_2 h_1^2 - 4 h_3 h_1 - 2 h_2^2 + 4 h_4, p_5 &= + h_1^5 - 5 h_2 h_1^3 + 5 h_2^2 h_1 + 5 h_3 h_1^2 - 5 h_3h_2 - 5 h_4 h_1 + 5 h_5, p_6 &= - h_1^6 + 6 h_2 h_1^4 - 9 h_2^2 h_1^2 - 6 h_3 h_1^3 + 2 h_2^3 + 12 h_3 h_2 h_1 + 6 h_4 h_1^2 - 3 h_3^2 - 6 h_4 h_2 - 6 h_1 h_5 + 6h_6, \\\\end{align} and so on. Apart from the replacement of each ei by the corresponding hi, the only change with respect to the previous family of identities is in the signs of the terms, which in this case depend just on the number of factors present: the sign of the monomial \\\\Pi_{i=1}^l h_i^{m_i} is −(−1)m1+m2+m3+.... In particular the above description of the absolute value of the coefficients applies here as well. The general formula (for all non-negative integers m) is: :p_m = -\\\\sum_{r_1 + 2r_2 + \\\\cdots + mr_m = m \\\\atop r_1\\\\ge 0, \\\\ldots, r_m \\\\ge 0} \\\\frac{m(r_1 + r_2 + \\\\cdots + r_m - 1)!}{r_1!r_2!\\\\cdots r_m!} \\\\prod_{i=1}^m (-h_i)^{r_i} = Expressions as determinants = One can obtain explicit formulas for the above expressions in the form of determinants, by considering the first n of Newton's identities (or it counterparts for the complete homogeneous polynomials) as linear equations in which the elementary symmetric functions are known and the power sums are unknowns (or vice versa), and apply Cramer's rule to find the solution for the final unknown. For instance taking Newton's identities in the form :\\\\begin{align} e_1 &= 1p_1, 2e_2 &= e_1p_1 - 1p_2, 3e_3 &= e_2p_1 - e_1p_2 + 1p_3, & \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\vdots  ne_n &= e_{n-1}p_1 - e_{n-2} p_2 + \\\\cdots + (-1)^ne_1p_{n - 1} + (-1)^{n - 1}p_n \\\\end{align} we consider p_1, -p_2, p_3, \\\\ldots, (-1)^np_{n-1} and p_n as unknowns, and solve for the final one, giving :\\\\begin{align} p_n ={} &\\\\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & & e_1  e_1 & 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 2e_2  e_2 & e_1 & 1 & & 3e_3  \\\\vdots & & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots e_{n - 1} & \\\\cdots & e_2 & e_1 & ne_n \\\\end{vmatrix}\\\\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots &  e_1 & 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots  e_2 & e_1 & 1 &  \\\\vdots & & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots  e_{n - 1} & \\\\cdots & e_2 & e_1 & (-1)^{n-1} \\\\end{vmatrix}^{-1} \\\\[7pt] = {(-1)^{n-1}} &\\\\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & & e_1  e_1 & 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 2e_2  e_2 & e_1 & 1 & & 3e_3  \\\\vdots & & \\\\ddots &\\\\ddots & \\\\vdots  e_{n - 1} & \\\\cdots & e_2 & e_1 & ne_n \\\\end{vmatrix} \\\\[7pt] ={} &\\\\begin{vmatrix} e_1 & 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots  2e_2 & e_1 & 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots  3e_3 & e_2 & e_1 & 1  \\\\vdots & & & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots  ne_n & e_{n - 1} & \\\\cdots & & e_1 \\\\end{vmatrix}. \\\\end{align} Solving for e_n instead of for p_n is similar, as the analogous computations for the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials; in each case the details are slightly messier than the final results, which are (Macdonald 1979, p. 20): :\\\\begin{align} e_n = \\\\frac1{n!}&\\\\begin{vmatrix} p_1 & 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots  p_2 & p_1 & 2 & 0 & \\\\cdots  \\\\vdots & & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots  p_{n-1} & p_{n-2} & \\\\cdots & p_1 & n-1  p_n & p_{n-1} & \\\\cdots & p_2 & p_1 \\\\end{vmatrix} \\\\[7pt] p_n = (-1)^{n-1}&\\\\begin{vmatrix} h_1 & 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots  2h_2 & h_1 & 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots  3h_3 & h_2 & h_1 & 1  \\\\vdots & & & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots  nh_n & h_{n-1} & \\\\cdots & & h_1 \\\\end{vmatrix} \\\\[7pt] h_n = \\\\frac1{n!}&\\\\begin{vmatrix} p_1 & -1 & 0 & \\\\cdots  p_2 & p_1 & -2 & 0 & \\\\cdots  \\\\vdots & & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots  p_{n - 1} & p_{n-2} & \\\\cdots & p_1 & 1 - n  p_n & p_{n-1} & \\\\cdots & p_2 & p_1 \\\\end{vmatrix}. \\\\end{align} Note that the use of determinants makes that the formula for h_n has additional minus signs compared to the one for e_n, while the situation for the expanded form given earlier is opposite. As remarked in (Littlewood 1950, p. 84) one can alternatively obtain the formula for h_n by taking the permanent of the matrix for e_n instead of the determinant, and more generally an expression for any Schur polynomial can be obtained by taking the corresponding immanant of this matrix.  Derivation of the identities  Each of Newton's identities can easily be checked by elementary algebra; however, their validity in general needs a proof. Here are some possible derivations. = From the special case n = k = One can obtain the k-th Newton identity in k variables by substitution into : \\\\prod_{i=1}^k (t - x_i) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^{k-i} e_{k-i}(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_k)t^i as follows. Substituting xj for t gives :0= \\\\sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^{k-i} e_{k-i}(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_k){x_j}^i \\\\quad\\\\text{for }1\\\\leq j\\\\leq k Summing over all j gives :0= (-1)^kke_k(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_k)+\\\\sum_{i=1}^k(-1)^{k-i} e_{k-i}(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_k)p_i(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_k), where the terms for i = 0 were taken out of the sum because p0 is (usually) not defined. This equation immediately gives the k-th Newton identity in k variables. Since this is an identity of symmetric polynomials (homogeneous) of degree k, its validity for any number of variables follows from its validity for k variables. Concretely, the identities in n < k variables can be deduced by setting k − n variables to zero. The k-th Newton identity in n > k variables contains more terms on both sides of the equation than the one in k variables, but its validity will be assured if the coefficients of any monomial match. Because no individual monomial involves more than k of the variables, the monomial will survive the substitution of zero for some set of n − k (other) variables, after which the equality of coefficients is one that arises in the k-th Newton identity in k (suitably chosen) variables. = Comparing coefficients in series = Another derivation can be obtained by computations in the ring of formal power series R, where R is Z[x1,..., xn], the ring of polynomials in n variables x1,..., xn over the integers. Starting again from the basic relation : \\\\prod_{i=1}^n (t - x_i) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k} a_k t^{n-k} and \\"reversing the polynomials\\" by substituting 1/t for t and then multiplying both sides by tn to remove negative powers of t, gives : \\\\prod_{i=1}^n (1- x_it) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k} a_k t^k. (the above computation should be performed in the field of fractions of R; alternatively, the identity can be obtained simply by evaluating the product on the left side) Swapping sides and expressing the ai as the elementary symmetric polynomials they stand for gives the identity :\\\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k} e_k(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) t^k=\\\\prod_{i=1}^n (1- x_it). One formally differentiates both sides with respect to t, and then (for convenience) multiplies by t, to obtain :\\\\begin{align} \\\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k}k e_k(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) t^k &= t \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left[(-x_i) \\\\prod olimits_{j eq i}(1 - x_jt)\\\\right] &= -\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{x_it}{1 - x_it}\\\\right) \\\\prod olimits_{j=1}^n (1 - x_jt) &= -\\\\left[\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty(x_it)^j\\\\right]\\\\left[\\\\sum_{\\\\ell=0}^n (-1)^\\\\ell e_\\\\ell(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) t^\\\\ell\\\\right] &= \\\\left[\\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty p_j(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n)t^j\\\\right] \\\\left[\\\\sum_{\\\\ell=0}^n (-1)^{\\\\ell - 1} e_\\\\ell(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) t^\\\\ell\\\\right], \\\\end{align} where the polynomial on the right hand side was first rewritten as a rational function in order to be able to factor out a product out of the summation, then the fraction in the summand was developed as a series in t, using the formula :\\\\frac{X}{1 - X} = X + X^2 + X^3 + X^4 + X^5 + \\\\cdots, and finally the coefficient of each t j was collected, giving a power sum. (The series in t is a formal power series, but may alternatively be thought of as a series expansion for t sufficiently close to 0, for those more comfortable with that; in fact one is not interested in the function here, but only in the coefficients of the series.) Comparing coefficients of tk on both sides one obtains :(-1)^{k}k e_k(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{k-j-1} p_j(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n)e_{k-j}(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n), which gives the k-th Newton identity. = As a telescopic sum of symmetric function identities = The following derivation, given essentially in (Mead, 1992), is formulated in the ring of symmetric functions for clarity (all identities are independent of the number of variables). Fix some k > 0, and define the symmetric function r(i) for 2 ≤ i ≤ k as the sum of all distinct monomials of degree k obtained by multiplying one variable raised to the power i with k − i distinct other variables (this is the monomial symmetric function mγ where γ is a hook shape (i,1,1,...,1)). In particular r(k) = pk; for r(1) the description would amount to that of ek, but this case was excluded since here monomials no longer have any distinguished variable. All products piek−i can be expressed in terms of the r(j) with the first and last case being somewhat special. One has :p_ie_{k-i}=r(i)+r(i+1)\\\\quad\\\\text{for }1 since each product of terms on the left involving distinct variables contributes to r(i), while those where the variable from pi already occurs among the variables of the term from ek−i contributes to r(i + 1), and all terms on the right are so obtained exactly once. For i = k one multiplies by e0 = 1, giving trivially :p_ke_0=p_k=r(k). Finally the product p1ek−1 for i = 1 gives contributions to r(i + 1) = r(2) like for other values i < k, but the remaining contributions produce k times each monomial of ek, since any one of the variables may come from the factor p1; thus :p_1e_{k-1}=ke_k+r(2). The k-th Newton identity is now obtained by taking the alternating sum of these equations, in which all terms of the form r(i) cancel out. = Combinatorial Proof = A short combinatorial proof of Newton's Identities is given in (Zeilberger, 1984)  See also  *Power sum symmetric polynomial *Elementary symmetric polynomial *Symmetric function *Fluid solutions, an article giving an application of Newton's identities to computing the characteristic polynomial of the Einstein tensor in the case of a perfect fluid, and similar articles on other types of exact solutions in general relativity.

The ballpark is located in downtown Chatham along Massachusetts Route 28. Nestled within a natural bowl of embankments that provides ample spectator vantage points, Veterans Field has been called a \\"panorama of beauty,\\" and \\"a portrait right out of Yankee Magazine.\\" The ballpark features a large adjacent playground, and draws from the bustling foot traffic of nearby Main Street shops. The grassy right field hillside seats fans on blankets and beach chairs, and is topped by the quaint backdrop of the town's fire house and the former rail station that is now the Chatham Railroad Museum. Surrounded on three sides by the sea, the town's geographic location frequently produces \\"fog delays\\" during evening ball games, an oddity that has come to be seen as symbolic of the unique flavor of baseball in Chatham. A charter member of the original four-team Cape Cod Baseball League that began play in 1923, Chatham quickly got to work constructing a field that would host its town baseball team and other town events. In 1925, the plot of land for Veterans Field was acquired, and its name was settled upon \\"as a memorial to those from Chatham who served in the World War and all other wars.\\" By the early spring of 1927, final grading of the field was being completed, and that season both the Chatham High School baseball team as well as the Chatham CCBL franchise began play at the park. Various improvements to Veterans Field have taken place since its original construction. A 2008 grant from the Yawkey Foundation provided the impetus for significant upgrades to the lighting and outfield playing surface, as well as the installation of a brick backstop and protective netting. In 1984, Veterans Field hosted a contest between the CCBL all-stars and the United States national baseball team, which was touring in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Veterans Field again hosted a CCBL-Team USA matchup in 2000, as the national team prepared for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. The 2000 event drew a reported 10,000 fans, the largest crowd to date ever to witness a sporting event on Cape Cod. The 2001 Hollywood romantic comedy Summer Catch was set in Chatham, and used Veterans Field in its portrayal of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Veterans Field hosted the CCBL's annual all-star game festivities in 1964, 1968, 1971, 1998, 2008, and 2016, and has seen Chatham claim CCBL championships in 1967, 1982, 1992, 1996, and 1998.

Military accidents are listed at List of military nuclear accidents. Civil radiation accidents not involving fissile material are listed at List of civilian radiation accidents. For a general discussion of both civilian and military accidents, see Nuclear and radiation accidents. Scope of this article In listing civilian nuclear accidents, the following criteria have been followed: # Notably severe: there must be well-attested and substantial health damage, property damage or contamination; if an International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) level is available, of at least two. # Nuclear aspect: the damage must be related directly to nuclear operations or materials; the event should involve fissile material or a reactor, not merely (for example) having occurred at the site of a nuclear power plant. # Primarily civilian: the nuclear operation/material must be principally for non-military purposes. 1950s * — INES Level 5 – Chalk River, Ontario, Canada – Reactor core damaged : A reactor shutoff rod failure, combined with several operator errors, led to a major power excursion of more than double the reactor's rated output at AECL's NRX reactor. The operators purged the reactor's heavy water moderator, and the reaction stopped in under 30 seconds. A subsequent cover gas system failure led to hydrogen explosions, which severely damaged the reactor core. The fission products from approximately of uranium were released through the reactor stack. Contaminated light water coolant leaked from the damaged coolant circuit into the reactor building; some were pumped via pipeline to a disposal area to avoid contamination of the Ottawa River. Subsequent monitoring of surrounding water sources revealed no contamination. After the incident, approximately 1202 people were involved in the two-year-long cleanup.\\"The NRX Incident\\" by Peter Jedicke No immediate fatalities or injuries resulted from the incident; a 1982 follow-up study of exposed workers showed no long-term health effects, though Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) dosimetry files were lost in a 1956 fire. Future U.S. President Jimmy Carter, a nuclear engineer and then a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy, was among the cleanup crew. * 29 Sept 1957 — INES Level 6 — Mayak plutonium-production plant — Nuclear waste tank explosion — Main Article: Kyshtym disaster * 10 Oct 1957 — INES Level 5 — Windscale, plutonium production reactor :In the Windscale fire, the reactor core caught fire leading to radioactive materials released across UK and Europe. * — INES Level needed – Chalk River, Ontario, Canada – Fuel damaged : Due to inadequate cooling, a damaged uranium fuel rod caught fire and was torn in two as it was being removed from the core at the NRU reactor. The fire was extinguished, but not before radioactive combustion products contaminated the interior of the reactor building and, to a lesser degree, an area surrounding the laboratory site. Approximately 679 people were employed in the clean-up.\\"Reactor Accidents at Chalk River:The Human Fallout\\" by Dr. Gordon Edwards\\"What are the details of the accident at Chalk River's NRU reactor in 1958?\\" by Dr. Jeremy Whitlock A corporal named Bjarnie Hannibal Paulson who was at the cleanup did not die from his exposure, but developed unusual skin cancers. Paulson had to testify at many hearings before he was awarded compensation for his radiation injuries.\\"The Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility\\" letter by Dr. Gordon Edwards * — INES Level needed – Vinča, Serbia (then Yugoslavia) – Criticality excursion, irradiation of personnel : During a subcritical counting experiment, a power buildup went undetected at the Vinca Nuclear Institute's zero-power natural uranium heavy water-moderated research reactor. Saturation of radiation detection chambers gave the researchers false readings and the level of moderator in the reactor tank was raised, triggering a power excursion which a researcher detected from the smell of ozone. Six scientists received radiation doses of (p. 96). An experimental bone marrow transplant treatment was performed on all of them in France and five survived, despite the ultimate rejection of the marrow in all cases. A single woman among them later had a child without apparent complications. This was one of the first nuclear incidents investigated by then-newly formed IAEA. * — INES Level needed – Santa Susana Field Laboratory, California, United States – Partial meltdown : A partial core meltdown took place when the Sodium Reactor Experiment (SRE) experienced a power excursion that caused severe overheating of the reactor core, resulting in the melting of one-third of the nuclear fuel and significant release of radioactive gases. The amount of radioactivity released is disputed, with it ranging from 28 Curies to as much as 240 to 260 times worse than Three Mile Island. Over the succeeding years, the site was cleaned up and all buildings and contamination removed. The soil was removed and other soil brought in and now forms a portion of an area near the Simi Valley Adventist Hospital. 1960s * — INES Level needed – Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States – Core melt accident : A core meltdown occurred at the Westinghouse Waltz Mill test reactor. From what information remains of the event, one fuel element melted, resulting in the disposition of 2 million gallons of contaminated water generated during the accident. At least a portion of the water was retained on site in lagoons, a condition which eventually led to detectable 90Sr in groundwater plus contaminated soil. The site is currently undergoing cleanup. * — INES Level needed – Wood River Junction, Richmond, Rhode Island, United States – Criticality accident : A worker at a United Nuclear Corporation fuel facility led to an accidental criticality. Robert Peabody, believing he was using a diluted uranium solution, accidentally put concentrated solution into an agitation tank containing sodium carbonate. Peabody was exposed to of radiation and died two days later. Ninety minutes after the criticality, a plant manager and another administrator returned to the building and were exposed to , but suffered no ill effects.http://www.bazley.net/institute/archives/UNCdeath.htmlMcLaughlin et al. pages 33-34 * — INES Level 4 – Monroe, Michigan, United States – Partial meltdown : A sodium cooling system malfunction caused the meltdown of some fuel elements at the Fermi 1 fast breeder reactor. The accident was attributed to a zirconium fragment that obstructed a flow-guide in the sodium cooling system. Two of the 105 fuel assemblies melted during the accident, but no contamination was recorded outside the containment vessel. * Winter 1966-1967 (date unknown) — INES Level needed - location unknown - Loss of coolant accident : The Soviet Navy icebreaker Lenin, the USSR’s first nuclear- powered surface ship, suffered a major accident (possibly a nuclear meltdown — exactly what happened remains a matter of controversy in the West) in one of its three reactors. To find the leak the crew broke through the concrete and steel radiation shield with sledgehammers, causing irreparable damage. It was rumored that around 30 of the crew were killed. The ship was abandoned for a year to allow radiation levels to drop before the three reactors were removed, to be dumped into the Tsivolko Fjord on the Kara Sea, along with 60% of the fuel elements packed in a separate container. The reactors were replaced with two new ones, and the ship reentered service in 1970, serving until 1989. * — INES Level needed – Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, United Kingdom – Partial meltdown : Graphite debris partially blocked a fuel channel causing a fuel element to melt and catch fire at the Chapelcross nuclear power station. Contamination was confined to the reactor core. The core was repaired and restarted in 1969, operating until the plant's shutdown in 2004. * — INES Level 4 – Lucens, Canton of Vaud, Switzerland – Explosion : A loss of coolant led to meltdown of one fuel element and a steam explosion in the Lucens reactor, an experimental reactor in a large rock cavern at Lucens. The underground location of this reactor acted like a containment building and prevented any outside contamination. The cavern was contaminated and temporary sealed. No injuries or fatalities resulted. : Defueling and partial dismantling occurred from 1969 to 1973. In 1988, the lowest caverns were filled with concrete, and a regulatory permit was issued in December 1990. Currently, the archives of the Canton of Vaud are located in the caverns.\\"Interface between Operator, Regulatory Body and Public\\" at IAEA.org 1970s * — INES Level 3 – Greifswald, Germany (then East Germany) – Station blackout : A fire in a cable duct after a short circuit disabled the electrical power supply for all feedwater and emergency core cooling pumps. A power supply was improvised by the operating personnel after several hours. * — INES Level 4 – Jaslovské Bohunice, Slovakia (then Czechoslovakia) – Fuel damaged : Operators neglected to remove moisture-absorbing materials from a fuel rod assembly before loading it into the KS 150 reactor at power plant A-1. The accident resulted in damaged fuel integrity, extensive corrosion damage of fuel cladding and release of radioactivity into the plant area. The affected reactor was decommissioned following this accident. * — INES Level 5 – Middletown, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, United States – Partial meltdown : Equipment failures, poor user interface design, and worker mistakes contributed to a loss of coolant and a partial core meltdown at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station southeast of Harrisburg. While the reactor was extensively damaged, on-site radiation exposure was under 100 millirems (less than annual exposure due to natural sources). Area residents received a smaller exposure of , or about 1/3 the dose from eating a banana per day for one year. There were no fatalities. Follow-up radiological studies predict between zero and one long-term cancer fatality. 1980s * — INES Level 4 – Saint-Laurent-des-Eaux, France – Nuclear materials leak : A brief power excursion in Reactor A2 led to a rupture of fuel bundles and a minor release of nuclear materials at the Saint-Laurent Nuclear Power Plant. The reactor was repaired and continued operation until its decommissioning in 1992. * — INES Level 2 – Tsuruga, Japan – Radioactive materials released into Sea of Japan; overexposure of workers : More than 100 workers were exposed to doses of up to per day radiation during repairs of the Tsuruga Nuclear Power Plant, violating the Japan Atomic Power Company's limit of per day. * — INES Level 4 – Buenos Aires, Argentina – Accidental criticality : An operator error during a fuel plate reconfiguration in an experimental test reactor led to an excursion of 3×1017 fissions at the RA-2 facility. The operator absorbed 20 Gy of gamma and 17 Gy of neutron radiation which killed him two days later. Another 17 people outside of the reactor room absorbed doses ranging from 350 mGy to less than 10 mGy. pg103 * — INES Level 7 – Pripyat, Ukraine (then Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) – Power excursion, explosion, complete meltdown : An inadequate reactor safety system test(memoires of vice chief engineer of operation Anatoly Dyatlov, in Russian) led to an uncontrolled power excursion, causing a severe steam explosion, meltdown, and release of radioactive materials at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant located approximately 100 kilometers (60 miles) north-northwest of Kiev. Approximately 50 fatalities (mostly cleanup personnel) resulted from the accident and the immediate aftermath. An additional nine fatal cases of thyroid cancer in children in the Chernobyl area have been attributed to the accident. The explosion and combustion of the graphite reactor core spread radioactive material over much of Europe. 100,000 people were evacuated from the areas immediately surrounding Chernobyl; in addition, 300,000 were touched from heavy fallout in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. An \\"Exclusion Zone\\" was created surrounding the site encompassing approximately and deemed off-limits for human habitation for an indefinite period. Several studies by governments, U.N. agencies and environmental groups have estimated the consequences and eventual number of casualties. Their findings are subject to controversy. * — no INES Level – Hamm-Uentrop, Germany (then West Germany) – Fuel damaged : Spherical fuel pebbles became lodged in the pipe used to deliver fuel elements to the reactor at an experimental 300-megawatt THTR-300 HTGR. Attempts by an operator to dislodge the fuel pebble damaged the pipe, releasing activated coolant gas which was detectable up to two kilometers from the reactor.[Begründung zur atomrechtlichen Anordnung vom 3.

The vessel contained a mixture of concentrated nitric acid, uranium, plutonium along with a mixture of radioactive and organic waste from a prior extraction cycle. The explosion dislodged the concrete lid of the bunker and blew a large hole in the roof of the building, releasing approximately of Pu 239 and of other radionuclides into the environment. The contamination plume extended NE of building 201, beyond the facility property. The small village of Georgievka (pop. 200) was at the end of the fallout plume, but no fatalities, illnesses or injuries were reported. The accident exposed 160 on-site workers and almost two thousand cleanup workers to total doses of up to 50 mSv (the threshold limit for radiation workers is 20 mSv/yr).Timeline: Nuclear plant accidents * — INES Level 2http://www.climatesceptics.org/event/841 – Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan – Control rod malfunction : Operators attempting to insert one control rod during an inspection neglected procedure and instead withdrew three causing a 15 minute uncontrolled sustained reaction at the number 1 reactor of Shika Nuclear Power Plant. The Hokuriku Electric Power Company who owned the reactor did not report this incident and falsified records, covering it up until March, 2007.Japanese utility to shut reactor after admitting accident cover-up * — INES Level 4 – Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan – Accidental criticality : Inadequately trained part-time workers prepared a uranyl nitrate solution containing about of uranium, which exceeded the critical mass, into a precipitation tank at a uranium reprocessing facility in Tokai-mura northeast of Tokyo, Japan. The tank was not designed to dissolve this type of solution and was not configured to prevent eventual criticality. Three workers were exposed to (neutron) radiation doses in excess of allowable limits. Two of these workers died. 116 other workers received lesser doses of 1 mSv or greater though not in excess of the allowable limit.Tokaimura Criticality AccidentTokaimura Criticality Accident Nuclear Issues Briefing Paper #52Chronology and Press Reports of the Tokaimura CriticalityTimeline: Nuclear plant accidents 2000s * — INES Level 3 – Paks, Hungary – Fuel damaged : Partially spent fuel rods undergoing cleaning in a tank of heavy water ruptured and spilled fuel pellets at Paks Nuclear Power Plant. It is suspected that inadequate cooling of the rods during the cleaning process combined with a sudden influx of cold water thermally shocked fuel rods causing them to split. Boric acid was added to the tank to prevent the loose fuel pellets from achieving criticality. Ammonia and hydrazine were also added to absorb 131I.Incremented radioactivity of the heat carrier during refueling outage at a time of fuel cleaning  Nuclear power in Europe * — INES Level 3 – Sellafield, England, United Kingdom – Nuclear material leak : of uranium and of plutonium dissolved in of nitric acid leaked over several months from a cracked pipe into a stainless steel sump chamber at the Thorp nuclear fuel reprocessing plant.

The previous INES rating had been 5, a final rating is expected after the situation has been completely resolved) : After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami of March 11, the emergency power supply of the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant failed. This was followed by deliberate releases of radioactive gas from reactors 1 and 2 to relieve pressure. : March 12: triggered by falling water levels and exposed fuel rods, a hydrogen explosion occurred at reactor 1, resulting in the collapse of the concrete outer structure.Fox News Channel Breaking News Alert (live TV coverage), 3:00 am EST, March 12Live blog, BBC News, March 12, 2011 Although the reactor containment itself was confirmed to be intact,Explosion at Fukushima I reactor 1; 4 injured, 3 irradiated (Japanese) the hourly radiation from the plant reached - an amount equivalent to that allowable for ordinary people in one year.See also: : Residents of the Fukushima area were advised to stay inside, close doors and windows, turn off air conditioning, and to cover their mouths with masks, towels or handkerchiefs as well as not to drink tap water. By the evening of March 12, the exclusion zone had been extended to around the plant and 70,000 to 80,000 people had been evacuated from homes in northern Japan.NHK News 7 (TV coverage), March 13, 2011, 10:46 UTC : March 14: a second, hydrogen explosion (nearly identical to the first explosion in Unit 1) occurred in the reactor building for Unit 3, with similar effects. : March 15: a third explosion occurred in the “pressure suppression room” of Unit 2 and is initially said not to have breached the reactor’s inner steel containment vessel, but later reports indicated that the explosion damaged the steel containment structure of Unit 2 and much larger releases of radiation were expected than previously. That same day, a fourth explosion damaged the 4th floor area above the reactor and spent fuel pool of the Unit 4 reactor. Contrary to the TEPCO press release, aerial photos show that most of the outer building was actually destroyed. The fuel rods (both new and spent fuel) of reactor Unit 4, stored in the now exposed spent fuel pool, were reportedly exposed to air – this would have risked the melting of the nuclear fuel. However, later research found the fuel rods had been covered by water all the time.http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/nu/fukushima-np/images/handouts_120516_07-e.pdf : TEPCO estimated that 70% of the fuel in Unit 1 had melted, and 33% in Unit 2, further suspecting that Unit 3's core might also be damaged.Fukushima Timeline scientificamerican.com In November 2011 TEPCO released the report of the Modular Accident Analysis Program (MAAP).The Evaluation Status of Reactor Core Damage at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station Units 1 to 3 November 30, 2011 Tokyo Electric Power Company The report showed that the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) in Unit 1 (commonly known as the reactor core) had been damaged during the disaster, and that significant amounts of fuel had fallen into the bottom of the primary containment vessel (PCV) – the erosion of the concrete of the PCV by the molten fuel immediately after the disaster was estimated to have been stopped in approx. depth, with the thickness of the containment being . Gas sampling done before the report detected no signs of an ongoing reaction of the fuel with the concrete of the PCV and all the fuel in Unit 1 was estimated to be \\"well cooled down, including the fuel dropped on the bottom of the reactor\\". MAAP further showed that fuel in Unit 2 and Unit 3 had melted, however less than Unit 1, and fuel was presumed to be still in the RPV, with no significant amounts of fuel fallen to the bottom of the PCV. The report further suggested that \\"there is a range in the evaluation results\\" from \\"most fuel in the RPV (some fuel in PCV)\\" in Unit 2 and Unit 3, to \\"all fuel in the RPV (none fuel fallen to the PCV)\\". For Unit 2 and Unit 3 it was estimated that the \\"fuel is cooled sufficiently\\". The larger damage in Unit 1 was according to the report due to long time that cooling water was not injected in Unit 1, letting much more decay heat accumulate – for about 1 day there was no water injection for Unit 1, while Unit 2 and Unit 3 had only a quarter of a day without water injection. As of December 2013, it was reported that TEPCO estimated for Unit 1 that \\"the decay heat must have decreased enough, the molten fuel can be assumed to remain in PCV (Primary container vessel)\\".Most of fuel NOT remaining in reactor1 core / Tepco “but molten fuel is stopped in the concrete base” Fukushima-Diary.com * 8 August 2019 - no INES level - Nyonoksa, Russia - occurred on 8 August 2019 near Nyonoksa, a village under the administrative jurisdiction of Severodvinsk, Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russian Federation.

It is located on the Neckar river, between Offenburg to the west (about away) and Tübingen to the east (about away). It has around 25,000 inhabitants, of whom about 6,000 live in the main town of Horb, and the remainder in 18 associated villages and districts which form part of the same municipality. If the entire municipality is counted, it is the largest town in the District of Freudenstadt. Since 1 January 1981 Horb am Neckar has had the status of a Große Kreisstadt, serving as a mid-sized center within the Northern Black Forest Region of the Karlsruhe Administrative Region. It also belongs to the \\"Cooperative Zone\\" of the Stuttgart Metropolitan Region. Horb am Neckar operates a combined administration with the neighbouring communities of Empfingen and Eutingen im Gäu. Geography Horb lies on the eastern margin of the northern part of the Black Forest at the Neckar. The well- preserved old town, with an ancient castle and castle gardens and a typical market place where the town hall is still located, lies on a ridge overlooking the Neckar. The modern town and its outskirts stretch up the valleys of both rivers. =Constituent communities= In addition to the main town of Horb, the municipality includes a number of communities which are recognised within the terms of the 1970s Baden-Württemberg local government reform, that is they have an elected council and council chairman. These are Ahldorf, Altheim, Betra, Bildechingen, Bittelbronn, Dettensee, Dettingen, Dettlingen, Dießen, Grünmettstetten, Ihlingen, Isenburg, Mühlen, Mühringen, Nordstetten, Rexingen and Talheim, the last of which is made up of the formerly independent communities of Obertalheim and Untertalheim. These are referred to formally (for example, in postal purposes) as Horb-Ahldorf, Horb-Altheim, etc. There are also other districts with distinct names, such as Hohenberg and Haugenstein, but no formally recognised boundaries, and numerous isolated hamlets with handfuls of inhabitants, such as Fronholzhof, Frundeckhof, Heidgrundhof, Hohenfichtehof, Markstallhof, Auchtert-Höfe, Breitenbaum-Höfe, Josefshof, Käppleshof, Kegelhof, Isenburger Höfe, Buchhöfe, Kreuzhöfe, Plattenhöfe, Ziegelhof, Heidehöfe, Kapellenhöfe, and Röteberg, not to mention even smaller settlements such as Neckarhausen or Priorberg. =Neighbouring municipalities= The following towns and communities border on Horb am Neckar, listing them in clockwise order starting in the east: Eutingen im Gäu (Landkreis Freudenstadt), Starzach (in Landkreis Tübingen), Haigerloch (Zollernalbkreis), Empfingen (Landkreis Freudenstadt), Sulz am Neckar (Landkreis Rottweil), Glatten, Schopfloch and Waldachtal (all in Landkreis Freudenstadt), and finally Haiterbach and Nagold, both in Landkreis Calw). History Horb was first documented as or , meaning \\"swamp\\" in Old High German, in 1090. But since Old High German was nearly extinct at that time, it is assumed that Horb is even older than that. The swampy land along the Neckar forced the builders of the town to lay it out among the foothills of the mountain called Schütteberg. Today the townscape is characterised by the location of the whole historic city on top of a hill, making it visible from any direction. Horb was first documented as a town in 1228, and the first references to a mayor (Schultheiß) and a market are to be found in 1244 and 1277, respectively. Until 1305, Horb belonged to the counts palatine of Tübingen, and later to the counts of Hohenberg. In 1381, Horb came into the possession of Austria (Further Austria) and served as an administrative seat for the local Vogt. Later, in 1806, Horb became part of the Kingdom of Württemberg, and a year it was made into an administrative center, Oberamt Horb. Its borders had changed several times in the following years, and in 1938 it was reorganized as a rural district, Landkreis Horb. Current constituent communities Betra, Dettensee, Dettingen, Dettlingen and Dießen had belonged to the Principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen since 1803, where they were organized under Oberamt Hechingen (and from 1838–1854, Oberamt Haigerloch). In 1925, Oberamt Hechingen was made into Landkreis Hechingen. Between 1971 and 1975, a total of 18 surrounding municipalities, including the above-mentioned communities from the District of Hechingen, were assigned to Landkreis Horb or its legal successor, Landkreis Freudenstadt. The districts of both Horb and Hechingen were dissolved as part of Baden-Württemberg's 1973 local government reforms, and the majority of Horb's territory, including the city itself, was transferred to Freudenstadt, itself now part of the newly created Northern Black Forest Region in the recently expanded Regierungsbezirk of Karlsruhe. This is how a town that once belonged to Württemberg came to be administered from the former capital of Baden. In 1979, Horb exceeded 20,000 residents for the first time, thus allowing the town to petition the state government of Baden-Württemberg to be made into a major district town (Große Kreisstadt); the request was granted, effective as of 1 January 1981. =Religion= Collegiate church and landmark of Horb am Neckar (2018) In the Middle Ages, Horb am Neckar was part of the Diocese of Constance, under the local supervision of the Archdiaconate \\"Vor dem Walde\\", based in Dornstetten. When the Protestant Reformation came to Germany, Horb was still a part of Further Austria, and thus remained overwhelmingly Catholic along with the rest of Austria. Upon its transfer to the Kingdom of Württemberg, the territory was assigned to the Diocese of Rottenburg (today, Rottenburg-Stuttgart) and made the seat of a deanery. In 1976 it was merged with the Deanery of Freudenstadt to form a new deanery, still named for Freudenstadt but based in Horb; it contains nearly all of the Catholic parishes in the mostly Protestant Landkreis Freudenstadt. Today there are two pastoral units (German Seelsorgeeinheiten) operating in the territory of Horb am Neckar: Seelsorgeeinheit Steinachtal includes the parishes in Altheim, Grünmettstetten, Bittelbronn, Untertalheim and Obertalheim; Seelsorgeeinheit Horb includes parishes in Horb itself, Ihlingen and Isenburg, Bildechingen, Mühlen, Rexingen and Nordstetten, Ahldorf and Mühringen, along with Wiesenstetten, which belongs to the municipality of Empfingen. Parishes in Betra, Dettensee, Dettingen, Dettlingen and Dießen have actually belonged to the Archdiocese of Freiburg (Deanery of Zollern) since 1827, due to those communities' former inclusion in the Principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. In the 19th century, Protestants (Lutheran) also settled in Horb. In 1866, they were able to establish their first congregation there, and some time later build their own place of worship, the Johanneskirche (St. John's). The community based in Horb is part of the Sulz am Neckar district within the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg, and includes members of the Protestant churches in Horb itself, in Altheim, Isenburg, Grünmettstetten, Nordstetten and Bildechingen, as well as in the neighboring municipality of Eutingen im Gäu. Another Protestant community based in Dettingen includes Protestants in Betra, Dießen, Ihlingen, and Rexingen along with neighboring Fischingen and Glatt; yet another one based in Mühlen includes those in Ahldorf, Dettensee, and Mühringen. Protestants in Talheim (formerly Obertalheim and Unterteilheim) belong to the Heiterback-Talheim community in the Nagold district, and those in Bittelbronn and Dettlingen belong to the Shopfloch community in the Freudenstadt district. Aside from Germany's two major Christian denominations, there are also communities considered \\"free churches\\", including a Pentecostal congregation associated with Germany's Federation of Pentecostal Churches (Bund Freikirchlicher Pfingstgemeinden, BFD), the German branch of the Assemblies of God. There is also congregation of the New Apostolic Church in Horb, belonging to church's Tübingen apostolic region. Horb and its constituent communities were once home to several Jewish communities, but during the Nazi era these communities suffered from forced mass emigration and deportation. Jewish communities could be found in Rexingen, Nordstetten and neighboring Baisingen, among others. Until 1911, Horb's Jewish communities were part of the Mühringen rabbinical district. =Coat of arms= The coat of arms of Horb am Neckar consists of a shield divided horizontally, the top half silver and the bottom half red. In the 13th century, the counts palatine of Tübingen established Horb as a town, incorporating the existing settlement along the Neckar. The oldest surviving town seal dates from 1261 and depicts the arms and banner of the counts palatine; an additional town seal from 1301 also depicts the arms of the Tübingen family. In 1305 Horb was acquired via marriage by the counts of Hohenberg, and ever since the town has borne the Hohenberg arms. The oldest town seal bearing these arms comes from 1308. Economy and infrastructure Tourism plays a major role in the economy of Horb am Neckar, with numerous local projects and organizations in place to promote the town's various cultural events and attractions, which typically include concerts, Kabaretts, and theatrical performances. The annual Renaissance fair \\"Maximilian- Ritterspiele\\" (\\"Maximilian jousting\\"), taking place in the middle of June draws crowds from all over the region, and Horb's \\"Mini Rock Festival\\" hosts several thousand attendees each year and features musical acts from all over the world. Since 2005, the festival has been primarily organised and staffed by teenage volunteers. The largest employer in town is the engineering firm Bosch Rexroth, which operates a plant in Horb. Other businesses with a presence in the town include the manufacturers Fischer and LEUCO. Most of Horb's industrial facilities are located in the constituent communities of Heiligenfeld or Hohenberg. Local daily newspapers include the \\"Neckar-Chronik\\" edition of Südwest Presse, based in Ulm, and a Horb edition of the Schwarzwälder Bote, based in Oberndorf am Neckar. =Government= The local governing body is a town council (Gemeinderat) consisting of 32 members, with elections held every five years. Since the most recent elections in 2014, CDU holds 12 seats on the council, FDP holds 9, and SDP 5, with the remaining seats split Greens, Republicans, and independents. The mayor (since 1981, Oberbürgermeister) is directly elected every eight years. The current officeholder, Peter Rosenberger (CDU) was elected in 2009 with 98.45% of the vote (no opponent). List of mayors: * 1947–1949: Franz Mauz * 1950–1955: Karl Gramlich * 1955–1987: Karl Haegele (CDU) * 1987–1995: Hans Hörner (CDU) * 1995–2009: Michael Theurer (FDP) * seit 2009: Peter Rosenberger (CDU) Horb is also seat of the local court (Amtsgericht), which is positioned under the Rottweil regional court (Landgericht), itself under the umbrella of Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart, one of two supraregional courts in Baden- Württemberg (See Judiciary of Germany). The town also has a notary's office, as well as a satellite office of the Freudenstadt regional court. The customs office (Zollamt) in Horb is subordinate office to the main customs office in Karlsruhe.

Virtually all chromium ore is processed via hexavalent chromium, specifically the salt sodium dichromate. Approximately of hexavalent chromium were produced in 1985.Gerd Anger, Jost Halstenberg, Klaus Hochgeschwender, Christoph Scherhag, Ulrich Korallus, Herbert Knopf, Peter Schmidt, Manfred Ohlinger, \\"Chromium Compounds\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley- VCH, Weinheim, 2005. Additional hexavalent chromium compounds are chromium trioxide and various salts of chromate and dichromate, among others. Hexavalent chromium is used in textile dyes, wood preservation, anti-corrosion products, chromate conversion coatings, and a variety of niche uses. Industrial uses of hexavalent chromium compounds include chromate pigments in dyes, paints, inks, and plastics; chromates added as anticorrosive agents to paints, primers, and other surface coatings; and chromic acid electroplated onto metal parts to provide a decorative or protective coating. Hexavalent chromium can be formed when performing \\"hot work\\" such as welding on stainless steel or melting chromium metal. In these situations the chromium is not originally hexavalent, but the high temperatures involved in the process result in oxidation that converts the chromium to a hexavalent state.29 CFR OSHA General Industry 1910 Hexavalent chromium can also be found in drinking water and public water systems. All hexavalent chromium compounds are toxic (due to their oxidizing power) as well as carcinogenic (IARC Group 1), especially if airborne and inhaled where they cause lung cancer. Also positive associations have been observed between exposure to chromium (VI) compounds and cancer of the nose and nasal sinuses. Workers in many occupations are exposed to hexavalent chromium. Problematic exposure is known to occur among workers who handle chromate-containing products and those who grind and/ or weld stainless steel. Workers who are exposed to hexavalent chromium are at increased risk of developing lung cancer, asthma, or damage to the nasal epithelia and skin. Within the European Union, the use of hexavalent chromium in electronic equipment is largely prohibited by the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive.  Toxicity  Hexavalent chromium compounds are genotoxic carcinogens. Due to its structural similarity to sulfate, chromate (a typical form of chromium(VI) at neutral pH) is transported into cells via sulfate channels. Inside the cell, hexavalent chromium(VI) is reduced first to pentavalent chromium(V) then to trivalent chromium(III) without the aid of any enzymes. The reduction occurs via direct electron transfer primarily from ascorbate and some nonprotein thiols. Vitamin C and other reducing agents combine with chromate to give chromium(III) products inside the cell. The resultant chromium(III) forms stable complexes with nucleic acids and proteins. This causes strand breaks and Cr–DNA adducts which are responsible for mutagenic damage. According to Shi et al., the DNA can also be damaged by hydroxyl radicals produced during reoxidation of pentavalent chromium by hydrogen peroxide molecules present in the cell, which can cause double-strand breakage. Both insoluble salts of lead and barium chromates as well as soluble chromates were negative in the implantation model of lung carcinogenesis. Yet, soluble chromates are a confirmed carcinogen so it would be prudent to consider all chromates carcinogenic. Chronic inhalation from occupational exposures increases the risk of respiratory cancers. The most common form of lung malignancies in chromate workers is squamous cell carcinoma. Ingestion of chromium(VI) through drinking water has been found to cause cancer in the oral cavity and small intestine. It can also cause irritation or ulcers in the stomach and intestines, and toxicity in the liver. Liver toxicity shows the body's apparent inability to detoxify chromium(VI) in the GI tract where it can then enter the circulatory system. Of 2,345 unsafe products in 2015 listed by the EU Commission for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality some 64% came from China, and 23% were clothing articles, including leather goods (and shoes) contaminated with hexavalent chromium. Chromate-dyed textiles or chromate-tanned leather shoes can cause skin sensitivity. In the U.S., the OSHA PEL for airborne exposures to hexavalent chromium is 5 µg/m3 (0.005 mg/m3). The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health proposed a REL of 0.2 µg/m3 for airborne exposures to hexavalent chromium. Hexavalent chromium is present in drinking water and public water systems. Based on the findings of the National Toxicology Program (NTP)—which is headquartered in the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)—in 2014, California established a state-wide drinking water standard of 10 parts per billion (ppb)—micrograms per liter (MCL) of 10 ppb—\\"specifically for hexavalent chromium, not total chromium.\\" For drinking water the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not have a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for hexavalent chromium.  Remediation of hexavalent chromium in groundwater and drinking water  There are mainly three types of methods to remediate hexavalent chromium in ground water and drinking water: 1) reduction of toxicity, 2) removal technologies and 3) containment technologies. Reduction of toxicity of hexavalent chromium involves methods using chemicals, microbes and plants. Some removal technologies include transporting contaminated soil offsite to a landfill, using ion exchange resins to reduce chromium(VI) concentrations to less than detectable limit and granular activated carbon (GAC) filter. Containment technologies can be employed with the use of physical barriers such as grouts, slurries or sheet piling. Attempts have been made to test the removal or reduction of hexavalent chromium from aqueous solutions and environment. For example, a research study conducted by the School of Industrial Technology, University Sains Malaysia in 2010 found that chitosan coated with poly 3-methyl thiophene can be effectively employed for removal of hexavalent chromium ions from aqueous solutions. Chitosan is a very cheap, economical, and environmentally friendly substrate for coating of this polymer. Adsorption of chromium(VI) is found to be effective in the lower pH range and at higher temperatures and subsequent desorption is readily achieved upon alkaline treatment of the adsorbent. Another study done by the American Industrial Hygiene Association indicates that the airborne hexavalent chromium in acidic mists of an electroplating tank collected on PVC filters was reduced over time after mist generation. A number of other emerging technologies for removing chromium from water are also currently under research, including the use of cationic metal-organic frameworks to selectively adsorb chromium oxyanions. Thermus scotoductus, an extremophile living in hot water as well as inhabiting domestic water heaters (per study), are capable of reducing Cr(VI). Experiments with activated sludge have also shown its ability to reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III).  Exposure and safety issues  Hexavalent chromium is a constituent of tobacco smoke. = Australia = Kooragang Island, New South Wales  Hexavalent chromium was released from the Newcastle Orica Kooragang Island ammonium nitrate plant on August 8, 2011. The incident occurred when the plant entered the ‘start up’ phase after the completion of a five-yearly maintenance overhaul. The “High Temperature Shift catalyst began the process of ‘reduction’” where steam passes through the catalyst bed and out the SP8 vent stack. At this time lower temperatures in parts of the plant caused some of the steam to condense lower which caused chromium(VI) from the catalyst bed to dissolve into the liquid present. The amount of condensate overwhelmed the drainage arrangements resulting in the emission of condensate through the SP8 vent stack. The leak went undetected for 30-minutes releasing 200 kg of chromium(VI) into the atmosphere exposing up to 20 workers at the plant and 70 nearby homes in Stockton. The town was not notified of the exposure until three days later on Wednesday morning. This accident sparked a major public controversy, with Orica criticized for playing down the extent and possible risks of the leak. The office of Environment and Heritage in Stockton collected 71 samples. Low levels of chromium were detected in 11 of them. These 11 samples were taken within six residential blocks close to the Orica plant, two of which were from water samples collected immediately south of the six block area. The Select Committee on the Kooragnang Island Orica Chemical Leak released their report on the incident in February 2012. They found Orica's approach to addressing the leak's impact was grossly inadequate. Orica failed to realize the potential impact that prevailing winds would have on an emission 60 meters high. Orica failed to inspect the area immediately downwind and notify the Office of Environment and Heritage until August 9, 2011. In Orica's initial report to the Office of Environment and Heritage they failed to disclose that the emissions had escaped off-site. In the initial report to WorkCover Orica did not disclose potential impacts on workers as well as that the substance emitted was chromium(VI). Orica's Emergency Response plan was not well understood by employees particularly about notification procedures. The original notification of residents in Stockton was only to households immediately downwind of the emission which failed to realize the potential for contamination of the surrounding area as well. The information presented at the original notification downplayed potential health risks and subsequently provided incomplete information and has led to a lack of trust between Stockton residents and Orica officials. In 2014, Orica plead guilty to nine charges before the Land and Environment court and was fined $768,000. NSW Health findings ruled that it is very unlikely that anyone in Stockton will develop cancer as a result of the incident. = Bangladesh = Toxic poultry feed contaminated by chromium-based leather tanning (as opposed to traditional slower vegetable tanning) is entering the food supply in Bangladesh through chicken meat, which is the most common source of protein in the country. Tanneries in Hazaribagh Thana, an industrial neighborhood of Dhaka, emit around 21,600 cubic meters of toxic waste each day. The tanneries also generate as much as 100 tonnes per day of scraps, trimmed raw hide, flesh and fat, which are processed into feed by neighborhood recycling plants and used in chicken and fish farms across the country. Chromium levels ranging from 350 to 4,520 micrograms (0.35 to 4.52 mg) per kilogram were found in different organs of chickens which had been fed the tannery-scraps feed for two months, according to Abul Hossain, a chemistry professor at the University of Dhaka. The study estimated up to 25% of the chickens in Bangladesh contained harmful levels of chromium(VI). = Greece = Eastern Central Greece  The chemistry of the groundwater in eastern Central Greece (central Euboea and the Asopos valley) revealed high concentrations of hexavalent chromium in groundwater systems sometimes exceeding the Greek and the EU drinking water maximum acceptable level for total chromium. Hexavalent chromium pollution here is associated with industrial waste. By using the GFAAS for total chromium, diphenylcarbazide-Cr(VI) complex colorimetric method for hexavalent chromium, and flame-AAS and ICP-MS for other toxic elements, their concentrations were investigated in several groundwater samples. The contamination of water by hexavalent chromium in central Euboea is mainly linked to natural processes, but there are anthropogenic cases.  Thebes – Tanagra – Malakasa (Asopos) Basin  In the Thebes – Tanagra – Malakasa basin, Eastern Central Greece, which supports many industrial activities, concentrations of chromium (up to 80 μg/L Cr(VI)) and Inofyta (up to 53 μg/L Cr(VI) were found in the urban water supply of Oropos). Chromium(VI) concentrations ranging from 5 to 33 μg/L Cr(VI) were found in groundwater that is used for Thiva's water supply. Arsenic concentrations up to 34 μg/L along with chromium(VI) levels up to 40 μg/L were detected in Schimatari's water supply. In the Asopos River, total chromium values were up to 13 μg/L, hexavalent chromium was less than 5 μg/L and other toxic elements were relatively low. = Iraq = In 2008, defense contractor KBR was alleged to have exposed 16 members of the Indiana National Guard, as well as its own workers, to hexavalent chromium at the Qarmat Ali water treatment facility in Iraq in 2003.Indiana Guardsmen Sue KBR Over Chemical from Democracy Now!, December 4, 2008 Later, 433 members of the Oregon National Guard's 162nd Infantry Battalion were informed of possible exposure to hexavalent chromium while escorting KBR contractors.Associated Press (February 12, 2009) . \\"Oregon: Possible Chemical Exposure\\".

CNN. Retrieved on November 3, 2012. = United States = History of the EPA’s chromium policies in the United States  Prior to 1970, the federal government had limited reach in monitoring and enforcing environmental regulations. Local governments were tasked with environmental monitoring and regulations, such as the monitoring of heavy metals in wastewater. Examples of this can be seen in larger municipalities such Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York. A specific example was in 1969, the Chicago Metropolitan Sanitary District imposed regulations on factories that were identified as having large amounts of heavy metal discharge. On December 2, 1970 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was formed. With the formation of the EPA, the federal government had the funds and the oversight to influence major environmental changes. Following the formation of the EPA, the United States saw groundbreaking legislation such as the Clean Water Act (1972) and the Safe Drinking Water Act (1974). The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) of 1948 was amended in 1972 to what is more commonly known as the Clean Water Act (CWA). The subsequent amendments provided a basis for the federal government to begin regulating pollutants, implement wastewater standards, and increase funding for water treatment facilities among other things. Two years later, in 1974, the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) was passed by congress. The SDWA aimed to monitor and protect the United States drinking water, and the water sources it is drawn from. As part of the SDWA, in 1991, the EPA placed chromium under its list of maximum contaminant level goals (MCLG), to have a maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 100 ppb. In 1996, the SDWA was amended to include a provision known as the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR). Under this rule, the EPA issues a list of 30 or less contaminants that aren’t normally regulated under the SDWA. Chromium was monitored under the third UCMR, from January 2013 through December 2015. The EPA uses data from these reports to assist in making regulatory decisions.  Current policies in the United States  The current EPA standard in measuring chromium, is in reference to total chromium, both trivalent and hexavalent. Often trivalent and hexavalent chromium are mentioned together, when in fact they are very different from each other. This is an issue because hexavalent chromium can cause cancer, whereas trivalent chromium does not. In 1991, the MCL for chromium exposure was set based on potential of “adverse dermatological effects” related to long-term chromium exposure. Chromium's MCL of 100 ppb has not changed since its 1991 recommendation. In 1998 the EPA released a toxicological review of hexavalent chromium. This report examined current literature, at the time, and came to the conclusion that chromium was associated with various health issues. As of 2012, \\"no federal or state laws restrict the carcinogen's presence in drinking water,\\" according to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). NRDC won a lawsuit against the California Department of Public Health, and the state was required to issue a standard on the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for this chemical. The MCL was added to the California Code of Regulations but, in 2017, another court ruled that the standard must be eliminated because the California Department of Public Health had not proven that the standard was economically feasible. Before the EPA can adjust the policy on chromium levels in drinking water, they have to release a final human health assessment. The EPA mentions two specific documents that are currently under review to determine whether or not to adjust the current drinking water standard for chromium. The first study the EPA mentioned that is under review is a 2008 study conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services National Toxicology Program. This study looks at chronic oral exposure of hexavalent chromium in rats, and its association with cancer. The other study mentioned is a human health assessment of chromium, titled Toxicological Review of Hexavalent Chromium. The final human health assessment is currently in the stage of draft development. This stage is the first of seven. The EPA gives no forecast to when the review will be finalized and if a decision will be made. = Military applications = Since World War II, the U.S. Army relied on hexavalent chromium compounds to protect its vehicles, equipment, aviation and missile systems from corrosion. The wash primer was sprayed as a pretreatment and protective layer on bare metal. From 2012–2015, Army Research Laboratory conducted research on a wash primer replacement, as a part of the DoD's effort to eliminate the use of toxic wash primers in the military. Studies indicated that the wash primers contained hazardous air pollutants and high levels of volatile organic compounds. The project resulted in ARL qualifying three wash primer alternatives in 2015 for use on Army depots, installations and repair facilities. The research led to the removal of chromate products from Army facilities in 2017. ARL's researchers won the fiscal 2016 Secretary of the Army Award for Environmental Excellence in Weapon System Acquisition for their efforts on the wash primer replacement.  Pending regulations in the United States  The EPA currently limits total chromium in drinking water to 100 parts per billion, but there is no established specifically for chromium(VI). In the same year, the California Environmental Protection Agency had proposed a goal of 0.2 parts per billion, despite a 2001 state law requiring a standard be set by 2005. A final Public Health Goal of 0.02 ppb was established in July 2011.  California = Davenport = Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District monitored airborne levels of hexavalent chromium at an elementary school and fire department, as well as the point-source. They concluded that there were high levels of hexavalent chromium in the air, originating from a local cement plant, called Cemex.Health Services Agency. (2008, Nov. 18). Air Quality Issues in the Town of Davenport. Retrieved from: The levels of hexavalent chromium were 8 to 10 times higher than the air district's acceptable level at Pacific Elementary School and the Davenport Fire Department. The County of Santa Cruz sought help of the Health Services Agency (HSA) to investigate the findings of the Air District's report. Cemex voluntarily ceased operations due to the growing concern within the community, while additional air samples were analyzed. The HSA worked with Cemex to implement engineering controls, such as dust scavenging systems and other dust mitigation procedures. Cemex also made a change in the materials they used, trying to replace current materials with materials lower in chromium. The HSA also monitored the surrounding schools to determine if there were any health risks. Most schools came back with low levels, but in the case of higher levels a contractor was hired to clean up the chromium deposits. This case highlights the previously unrecognized possibility that hexavalent chromium can be released from cement-making. = Paramount = In 2016, air quality officials began investigating elevated levels of hexavalent chromium in Paramount, California. The city of Paramount created an action project that included more code enforcement to aid AQMD inspectors and the launch of ParamountEnvironment.org to keep the public informed. Over time, efforts by SCAQMD and the city of Paramount have been effective lowering emissions to acceptable levels. = Hinkley = Hexavalent chromium was found in drinking water in the southern California town of Hinkley and was brought to popular attention by the involvement of Erin Brockovich and Attorney Edward Masry. The source of contamination was from the evaporating ponds of a PG&E; (Pacific Gas and Electric) natural gas pipeline Compressor Station located approximately 2 miles southeast of Hinkley. Between 1952 and 1966, chromium(VI) was used to prevent corrosion in the cooling stacks. The wastewater was then dumped into the unlined evaporating ponds. As a result, the chromium(VI) leaked into the groundwater source. The 580 ppb chromium(VI) in the groundwater in Hinkley exceeded the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 100 ppb for total chromium currently set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It also exceeded the California MCL of 50 ppb (as of November 2008) for all types of chromium. California first established an MCL specifically for hexavalent chromium in 2014, set at 10 ppb. Prior to that only total chromium standards applied. A more recent study found that from 1996 to 2008, 196 cancers were identified among residents of the census tract that included Hinkley—a slightly lower number than the 224 cancers that would have been expected given its demographic characteristics. In June 2013 Mother Jones published an article regarding work by the Center for Public Integrity that was critical of the study, and some others by the same researcher, John Morgan. This comes in contrast with the conclusions reached by the EPA and California's Department of Public Health that chromium(VI) does in fact cause cancer. At the time that a PG&E; background study of chromium(VI) was conducted, average chromium(VI) levels in Hinkley were recorded as 1.19 ppb with a peak of 3.09 ppb. The PG&E; Topock Compressor Station averaged 7.8ppb and peaked at 31.8ppb. The California MCL standard was still at 50 ppb at the completion of this background study. In comparison, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) of the California EPA, proposed a health goal of 0.06 ppb of chromium(VI) in drinking water in 2009. In 2010, Erin Brockovich returned to Hinkley in the midst of claims that the plume was spreading, despite PG&E; cleanup efforts. PG&E; continues to provide bottled water for the residents of Hinkley as well as offer to buy their homes. All other ongoing cleanup documentation is maintained at California EPA's page.  Illinois  In Chicago's first ever testing for the toxic metal contaminant, results show that the city's local drinking water contains levels of hexavalent chromium more than 11 times higher than the health standard set in California in July 2011. The results of the test showed that the water which is sent to over 7 million residents had average levels of 0.23 ppb of the toxic metal. California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment designated the nation's new \\"public health goal\\" limit as 0.02 ppb. Echoing their counterparts in other cities where the metal has been detected, Chicago officials stress that local tap water is safe and suggest that if a national limit is adopted, it likely would be less stringent than California's goal. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (Illinois EPA) has developed a chromium(VI) strategic plan which outlines tasks in order to reduce the levels of chromium(VI) in Illinois' drinking water. One of which is to work with the U.S. EPA to provide significant technical assistance to the City of Chicago to ensure they quickly develop an effective chromium(VI) specific monitoring program that makes use of the U.S. EPA-approved methods.  Massachusetts  Cambridge Plating Company, now known as Purecoat North, was an electroplating business in Belmont, Massachusetts. A report was conducted by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), to evaluate the association between environmental exposures from the Cambridge Plating Company and health effects on the surrounding community. The report indicated that residents of Belmont were exposed to chromium via air emissions, as well as groundwater and soil.Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Public Health Assessment for Cambridge Plating Company. (2007, Dec. 17). Evaluation of Environmental Concerns and Cancer Incidence in Belmont and Surrounding Communities. Retrieved from However, six types of cancer were evaluated, and the incidence was actually found to be average, in most cases, across all types, if not a little bit lower than average. For example, in kidney cancer the number of observed cases was 7 versus an expected 16. While that was the case for most diseases, it was not for all. The incidence of leukemia among females was elevated in Belmont, MA during 1982–1999 (32 diagnoses observed vs. 23.2 expected). Elevations in females were due to four excess cases in each time period (11 diagnoses observed vs. 6.9 expected during 1988–1993; 13 diagnoses observed vs. 8.7 expected during 1994–1999) while elevations among males were based on one to three excess cases. ATSDR deemed Cambridge Plating as an Indeterminate Public Health Hazard in the past, but No Apparent Public Health Hazard in the present or future.  Missouri  In 2009, a lawsuit was filed against Prime Tanning Corporation of St. Joseph, Missouri, over alleged hexavalent chromium contamination in Cameron, Missouri. A cluster of brain tumors had developed in the town that was above average for the population size of the town. The lawsuit alleges that the tumors were caused by waste hexavalent chromium that had been distributed to local farmers as free fertilizer. In 2010 a government study found hexavalent chromium within the soil but not at levels that were hazardous to human health. In 2012, the case ruled that $10 million would be distributed to over a dozen farmers affected in the northwest Missouri area. The Tanning Corporation still denies that their fertilizer caused any harm. Some residents claim that the tumors were a direct cause from the chromium exposure, but it is difficult to determine what other future impacts might arise from exposure in the specific Missouri counties.  Michigan  On December 20, 2019, a green substance leaking onto I-696, in Madison Heights, was identified as hexavalent chromium that had leaked from a basement of a local company, Electro-Plating Services  North Carolina  Dr. Randall W. Williams was appointed as Health Director for the state of North Carolina by Governor Pat McCrory, a 28-year Duke Energy former employee.Former NC health director embroiled in coal ash controversy reportedly hired in Missouri, News & Observer, Lynn Bonner, February 9, 2017. Retrieved June 8, 2019. Williams became embroiled in controversy over the safety of household well water near coal ash ponds. In testimony in May 2016, related to a lawsuit, state toxicologist Ken Rudo said state health and environmental officials including Williams and former Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) Assistant Secretary Tom Reeder, attempted to “play down the risk” of coal ash contamination of their wells. The officials had rescinded a \\"do-not-drink\\" notice sent to some well owners in March 2016. Rudo said in his deposition in the case that the state was informing residents that their household water was safe to drink when it knew it wasn’t. Williams said that he had rescinded those warning notices because he felt they were unnecessarily stirring up alarms. North Carolina's Department of Health and Human Services disagreed with Rudo’s contentions. Megan Davies, a state Division of Public Health epidemiologist who was section chief and Rudo’s supervisor, resigned because of the manner in which the department and McCrory’s administration disputed Rudo’s testimony. Davies and a co-worker testified regarding concerns they held about the state inappropriately rescinding the warning notices.  Texas  On April 8, 2009, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) collected ground water samples from a domestic well on West County Road 112 in Midland, Texas (U.S.), in response to a resident complaint of yellow water. The well was found to be contaminated with chromium(VI). The Midland groundwater reached higher levels of contamination than the EPA mandated maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 100 parts per billion. The current groundwater plume of chromium lies under approximately 260 acres of land at the West County Road 112 Groundwater Site. In response, the TCEQ installed filtration systems on water-well sites that showed contamination of chromium. As of 2016, TCEQ had sampled water from 235 wells and has installed over 45 anion-exchange filtration systems from this site determined to be centered at 2601 West County Road 112, Midland, Texas. The TCEQ continues to sample wells surrounding the area to monitor the movement of the plume. In addition, they continue to monitor the effectiveness of the anion-exchange filtration systems by sampling on a year-quarterly and the filters are maintained at no cost to the residents. As of March 2011, the West County Road 112 Ground Water site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) also known as the Superfund List by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). From 2011 to 2013, TCEQ installed groundwater monitors and conducted groundwater sampling. In 2013, TCEQ began sampling residential soil and confirmed that it was contaminated from use of the contaminated groundwater for garden and lawn care. According to the EPA, ongoing investigations have not concluded the source of the contamination and cleanup solutions are still being developed. Until such investigations are complete and remediation established, residents will continue to be at risk for health effects from exposure to the groundwater contamination.  Wisconsin  On January 7, 2011 it was announced that Milwaukee, Wisconsin had tested its water and hexavalent chromium was found to be present. Officials stated that it was in such small quantities that it was nothing to worry about, although this contaminant is a carcinogen. In Wisconsin, Milwaukee's average chromium(VI) level is 0.194 parts per billion (the EPA recommended maximum contaminant level (MCL) is 100 ppb). All 13 water systems tested positive for chromium(VI). Four out of seven systems detected the chemical in Waukesha County, and both Racine and Kenosha Counties had the highest levels averaging more than 0.2 parts per billion. Further testing was being conducted as of 2011.City defends water safety Milwaukee Wisconsin Journal Sentinel, January 7, 2011 There was no further information available as of October 2016.

It was published on December 18, 1787 under the pseudonym Publius, the name under which all The Federalist papers were published. One of the more significant essays in the series, No. 23 attempts to justify the increased strength of the federal government under the proposed United States Constitution, compared to the then-active Articles of Confederation. The paper is entitled \\"The Necessity of a Government as Energetic as the One Proposed to the Preservation of the Union\\". Critics of the Constitution, particularly the Anti-Federalists who opposed the expansion of federal power, brought many counterarguments against Hamilton's position. Though they failed to carry the day, as the Constitution was indeed ratified, their concern about the federal government being too powerful motivated the Bill of Rights, particularly the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The question In the first 22 Federalist papers, Publius argued for the importance of the Union and that the Articles of Confederation were insufficient to preserve the Union. Federalist No. 23 begins a series of fourteen papers arguing in support of the basic thesis that an energetic federal government is necessary. Too-powerful governments were a major worry in America, which had declared independence from Britain partly because of a belief that the government in London inappropriately had dominated the local governments in the colonies. Hamilton tried to allay popular fears that the new federal government would be no less abusive than the British government had been. Publius' argument Hamilton identifies the principal purposes of the Union: \\"The common defence of the members—the preservation of the public peace as well against internal convulsions as external attacks—the regulation of commerce with other nations and between the States—the superintendence of our intercourse, political and commercial, with foreign countries.\\" For the common defense, Hamilton focuses on the ability to raise and direct armies and fleets. He invokes a central principle of proportionality of means to ends: \\"the means ought to be proportional to the end; the persons from whose agency the attainment of any end is expected ought to possess the means by which it is attained.\\" Accordingly, he argues that if the federal government is tasked with the common defense, it must have complete power to raise and direct military forces. By contrast, under the Articles of Confederation the federal government had to requisition supplies and troops from the states. The new Constitution resolved this issue by allowing the Union to levy troops and build fleets. To give the federal government less than complete power, Hamilton argued, would be \\"improvidently to trust the great interests of the nation to hands which are disabled from managing them with vigor and success.\\" Also, a common defense is vital to the preservation of the Union because \\"it is impossible to foresee or define the extent and variety of national exigencies.\\" Any unforeseeable attack from foreign powers is imminent.

The conjugate base of squaric acid is the hydrogensquarate anion ; and the conjugate base of the hydrogensquarate anion is the divalent squarate anion . This is one of the oxocarbon anions, which consist only of carbon and oxygen. Squaric acid is a reagent for chemical synthesis, used for instance to make photosensitive squaraine dyes and inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatases. Chemical properties Squaric acid is a white crystalline powder. The onset of thermal decomposition depends on the different thermodynamic conditions such as heating rates. The structure of squaric acid is not a perfect square, as the carbon–carbon bond lengths are not quite equal. The high acidity with pKa = 1.5 for the first proton and pKa = 3.4 for the second is attributable to resonance stabilization of the anion. Because the negative charges are equally distributed between each oxygen atom, the dianion of squaric acid is completely symmetrical (unlike squaric acid itself) with all C−C bond lengths identical and all C−O bond lengths identical. Derivatives Many of the reactions of squaric acid involve the OH groups. The molecule behaves as a strong dicarboxylic acid. It is stronger acid than typical carboxylic acids. :C4O2(OH)2 → [C4O3(OH)]- \\\\+ H+ pK = 1.5 :[C4O3(OH)]- → [C4O4]2- \\\\+ H+ pK = 3.5 The OH groups are labile in squaric acid. It forms a dichloride with thionyl chloride: :C4O2(OH)2 \\\\+ 2 SOCl2 → C4O2Cl2 \\\\+ 2 HCl + 2 SO2 The chlorides are good leaving groups, remininscent of acid chlorides. They are displaced by diverse nucleophiles. In this way dithiosquarate can been prepared. The bis(methylether) is prepared by alkylation with trimethyl orthoformate. Squaramides are prepared by displacement of alkoxy or chloride groups from C4O2X2 (X = OR, Cl). One or both of the oxygen (=O) groups in the squarate anion can be replaced by dicyanomethylene =C(CN)2. The resulting anions, such as 1,2-bis(dicyanomethylene)squarate and 1,3-bis(dicyanomethylene)squarate, retain the aromatic character of squarate and have been called pseudo- oxocarbon anions. Photolysis of squaric acid in a solid argon matrix at affords acetylenediol. =Coordination complexes= Squarate dianion behaves similarly to oxalate, forming mono- and polynuclear complexes with hard metal ions. Cobalt(II) squarate hydrate Co(C4O4)(H2O)2 (yellow, cubic) can be prepared by autoclaving cobalt(II) hydroxide and squaric acid in water at 200 °C. The water is bound to the cobalt atom, and the crystal structure consists of a cubic arrangement of hollow cells, whose walls are either six squarate anions (leaving a 7 Å wide void) or several water molecules (leaving a 5 Å void). Cobalt(II) squarate dihydroxide Co3(OH)2(C4O4)2·3H2O (brown) is obtained together with the previous compound. It has a columnar structure including channels filled with water molecules; these can be removed and replaced without destroying the crystal structure. The chains are ferromagnetic; they are coupled antiferromagnetically in the hydrated form, ferromagnetically in the anhydrous form. Copper(II) squarate monomeric and dimeric mixed-ligand complexes were synthesized and characterizedReinprecht, J. T.; Miller, J. G.; Vogel, G. C.; et al. (1979). \\"Synthesis and Characterization of Copper(II) Squarate Complexes\\". Inorg. Chem., 19, 927-931. Infrared, electronic and Q-Band EPR spectra as well as magnetic susceptibilities are reported. The same method yields iron(II) squarate dihydroxide Fe2(OH)2(C4O4) (light brown).  Syntheses  The original synthesis started with the ethanolysis of perfluorocyclobutene to give 1,2-diethoxy-3,3,4,4-tetrafluoro-1-cyclobutene. Hydrolysis gives the squaric acid. Although impractical, squarate and related anions such deltate and acetylenediolate are obtainable by reductive coupling of carbon monoxide using organouranium complexes. Medical uses Medically, SADBE or squaric acid dibutyl ester or dibutyl squarate derives from a squaric acid. is used for the treatment of warts. Squaric acid dibutyl ester is also used for treating alopecia areata or alopecia totalis (autoimmune hair loss) through topical immunotherapy involving the production of an allergic rash. Squaric acid dibutylester is currently undergoing trials for use in treating herpes labialis (cold sores).http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01971385 Diethylsquarate was utilized in the synthesis of Perzinfotel.

Functions It plays a key role in chain elongation in fatty acid biosynthesis and polyketide biosynthesis. =Fatty acid biosynthesis= In the former, it provides 2-carbon units to fatty acids and commits them to fatty acid chain synthesis. Malonyl-CoA is formed by carboxylating acetyl-CoA using the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase. One molecule of acetyl-CoA joins with a molecule of bicarbonate,Nelson D, Cox M (2008) Lehninger principles of biochemistry. 5th Ed: p. 806 requiring energy rendered from ATP. Malonyl-CoA is utilised in fatty acid biosynthesis by the enzyme malonyl coenzyme A:acyl carrier protein transacylase (MCAT). MCAT serves to transfer malonate from malonyl-CoA to the terminal thiol of holo-acyl carrier protein (ACP). =Polyketide biosynthesis= MCAT is also involved in bacterial polyketide biosynthesis. The enzyme MCAT together with an acyl carrier protein (ACP), and a polyketide synthase (PKS) and chain-length factor heterodimer, constitutes the minimal PKS of type II polyketides. =Regulation= Malonyl-CoA is a highly regulated molecule in fatty acid synthesis; as such, it inhibits the rate-limiting step in beta-oxidation of fatty acids. Malonyl-CoA inhibits fatty acids from associating with carnitine by regulating the enzyme carnitine acyltransferase, thereby preventing them from entering the mitochondria, where fatty acid oxidation and degradation occur.

Retrieved March 8, 2011 from HighBeam Research. (born April 10, 1944) is an American television producer of the television shows MacGyver, Entertainment Tonight, and America's Funniest Home Videos. He runs an eponymous production company called Vin Di Bona Productions. In 2010, Di Bona launched a second business, FishBowl Worldwide Media, an independent production company developing properties for film, television, digital platforms and brands. Early life A native of Cranston, Rhode Island,Emily Benedek. \\"How the 'Funniest' Thing Happened; Vin Di Bona, Making 'Home Videos' Into a Sunday-Night Smash.\\", The Washington Post, April 3, 1990. Retrieved March 7, 2011 from HighBeam Research. Di Bona began his career in the entertainment industry as a singer, under the stage name Johnny Lindy (the last name was taken from the Cranston area restaurant owned by his parents and where Di Bona worked as a pre-teen); releasing two records by the age of 16, which became hits regionally. However Di Bona turned his aspirations to making film and television in 1962, later saying \\"Guys who sang romantic ballads were up a creek without a paddle. So I adapted.\\" Personal life In 2006, Di Bona married Erica Gerard, a television production executive he had known from his days at CBS. He has a daughter, Cara Di Bona Swartz and a step-daughter, Jamie Goldstein. Education  He received an education at Emerson College in Boston, where he served as manager of WECB, the campus radio station. Di Bona met his first wife, Gina, with whom he has a daughter, Cara. After graduating from Emerson in 1966 and earning a Master of Fine Arts degree in film at UCLA, he worked for nine years at Boston's then-NBC affiliate, WBZ-TV (channel 4; now a CBS- owned station). Career After he left WBZ-TV, Vin moved with his family to Los Angeles. Di Bona did not find a job for about eight months but finally became employed at CBS directing and producing documentaries, which earned him four Emmys and a Peabody Award. Di Bona is considered one of the pioneers of reality TV, thanks to Battle of the Network Stars, which Di Bona produced in 1976. By the 1980s, Di Bona had become a producer for the syndicated newsmagazine Entertainment Tonight and later served as a producer for one season on the ABC series MacGyver; he was also a director for the American Music Awards and the Academy of Country Music Awards and produced taped segments for the 36th Annual Emmy Awards, among others. He also produced a short lived children's cartoon titled Tea Time with Space Dinosaur. Di Bona's first two television series creations were spawned from Japanese programs. Di Bona developed the ABC series Animal Crack-Ups, based on a popular Tokyo Broadcasting System game show called Waku Waku. America's Funniest Home Videos was inspired by another Tokyo Broadcasting System series, the variety show Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan. America's Funniest Home Videos, currently in its 29th year and the longest-running primetime entertainment show on ABC, reached a milestone 600 episodes in 2017. The show eventually led to three spinoffs, America's Funniest People, the short-lived World's Funniest Videos, and Videos After Dark; along with similar home video shows Show Me The Funny for Fox Family Channel (later ABC Family, now Freeform) and the syndicated series That's Funny. Di Bona also produced several made-for-TV movies and a Showtime series, Sherman Oaks. In 1991, Di Bona secured the rights to produce a revival of Candid Camera; Allen Funt, who owned the rights to the show and agreed to the deal mainly because he needed the money, later spoke out against the revival in his 1994 autobiography. Funt stated that Di Bona had overused product placement and that neither he nor his choice of host, Dom DeLuise, grasped the concept of the show. Di Bona was chair for The Caucus for Television Producers, Writers and Directors for four years. Having served for many years on the Board of Trustees for his alma mater, Emerson College, he is now the Board's vice-chairman. He is also chairman of Emerson's 2013 fund- raising committee and donated one million dollars to kick-start the effort. Di Bona received the 2,346th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Thursday, August 23, 2007. In 2009, objects from America's Funniest Home Videos were accepted into the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, including the camcorder used to shoot the first winning video in 1989. Vin Di Bona is executive producer of Upload with Shaquille O'Neal, which features the basketball superstar and TNT NBA analyst Shaquille O'Neal. The show consists of O'Neal and friends rounding up the week's online video clips, as well as creating their own viral videos and commenting on and parodying current pop culture stories. The TruTV show also counts executive producers Bruce Gersh, Susan Levison, attorney-executive producer Ellen Stiefler, and writer- executive producer Yahlin Chang among its staff. Vin Di Bona is bringing Dr. Mimi Guarneri's book The Heart Speaks to television at ABC as a weekly medical television drama with Sony Pictures Television. Controversy In 1992, Arleen Sorkin, who is white, was fired as co-host from the television show America's Funniest People by Di Bona. In response, Sorkin filed a lawsuit against Di Bona, claiming that she was dismissed from the show due to her race, after ABC Chairman Dan Burke had suggested to Di Bona that Sorkin be replaced by an African-American or a person of another ethnic minority. Sorkin sought $450,000 for lost earnings and an additional unspecified amount for harm to her professional reputation and emotional injury. Sorkin additionally claimed that after she denounced the move as unfair, Di Bona changed plans and hired new cohost Tawny Kitaen, who is also white. In an interview for Ben Shapiro's Primetime Propaganda, Di Bona was asked if the accusation by many conservatives that \\"Hollywood is a leftist town\\" and leftist political perspectives dominate scripted television shows was accurate. Di Bona responded that it is \\"probably accurate, and I'm happy about it.\\" This was a double-barreled question, however, because it asked if Hollywood is a politically left-wing town and if leftist ideologies dominate scripted shows. Shapiro used Di Bona's answer as evidence in his book that producers, executives and writers in the entertainment industry discriminate against conservatives and are using television to promote a socialist political agenda. Di Bona responded by accusing \\"Shapiro of misrepresentation, saying he never revealed his political agenda.\\" In March 2019, DiBona's two production companies, Vin Di Bona Entertainment, Inc. and Fishbowl Worldwide Media, Inc., along with individual defendant Phil Shafran, were sued for sexual harassment, sexual assault, and retaliation by three former female employees. The lawsuit, Case No. 19STCV09487 is pending in Los Angeles Superior Court.

Carl Anton Joseph Rottmann (11 January 1797, Handschuhsheim – 7 July 1850, Munich) was a German landscape painter and the most famous member of the Rottmann family of painters. Rottmann belonged to the circle of artists around King Ludwig I of Bavaria, who commissioned large landscape paintings exclusively from him. He is best known for mythical and heroising landscapes. The landscape painter belonged to his school. Biography Rottmann was born in Handschuhsheim (today a part of Heidelberg) on 11 January 1797. There he received his first drawing lessons from his father, , who taught drawing at the university in Heidelberg. He formed himself chiefly through the study of nature and of great masterworks. In his first artistic period, he painted atmospheric phenomena. After gaining prominence with Heidelberg at Sunset (a water color), and Castle Eltz, he settled in Munich in 1822 and devoted himself to Bavarian scenery. Here his second period began, and in 1824 he married Friedericke, the daughter of his uncle, Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell, who served as an attendant at court. Through this connection, he made the acquaintance of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, who in 1826/27 sponsored his travels in Italy in order to widen his repertoire, which up to that point consisted solely of domestic, German, landscapes. In Italy, Rottmann made sketches for the 28 Italian landscapes in fresco which he was commissioned to paint in the arcades of the Hofgarten at Munich. The cycle, completed in 1833, gave visual expression to Ludwig's alliance with Italy, and raised the genre of landscape painting to the height of history painting, the preferred mode of the King's other great commissions for monumental painting. The frescos unfortunately deteriorated under climatic influences. The cartoons for them are in the Darmstadt Gallery. In 1834 Rottmann traveled to Greece to prepare for a commission from Ludwig for a second cycle; one might mark here the beginning of his third period. At first also intended for the Hofgarten arcade, the 23 great landscapes were eventually installed in the newly built Neue Pinakothek where they were given their own hall. Of his easel pictures, Ammer Lake and Marathon are in the National Gallery, Berlin; The Acropolis of Sikyon and Corfu in the Pinakothek, Munich; others in the Schack Gallery, Munich, and in Karlsruhe; and seven in the Leipzig Museum. Carl Rottmann died on 7 July 1850 in Munich, aged 53 of undisclosed causes. He is buried in the Alter Südfriedhof in Munich.

In September 2001, First Union completed a merger with Wachovia National Bank to become Wachovia Corporation, one of the largest financial holding companies in the US. As of the end of 2000, First Union had over $171 billion of total assets, over 70,000 employees and 2,193 branches. History First Union Corporation was founded as Union National Bank on June 2, 1908, a small banking desk in the lobby of a hotel in Charlotte, North Carolina, by H. M. Victor. The bank merged with First National Bank and Trust Company of Asheville in 1958 to become First Union National Bank of North Carolina. In 1964, the bank added Cameron-Brown company, a mortgage banking and insurance firm. First Union Corporation was incorporated in 1967. In February 1968, Cameron-Brown Co., a $10 billion mortgage banker created in 1955 from the merger of Fidelity Bond & Mortgage Co. (started in 1946 in Raleigh) and Brown-Hamel Mortgage Co. of Greensboro, changed its name to First Union Mortgage Corp. to match its parent company. As part of a corporate reorganization in 1968, a predecessor of First Union National Bank and First Union Mortgage Corporation, the mortgage banking firm acquired in 1964 became subsidiaries of First Union Corp creating the structure the bank utilized until the 2001 merger. Starting in 1985, with the Supreme Court decision upholding regional interstate banking legislation, First Union focused on an aggressive growth strategy and from 1985 through the merger with Wachovia in 2001, First Union completed over 90 banking-related acquisitions, 50 of which were completed between 1985 and 1995. Atlantic National Bank of Jacksonville, Florida, merged with First Union in 1985. In a deal announced in June 1992, First Union acquired South Carolina Federal Corp., making First Union the third largest bank in South Carolina by deposits, but also giving North Carolina-based banks the majority of financial institution assets in South Carolina, something that had never happened in any state since regional banking began in 1986.Jack Scism, \\"Bill Would Tax Banks an Extra $65 Million\\", Greensboro News & Record, June 22, 1992. In 1995, First Union acquired First Fidelity of Newark, New Jersey to expand into the Northeast. =CoreStates= In April 1998, First Union acquired CoreStates Financial Corporation, headquartered in Philadelphia. At the time, this was the largest merger in US banking history. CoreStates traced its history to 1781 and the Bank of North America, the first bank chartered in the United States. Once the merger finalized, First Union claimed 1781 as its founding date. It continued to operate The Bank of North America's first branch at Sixth and Chestnut in Philadelphia which opened in 1782. It is now the longest continuously operated branch in America and through subsequent mergers is now part of Wells Fargo. The acquisition of CoreStates brought problems. Many of these arose when First Union attempted to integrate the CoreStates and First Union computer systems too rapidly. Initially, CoreStates’ tellers received insufficient training with the new First Union systems and the two systems were unable to communicate with each other. This led to problems with account access and payments not correctly applied to loans. =Bowles Hollowell Conner= First Union acquired Bowles Hollowell Conner & Co. on April 30, 1998 adding to its merger and acquisition, high yield, leveraged finance, equity underwriting, private placement, loan syndication, risk management, and public finance capabilities. =The Money Store= On June 30, 1998, First Union paid $2.1 billion for The Money Store, a specialist in home equity loans known for its commercials featuring Baseball Hall of Fame shortstop Phil Rizutto and pitcher Jim Palmer. Two years later, it closed the unit, writing off $1.7 billion in losses. =Acquisition of Wachovia= First Union Bank Tower in Jacksonville, Florida. On April 16, 2001, First Union announced it would merge with Wachovia. This was viewed with great surprise by the financial press and security analysts. While Wachovia had been viewed as an acquisition candidate after running into problems with earnings and credit quality in 2000, the suitor shocked analysts as many speculated that Wachovia would be sold to Atlanta-based SunTrust. As an important part of the deal, while First Union was the nominal survivor, the merged company would assume the Wachovia identity and stock ticker symbol (though it retained First Union's pre-2001 stock price history). Analysts said this move was most likely to help First Union acquire a new identity, as Wachovia's reputation was far better with consumers than First Union. At the same time, Wachovia's name and corporate identity would survive. The deal met with skepticism and criticism. Analysts, remembering the problems with the CoreStates acquisition, were concerned First Union's ability to merge with another large company. Winston-Salem's citizens and politicians suffered a blow to their civic pride because the merged company would be based in Charlotte, home to First Union. City leaders were concerned both by job losses and the loss of stature from losing a major corporate headquarters. First Union was concerned by the potential deposit attrition and customer loss in the city.\\"Wachovia and First Union announce Winston-Salem as base for the new Wachovia's Wealth Management Business\\" Wachovia press release, August 30, 2001 First Union responded to these concerns by placing the wealth management and Carolinas-region headquarters in Winston-Salem. On May 14, 2001, SunTrust announced a rival takeover bid for Wachovia, the first hostile takeover attempt in the banking sector in many years. In its effort to make the deal appeal to investors, SunTrust argued that it would provide a smoother transition than First Union and offered a higher cash price for Wachovia stock than First Union. Wachovia's board of directors rejected SunTrust's offer and supported the merger with First Union. SunTrust continued its hostile takeover attempt, leading to a bitter battle over the summer between SunTrust and First Union. Both banks increased their offers for Wachovia, took out newspaper ads, mailed letters to shareholders, and initiated court battles to challenge each other's takeover bids. On August 3, 2001, Wachovia shareholders approved the First Union deal, rejecting SunTrust's attempts to elect a new board of directors for Wachovia and ending SunTrust's hostile takeover attempt. Another issue concerned each bank's credit card division. In April 2001, Wachovia agreed to sell its $8 billion credit card portfolio to Bank One. The cards, which would have still been branded as Wachovia, would have been issued through Bank One's First USA division. First Union sold its credit card portfolio to MBNA in August 2000. After entering into negotiations, the new Wachovia agreed to buy back its portfolio from Bank One in September 2001 and resell it to MBNA. Wachovia paid Bank One a $350 million termination fee. On September 4, 2001, First Union and Wachovia formally merged to form the new Wachovia Corporation. In order to prevent a repeat of the CoreStates problems, the new Wachovia phased the conversion of Wachovia computer systems into the First Union systems. The company first began converting systems in the southeast United States, where both banks had branches, before moving to the Northeast, where First Union branches only had to change their signs to reflect the new company name and logo. This process ended on August 18, 2003, almost two years after the merger took place. When Wachovia and First Union merged, Charlotte's One, Two, and Three First Union buildings became One, Two, and Three Wachovia Center (respectively), and the 55-story First Union Financial Center in downtown Miami became the Wachovia Financial Center. The merger also affected the names of the indoor professional sports arenas in Philadelphia and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Formerly known as the First Union Center and the First Union Spectrum (both Philadelphia) and First Union Arena (Wilkes-Barre), they became the Wachovia Center, Wachovia Spectrum, and Wachovia Arena at Casey Plaza, respectively. In 2010, following Wachovia's merger into Wells Fargo, the Spectrum was demolished and the other venues became the Wells Fargo Center and the Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza.

The ACPs are related in structure and mechanism to the peptidyl carrier proteins (PCP) from nonribosomal peptide synthases. The protein is expressed in the inactive apo form and the 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety must be post-translationally attached to a conserved serine residue on the ACP by the action of holo-acyl carrier protein synthase (ACPS), a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase. 4'-Phosphopantetheine is an essential prosthetic group of several acyl carrier proteins involved in pathways of primary and secondary metabolism including the acyl carrier proteins (ACP) of fatty acid synthases, ACPs of polyketide synthases, and peptidyl carrier proteins (PCP) and aryl carrier proteins (ArCP) of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). Phosphopantetheine fulfills two demands in these biosynthetic pathways. First, the intermediates remain covalently linked to the synthases (or synthetases) in an energy-rich linkage. Second, the flexibility and length of the phosphopantetheine chain (approximately 2 nm) allows the covalently tethered intermediates to have access to spatially distinct enzyme-active sites. This increases the effective molarity of the intermediate and allows an assembly line-like process. The ACPs are small negatively charged α-helical bundle proteins with a high degree of structural and amino acid similarity. The structures of a number of acyl carrier proteins have been solved using various NMR and crystallography techniques.

The Act was the Labour Government's third attempt to bring in this offence: provisions were originally included as part of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill in 2001, but were dropped after objections from the House of Lords. The measure was again brought forward as part of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill in 2004-5, but was again dropped in order to get the body of that Bill passed before the 2005 general election. The Act is notable because two amendments made in the House of Lords failed to be overturned by the Government in the House of Commons. Most of the Act came into force on 1 October 2007. Previous attempts at legislation After the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the Government in Britain brought forward the Anti- Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill. Clause 38 of that Bill would have had the effect of amending Part 3 of the Public Order Act 1986 to extend the existing provisions on incitement to racial hatred to cover incitement to religious hatred. When the Bill reached the House of Lords, an amendment to remove the clause was passed by 240 votes to 141. The Commons reinstated the clause, but the Lords again removed it. Finally, the then Home Secretary, David Blunkett, accepted that the Commons had to accede to the Lords' insistence that the clause be left out of the Bill. The government brought the proposal back before Parliament in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill in the Session leading up to the general election in May 2005. During the Lords debate on the relevant section of the Bill, on 5 April 2005 (the day on which the general election was called), the provision was removed. When the Bill returned to the Commons on 7 April, the Government announced that it was dropping the measure so as to secure the passage of the Bill as a whole before the Dissolution of Parliament. At the general election, the Labour Party confirmed that, were it to be re-elected, it would bring in a Bill to outlaw incitement to religious hatred: \\"It remains our firm intention to give people of all faiths the same protection against incitement to hatred on the basis of their religion. We will legislate to outlaw it and will continue the dialogue we have started with faith groups from all backgrounds about how best to balance protection, tolerance and free speech\\".Labour Party manifesto, Forward not back (2005), p111-112 Controversy The Act amends the Public Order Act 1986 as follows: *Section 29A **Meaning of \\"religious hatred\\" ***In this Part \\"religious hatred\\" means hatred against a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief or lack of religious belief. *Section 29B: **(1) A person who uses threatening words or behaviour, or displays any written material which is threatening, is guilty of an offence if he intends thereby to stir up religious hatred. The Government's plan was simply to add 'or religious' after 'racial' in the existing law, which would then have penalised use of 'threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour'. Critics of the Bill (before the removal of the words 'abusive or insulting ' and the addition of a requirement for the intention of stirring up religious hatred) asserted that the Act would make major religious works such as the Bible and the Quran illegal in their current form in the UK. Comedians and satirists also feared prosecution for their work. While sympathising with those who promoted the legislation, actor and comedian Rowan Atkinson said: \\"I appreciate that this measure is an attempt to provide comfort and protection to them but unfortunately it is a wholly inappropriate response far more likely to promote tension between communities than tolerance.\\" Leaders of major religions and race groups spoke out against the Bill, as did non-religious groups such as the National Secular Society, English PEN and Humanists UK (who had since 2001 been pointing to the vital differences between ethnicity and religion when the context was restricting freedom of speech). Supporters of the Bill responded that all UK legislation has to be interpreted in the light of the Human Rights Act 1998, which guarantees freedom of religion and expression, and so denied that an Act of Parliament is capable of making any religious text illegal. The House of Lords passed amendments to the Bill on 25 October 2005 which have the effect of limiting the legislation to \\"A person who uses threatening words or behaviour, or displays any written material which is threatening... if he intends thereby to stir up religious hatred\\". This removed the abusive and insulting concept, and required the intention – not just the possibility – of stirring up religious hatred. The Government attempted to overturn these changes, but lost the House of Commons votes on 31 January 2006. History * 11 July 2005 – The bill was passed by the House of Commons and was passed up to the House of Lords. * 11 October 2005 – The bill was read by the House of Lords as a 300-strong group of protesters demonstrated in Hyde Park. Forty- seven Lords spoke in the debate, of whom nine came out in support of the bill. * 25 October 2005 – The House of Lords passed amendments to the Bill. * 31 January 2006 – The Commons agreed to an amendment from the House of Lords by 288 to 278, contrary to the position of the Government. A second Lords amendment was approved by 283 votes to 282 in the absence of Prime Minister Tony Blair, who had apparently underestimated support for the amendment. This made the bill the Labour government's second (and third) defeat since the 2005 election. The Tories' strategy to win the vote was inspired by \\"A Good Day\\", an episode of American television series The West Wing. * 16 February 2006 – The Bill received Royal Assent to become the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 c. 1. * 1 October 2007 – The act came partially into force with the publication of a Statutory Instrument.

The district consists mostly of wooden houses, separated by narrow streets paved with cobblestones. It is widely considered one of the most beautiful residential districts in the whole of Finland, and has received an award to that effect in 2001. Port Arthur is one of the most expensive districts in Turku to live in. The district was originally built in the 1900s as a residential area for workers. It was inadvertently named after the city of Port Arthur (now Lüshunkou, China) that Imperial Russia (which ruled Finland at the time) lost during the Russo- Japanese War in 1904. Local children asked the workmen what they were doing; their reply of \\"rebuilding Port Arthur\\" caught on among the citizenry Attempts by the city council to build tenements in the area in the 1970s failed due to strong opposition from locals.

The International Show Caves Association (I.S.C.A.), accessed 24 July 2017 A show cave may be managed by a government or commercial organization and made accessible to the general public, usually for an entrance fee. Unlike wild caves, they may possess regular opening hours, guided group tours, constructed trails and stairs, color artificial illumination and other lighting, musical/video/laser shows and concerts, elevators, small trains, and boats if they contain underground water features. Some caves (mainly in Asia) open to the public have temples, monasteries and religious statues or monuments. Some caves are visited by millions of tourists annually. The term is used inconsistently between nations: many countries tend to call all caves which are open to the public show caves. However, there are many caves which are not developed with trails, light and tours, which are visited by very many people. This kind of cave is often called a semi-wild cave. Access may involve anything between an easy stroll and dangerous climbing. Most cave accidents happen in this kind of cave, as visitors underestimate the difficulties and dangers. History A small chair train to Postojna Cave, Slovenia A mini-metro train to New Athos Cave, Georgia Boats to Glyfada Cave/Dirou Pyrgos Caves, Greece The oldest known show cave in the world is probably Reed Flute Cave in China with inscriptions from 792 in the time of the T'ang Dynasty. Other old show caves are Postojna Cave in Slovenia, with the presumed first record of a cave tour in 1213. Other early show caves are Jasovská jaskyňa in Slovakia with inscriptions from 1452, the Sontheimer Höhle in Germany which was reportedly visited by Herzog Ulrich von Württemberg on 20 May 1516 and Vilenica Cave in Slovenia where entrance fees were taken from 1633 on. In 1649, the first \\"authorized\\" cave guide started guiding Baumannshöhle in the Harz in Germany though this cave was intensively visited much earlier. The development of electric lighting enabled the illumination of show caves. Early experiments with electric light in caves were carried out by Lieutenant Edward Cracknel in 1880 at Chifley Cave, Jenolan Caves, Australia. In 1881, Sloupsko-Šošůvské Jeskyně, Czech Republic, became the first cave in the world with electric arc light. This light did not use light bulbs, but electric arc lamps with carbon electrodes, which burned down and had to be replaced after some time. The first cave in the world with electric light bulbs as we know them today was the Kraushöhle in Austria in 1883. But the light was abandoned after only seven years and the cave is today visited with carbide lamps. In 1884, two more caves were equipped with electric light, Postojna Cave, Slovenia, and Olgahöhle, Germany. Because of the unwanted development of (algae attracted to heat and light) around incandescent electric lights in show caves, many of these attractions, such as Ingleborough Cave in England, have switched to cooler-temperature LED lighting.

A fast- medium right-arm bowler, in a first-class career with Derbyshire that ran from 1983 to 1994 he took 434 wickets at a good average of 23.88. Playing career He was 25 when he went to England to play cricket in 1983. He immediately established himself in the Derbyshire side and took 66 wickets at 24.31. Wisden that year described him as \\"accurate, hostile and, above all, a bowler of unquenchable spirit\\".Wisden 1984, p. 340. It was his most successful season, and also included his best innings and match figures, when in his seventh first-class match he took 6 for 27 and 5 for 62 to help Derbyshire beat Yorkshire by 22 runs at Sheffield.Wisden 1984, p. 608. In 1988 injury restricted him to 12 matches, but he topped the national first-class bowling averages with 34 wickets at 13.64. He was especially economical in one-day cricket, and in 1990, when Derbyshire won the Refuge Assurance League 40-over competition, he was the most economical bowler in the whole competition. In 1985 his first contract with Derbyshire expired. Carlsberg the Danish brewers attempted to sign him on behalf of Northamptonshire (where they had their UK base) and offering to double their countryman's wage. \\"Stan\\", as his team- mates knew him, decided to stay at Derby because he \\"felt that we were going places under Kim Barnett's leadership and sincerely believed we were going to win some trophies\\". He was a genuine tail-ender. The only time he exceeded 40 he made 74 not out against Yorkshire at Chesterfield in 1987, putting on 151 for the ninth wicket with Reg Sharma (who made his only first-class century). For Denmark, Mortensen appeared in four ICC Trophy tournaments (1979, 1986, 1990 and 1994), claiming 63 wickets at a mere 10.41 apiece, including a return of 7-19 in a one-sided match against Israel (who were bowled out for 45) in Nairobi in 1994. Mortensen earned the nickname \\"Stan\\" while playing for Derbyshire, a reference to the famous England football player of the 1940s and 1950s, Stan Mortensen. He earned another nickname \\"Eric Bloodaxe\\" for his ability to swear in Danish. This cricketing Viking was caricatured in 1994 by Pete Sellman. Mortensen played for Ellerslie Cricket Club in Auckland, New Zealand in the 1983/84 New Zealand season, helping Ellerslie win a club one day tournament at Eden Park. From the 1984/85 English off-season Mortensen played for Brighton Cricket Club in Melbourne, Australia, taking 401 wickets at 13.00. He represented Victoria against South Australia in a Christmas game which is an honour and probably his greatest achievement was to win the \\"R. M.

It is implemented through a system call, jail(2), as well as a userland utility, jail(8), plus, depending on the system, a number of other utilities. The functionality was committed into FreeBSD in 1999 by Poul-Henning Kamp after some period of production use by a hosting provider, and was first released with FreeBSD 4.0, thus being supported on a number of FreeBSD descendants, including DragonFly BSD, to this day. The need for the FreeBSD jails came from a small shared-environment hosting provider's (R&D; Associates, Inc.'s owner, Derrick T. Woolworth) desire to establish a clean, clear-cut separation between their own services and those of their customers, mainly for security and ease of administration (jail(8)). Instead of adding a new layer of fine-grained configuration options, the solution adopted by Poul-Henning Kamp was to compartmentalize the system – both its files and its resources – in such a way that only the right people are given access to the right compartments. History Jails were first introduced in FreeBSD version 4.0, that was released on . Most of the original functionality is supported on DragonFly, and several of the new features have been ported as well. Goals FreeBSD jails mainly aim at three goals: # Virtualization: Each jail is a virtual environment running on the host machine with its own files, processes, user and superuser accounts. From within a jailed process, the environment is almost indistinguishable from a real system. # Security: Each jail is sealed from the others, thus providing an additional level of security. # Ease of delegation: The limited scope of a jail allows system administrators to delegate several tasks which require superuser access without handing out complete control over the system. Unlike chroot jail, which restricts processes to a particular view of the filesystem, the FreeBSD jail mechanism restricts the activities of a process in a jail with respect to the rest of the system. In effect, jailed processes are sandboxed. They are bound to specific IP addresses, and a jailed process cannot access divert or routing sockets. Raw sockets are also disabled by default, but may be enabled by setting the \`security.jail.allow_raw_sockets\` sysctl option. Additionally, interaction between processes that are not running in the same jail is restricted. The utility and system call first appeared in FreeBSD 4.0. New utilities (for example to list jails) and system calls (for example to attach a new process to a jail) that render jail management much easier were added in FreeBSD 5.1. The jail subsystem received further significant updates with FreeBSD 7.2, including support for multiple IPv4 and IPv6 addresses per jail and support for binding jails to specific CPUs. =Virtualization= With it is possible to create various virtual machines, each having its own set of utilities installed and its own configuration. This makes it a safe way to try out software. For example, it is possible to run different versions or try different configurations of a web server package in different jails. And since the jail is limited to a narrow scope, the effects of a misconfiguration or mistake (even if done by the in- jail superuser) does not jeopardize the rest of the system's integrity. Since nothing has actually been modified outside of the jail, \\"changes\\" can be discarded by deleting the jail's copy of the directory tree. Virtualization is valuable to service providers wishing to offer their users the ability to have custom configurations and yet keep the overall system easy to maintain. For example, two different customers could need different versions of the same software. Without jails, configuring multiple software versions in different directories and ensuring they do not encroach on each other isn't always possible or easy to maintain (e.g. XFree86 is notoriously hard to move around). Jails on the other hand permit software packages to view the system egoistically, as if each package had the machine to itself. Jails can also have their own, independent, jailed superusers. The FreeBSD jail does not however achieve true virtualization; it does not allow the virtual machines to run different kernel versions than that of the base system. All virtual servers share the same kernel and hence expose the same bugs and potential security holes. There is no support for clustering or process migration, so the host kernel and host computer is still a single point of failure for all virtual servers. It is possible to use jails to safely test new software, but not new kernels. =Security= FreeBSD jails are an effective way to increase the security of a server because of the separation between the jailed environment and the rest of the system (the other jails and the base system). For example, in a non-jailed system, a web server running as user that introduces a PHP-include vulnerability would compromise the entire system: the attacker would have the rights of the user which can typically modify files on the web server, wander about in the directory tree and gather information, such as the full user list, shell and home directory from . But if the web server is jailed, the scope of user is limited to the jail, which in turn can be minimalistic enough not to give away very much. Even if the attacker gained access to the jail's superuser account, they could only modify that jail, and not the whole system. FreeBSD jails are limited in the following ways: * Jailed processes cannot interact with processes in a different jail, or on the main host. For example, the command will only show the processes running in the jail. * Modifying the running kernel by direct access and loading modules is prohibited. Modifying most sysctls and the securelevel is prohibited. * Modifying the network configuration, including interfaces, interface or IP addresses, and the routing table, is prohibited. Accessing divert and routing sockets are also prohibited. Additionally, raw sockets are disabled by default. A jail is bound only to specific IP addresses and firewall rules cannot be changed. With the introduction of VNET(virtual network stack), the jails are free to modify their Network Configuration (including interfaces, IP addresses, etc.), provided the vnet is enabled for the jail. * Mounting and unmounting filesystems is prohibited. Jails cannot access files above their root directory (i.e. a jail is chroot'ed). * Jailed processes cannot create device nodes.

Universal Methods of Design, Beverly, MA: Rockport Publishers. p204  Concept  The phrase Wizard of Oz (originally OZ Paradigm) has come into common usage in the fields of experimental psychology, human factors, ergonomics, linguistics, and usability engineering to describe a testing or iterative design methodology wherein an experimenter (the “wizard”), in a laboratory setting, simulates the behavior of a theoretical intelligent computer application (often by going into another room and intercepting all communications between participant and system). Sometimes this is done with the participant's prior knowledge and sometimes it is a low-level deceit employed to manage the participant's expectations and encourage natural behaviors. For example, a test participant may think he or she is communicating with a computer using a speech interface, when the participant's words are actually being secretly entered into the computer by a person in another room (the “wizard”) and processed as a text stream, rather than as an audio stream. The missing system functionality that the wizard provides may be implemented in later versions of the system (or may even be speculative capabilities that current-day systems do not have), but its precise details are generally considered irrelevant to the study. In testing situations, the goal of such experiments may be to observe the use and effectiveness of a proposed user interface by the test participants, rather than to measure the quality of an entire system.  Origin  John F. (“Jeff”) Kelley coined the phrases “Wizard of OZ” and “OZ Paradigm” for this purpose circa 1980 to describe the method he developed during his dissertation work at Johns Hopkins University. (His dissertation advisor was the late professor Alphonse Chapanis, the “Godfather of Human Factors and Engineering Psychology”.) Amusingly enough, in addition to some one-way mirrors and such, there literally was a blackout curtain separating Jeff, as the “Wizard”, from view by the participant during the study. The “Experimenter-in-the-Loop” technique had been pioneered at Chapanis’ Communications Research Lab at Johns Hopkins as early as 1975 (J. F. Kelley arrived in 1978). W. Randolph Ford used the experimenter-in-the-loop technique with his innovative CHECKBOOK program wherein he obtained language samples in a naturalistic setting. In Ford's method, a preliminary version of the natural language processing system would be placed in front of the user. When the user entered a syntax that was not recognized, they would receive a “Could you rephrase that?” prompt from the software. After the session, the algorithms for processing the newly obtained samples would be created or enhanced and another session would take place. This approach led to the eventual development of his natural language processing technique, \\"Multi-Stage Pattern Reduction\\". Dr. Ford's recollection was that Dr. Kelley did in fact coin the phrase \\"Wizard of Oz Paradigm\\" but that the technique had been employed in at least two separate studies before Dr. Kelley had started conducting studies at the Johns Hopkins Telecommunications Lab. A similar early use of the technique to model a Natural Language Understanding system being developed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center was done by Allen Munro and Don Norman around 1975 at the University of California, San Diego. Again, the name \\"Wizard of Oz\\" had not yet been applied to this technique. The results were published in a 1977 paper by the team (Bobrow, et al.). In that employment the experimenter (the “Wizard”) sat at a terminal in an adjacent room separated by a one-way mirror so the subject could be observed. Every input from the user was processed correctly by a combination of software processing and real-time experimenter intervention. As the process was repeated in subsequent sessions, more and more software components were added so that the experimenter had less and less to do during each session until asymptote was reached on phrase/word dictionary growth and the experimenter could “go get a cup of coffee” during the session (which at this point was a cross-validation of the final system's unattended performance). A final point: Dr. Kelley's recollection of the coinage of the term is backed up by that of the late professor Al Chapanis. In their 1985 University of Michigan technical report, Green and Wei-Haas state the following: The first appearance of the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" name in print was in Jeff Kelley's thesis (Kelley, 1983a, 1983b, 1984a). It is thought the name was coined in response to a question at a graduate seminar at Hopkins (Chapanis, 1984; Kelley, 1984b). \\"What happens if the subject sees the experimenter [behind the \\"curtain\\" in an adjacent room acting as the computer]?\\" Kelley answered: \\"Well, that's just like what happened to Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz.\\" And so the name stuck. (Cited by permission.) There is also a passing reference to planned use of the \\"Wizard of Oz experiments\\" in a 1982 proceedings paper by Ford and Smith. One fact, presented in Kelley's dissertation, about the etymology of the term in this context: Dr. Kelley did originally have a definition for the “OZ” acronym (aside from the obvious parallels with the 1900 book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L Frank Baum). “Offline Zero” was a reference to the fact that an experimenter (the “Wizard”) was interpreting the users’ inputs in real time during the simulation phase. Similar experimental setups had occasionally been used earlier, but without the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" name. Design researcher Nigel Cross conducted studies in the 1960s with \\"simulated\\" computer-aided design systems where the purported simulator was actually a human operator, using text and graphical communication via CCTV. As he explained, \\"All that the user perceives of the system is this remote-access console, and the remainder is a black box to him. ... one may as well fill the black box with people as with machinery. Doing so provides a comparatively cheap simulator, with the remarkable advantages of the human operator's flexibility, memory, and intelligence, and which can be reprogrammed to give a wide range of computer roles merely by changing the rules of operation. It sometimes lacks the real computer's speed and accuracy, but a team of experts working simultaneously can compensate to a sufficient degree to provide an acceptable simulation.\\" Cross later referred to this as a kind of Reverse Turing test.Cross, N (2001) \\"Can a Machine Design?\\", Design Issues, Vol. 17, No.41, pp. 44-50.  Significance  The Wizard of OZ method is very powerful. In its original application, Dr. Kelley was able to create a simple keyboard-input natural language recognition system that far exceeded the recognition rates of any of the far more complex systems of the day. The thinking current among many computer scientists and linguists at the time was that, in order for a computer to be able to “understand” natural language enough to be able to assist in useful tasks, the software would have to be attached to a formidable “dictionary” having a large number of categories for each word. The categories would enable a very complex parsing algorithm to unravel the ambiguities inherent in naturally produced language. The daunting task of creating such a dictionary led many to believe that computers simply would never truly “understand” language until they could be “raised” and “experience life” as humans, since humans seem to apply a life's worth of experiences to the interpretation of language. The key enabling factor for the first use of the OZ method was that the system was designed to work in a single context (calendar-keeping), which constrained the complexity of language encountered from users to the extent where a simple language processing model was sufficient to meet the goals of the application. The processing model was a two-pass keyword/keyphrase matching approach, based loosely on the algorithms employed in Weizenbaum's famous Eliza program. By inducing participants to generate language samples in the context of solving an actual task (using a computer that they believed actually understood what they were typing), the variety and complexity of the lexical structures gathered was greatly reduced and simple keyword matching algorithms could be developed to address the actual language collected. This first use of OZ was in the context of an iterative design approach. In the early development sessions, the experimenter simulated the system in toto, performing all the database queries and composing all the responses to the participants by hand. As the process matured, the experimenter was able to replace human interventions, piece by piece, with newly created developed code (which, at each phase, was designed to accurately process all the inputs that were generated in preceding steps). By the end of the process, the experimenter was able to observe the sessions in a “hands-off” mode (and measure the recognition rates of the completed program). OZ was important because it addressed the obvious criticism: :Who can afford to use an iterative method to build a separate natural language system (dictionaries, syntax) for each new context? Wouldn’t you be forever adding new structures and algorithms to handle each new batch of inputs? The answer turned out to be: By using an empirical approach like OZ, anyone can afford to do this; Dr. Kelley’s dictionary and syntax growth reached asymptote (achieving from 86% to 97% recognition rates, depending on the measurements employed) after only 16 experimental trials and the resulting program, with dictionaries, was less than 300k of code. In the 23 years that followed initial publication, the OZ method has been employed in a wide variety of settings, notably in the prototyping and usability testing of proposed user interface designs in advance of having actual application software in place.  Fictional references  The name of the experiment comes from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz story, in which an ordinary man hides behind a curtain and pretends, through the use of \\"amplifying\\" technology, to be a powerful wizard. In David Lodge's novel Small World, a university lecturer in English literature is introduced to a computer program named ELIZA, which he believes is capable of conducting a coherent conversation with him. It transpires that a computer lecturer is operating the computer and providing all the responses. The original ELIZA program, providing basic but often surprisingly human-like responses to questions, was written at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum in the 1960s.

(1489–1531) was a Franciscan friar born in Écija, Spain. Aguilar was later involved with the 1519 Spanish conquest of Mexico, and with La Malinche he assisted Hernán Cortés in translating the indigenous language to Spanish. Life and career Aguilar wound up at the colony of Santa María la Antigua del Darién, founded in Panama in 1510. Due to ongoing disputes and divisions among the leaders of the colony, in 1511 Aguilar left Panama on a caravel sailing to Santo Domingo. He took with him legal documents for a case against the other faction of the colony, as well as a large sum of gold for the proceedings. The ship sailed with a complement of sixteen men and two women. They were shipwrecked near the Yucatán Peninsula due to hitting a sand bar. The crew and passengers got into a small boat, hoping to reach Cuba or Jamaica, but strong currents brought them in their ship's boat to the coast of the modern-day Mexican state of Quintana Roo. Aguilar and 11-12 other survivorsDiego de Landa (1937). Yucatan Before and After the Conquest. sacred- texts.com. were captured by the local Maya and scheduled to be sacrificed to Maya gods. Valdivia and four others met this fate. Others died of disease and, in the case of the women, overworked as slaves. Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero (a sailor from Palos de la Frontera in Spain) managed to escape, later to be taken as slaves by another Mayan chief named Xamanzana who was hostile to the first tribe.Hugh Thomas (1993). Conquest. New York, NY: Simon & Schuster Paperbacks. Here he and Guerrero were able to learn the language of their captors. Aguilar lived as a slave during his eight years with the Maya. His continued fidelity to his religious vows led him to refuse the offers of women made to him by the chief. Guerrero became a war chief for Nachan Kaan, Lord of Chektumal, married a rich Maya woman and fathered the first mestizo children of Mexico. Hernán Cortés invaded Mexico in 1519. He heard word of there being bearded men among a neighboring tribe. Suspecting that they were fellow Spaniards, he sent word to them. Eventually Aguilar reached them and joined the expedition.Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, He demonstrated his fidelity to his faith by correctly identifying the day of week, from a steadfast following of his breviary, which he had been able to keep through all the years of his captivity. Speaking both Maya and Spanish, he, and La Malinche, who could speak Maya and Nahuatl, translated for Cortés during the Conquest of Mexico. His usefulness in that capacity ended once La Malinche had learned Spanish and was able to translate directly from Nahuatl. At this point, La Malinche became the primary interpreter for Hernán Cortés. Aguilar died in 1531 in an unknown location. His house in Mexico City later became the home of the first printing press to operate in the New World.

History In December 1977, Conrail was set to abandon of their ex-New York Central Railroad trackage between Kankakee and Sheldon, Illinois, when instead it was purchased by Beaverville businessman Fey Orr to service his lumber and agricultural products industry based there. Eighty miles of the bankrupt Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad's trackage from just north of Donovan and Danville were purchased in 1981. These two lines cross near Iroquois. The Norfolk Southern abandoned its ex-New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad trackage between Cheneyville, Illinois (north of Danville) Boswell, Indiana and Lafayette, Indiana, which KBSR purchased in 1991. Several other abandonments occurred in the area by Class I railroads which the Kankakee, Beaverville were able to capitalize on. Currently, the KBSR operates about of trackage in a vaguely triangular shape between Kankakee, Danville, and Lafayette, with numerous sidings. On July 16, 1997, company founder Fey Orr died at 85.

Smith. Although the ice cream was made in the U.S., it used a quasi-Swedish name. Frusen glädje, without the acute accent, is Swedish for \\"frozen delight\\". However the acute accent changes the word into a nonsensical word in Swedish, or at least a strange/dialectal intonation. After being sold several times, the brand is no longer being used. History Frusen Glädjé was produced at a Dairy Lea plant with special equipment and sold in 10 states in 1981, including New York and California. Frusen Glädjé was available in eight flavors (15 in the New York shop). Frusen Glädjé was distributed in every state by the end of 1982, reaching an annual production of 30 million pints, up from 18 million in 1981. Erhard Sommer was the company president. Marketing materials stated, \\"The ice cream that appeals to the sybaritic buyer with a taste for the very finest.\\" Television commercials typically featured the catch phrase, \\"I ate all the Frusen Glädjé.\\" Another catchphrase used was \\"Enjoy the Guilt\\", which appeared in print advertising and also on small crystal ice cream bowls, which were available via mail order from the company. =Conflict with Häagen-Dazs= Another American ice cream producer, Häagen-Dazs, sued unsuccessfully in 1980 to stop Frusen Glädjé from using a \\"Scandinavian marketing theme\\", despite \\"Häagen-Dazs\\" not being Scandinavian-sounding itself. Häagen-Dazs's complaints included Frusen Glädjé's \\"prominently displayed list of the product's natural ingredients, a list of artificial ingredients not found in the ice cream, directions for serving and eating the ice cream (essentially that it was best served soft), and a map of Scandinavia\\". The court ruled against Häagen-Dazs on the grounds of unclean hands, as Häagen-Dazs had similarly marketed itself as Scandinavian (specifically Danish) without having any real connection to the region. =Acquisition by Kraft Foods= In 1985, Smith sold Frusen Glädjé to Kraft General Foods. A Kraft spokeswoman states that Kraft sold its Frusen Glädjé license to the Unilever corporation in 1993. A spokesman for Unilever claims that Frusen Glädjé was not part of the deal.

In the stories, if someone did something to harm Cain, the damage would come back sevenfold. Some interpretations view this as a physical mark, whereas other interpretations see the \\"mark\\" as a sign, and not as a physical mark on Cain himself. The King James Version of the Bible reads \\"set a mark upon Cain.\\"  Origins  There is no clear consensus as to what Cain's mark was. The word translated as \\"mark\\" in Genesis 4:15 is (’ōṯ), which could mean a sign, omen, warning, remembrance, motion, gesture, agreement, miracle, wonder, or, most commonly, a letter. In the Torah, the same word is used to describe the stars as signs or omens (Genesis 1:14), the rainbow as the sign of God's promise to never again destroy his creation with a flood (Genesis 9:12), circumcision as a token of God's covenant with Abraham (Genesis 17:11), and the miracles performed by Moses before the Pharaoh (Exodus 4:8,9,17,28; 7:3; 8:23; 10:1,2).  Curse of Cain  Glasgow Botanic Gardens. Kibble Palace. Edwin Roscoe Mullins – Cain or My Punishment is Greater than I can Bear (Genesis 4:13), about 1899. The narrative of the curse of Cain is found in the text of . The curse was the result of Cain murdering his brother, Abel, and lying about the murder to God. When Cain spilled his brother's blood, the earth became cursed as soon as the blood hit the ground. In a sense, the earth was left \\"drinking Abel's blood\\".: gives a two-part sentencing for Cain's curse. The first concerns the earth that was cursed by Abel's blood.: Kugel, 163 Should Cain attempt to farm the land, the earth would not yield produce for him. This may imply why he went on to build cities,: Wenham, 108 namely the City of Enoch. The second part of the curse marks Cain as a fugitive ( ) and a wanderer ( ). The combination making up this Hebrew phrase , \\"fugitive and wanderer\\", is unique in the Hebrew Bible. Modern interpretations of the Hebrew verse 12 suggest that Cain went on to live a nomadic lifestyle and that he was also excluded from the family unit. In the Septuagint, the emphasis on Cain's curse is dramatically increased by the combination of the Greek participles στένων καὶ τρέμων (\\"groaning and shaking upon the earth\\").: Brayford, 254 Syriac Christianity interprets the Greek version to mean that Cain experienced a real physical affliction: See footnote 14 that would enable others to know who he was when they saw him. Philo interprets the Greek verse 12 as an allegory for Cain's fear of being soulless. The Samaritan Pentateuch and the Targums translate the same verse to mean that Cain feared being \\"an exile and an unstable man\\". Mark of Cain The Hebrew word for mark ('Oth, ) could mean a sign, an omen, a warning, or a remembrance. The mark of Cain is God's promise to offer Cain divine protection from premature death with the stated purpose of preventing anyone from killing him. It is not known what the mark was, but it is assumed that the mark was visible.: Mellinkoff, 1942, p.210; Moberley, 2007, p.11-28 Some have speculated that the mark was a Hebrew letter placed on either the face or the arm.: (Tg. Ps.-J. Gen 4:15, Pirqe R. El. 21) The Septuagint translates the mark as a \\"sign\\". Thus, it is speculated that the mark served as a sign to others not to commit the same offense.: Gen. Rab. 22:12 = Judaism= Abba Arika (\\"Rav\\") said that God gave Cain a dog, making him an example to murderers. Abba Jose ben Hanan said that God made a horn grow out of Cain. R. Hanin said that God made Cain an example to penitents (Gen. Rab. 22:12). Rashi comments on Genesis 4:15 by saying that the mark was one of the Hebrew letters of the Tetragrammaton: \\"He engraved a letter of His [God's] Name onto his [Cain's] forehead.\\" In Kabbalah, the Zohar states that the mark of Cain was one of the twenty-two Hebrew letters of the Torah, although the Zohar's native Aramaic does not actually tell us which of the letters it was. Some commentators, such as Rabbi Michael Berg in his English commentary on the Zohar, suggest that the mark of Cain was the letter vav.] =Christianity= According to author Ruth Mellinkoff, commentators' interpretations of the nature of the \\"mark\\" depended on their views regarding the status of Cain, as either being given additional time to repent or as being further shamed. In Syriac Christianity, early exegesis on the \\"curse\\" and the \\"mark\\", associated the curse of Cain with black skin, although not in a racial sense. In an Eastern Christian (Armenian) Adam-book (5th or 6th century), it is written: \\"And the Lord was wroth with Cain. . . He beat Cain's face with hail, which blackened like coal, and thus he remained with a black face\\".The History of Abel and Cain, 10, in Lipscomb, The Armenian Apocryphal Adam Literature, pp. 145, 250 (text) and 160, 271 (translation) Again, this indicated that his face, not his body, had been changed, and that this change had no bearing on any racial or ethnic group. = American Protestant racial beliefs on the Mark of Cain= At some point after the start of the slave trade in the United States, many Protestant denominations began teaching the belief that the mark of Cain was a dark skin tone, although early descriptions of Romani as \\"descendants of Cain\\" written by Franciscan friar Symon Semeonis suggest that this belief had existed for some time. Protestant preachers wrote exegetical analyses of the curse, with the assumption that it was dark skin.Priest, Josiah Slavery as it Relates to the Negro or African Race (1843) Baptist segregation The split between the Northern and Southern Baptist organizations arose over doctrinal issues pertaining to slavery and the education of slaves. At the time of the split, the Southern Baptist group used the curse of Cain as a justification for slavery. Some 19th- and 20th- century Baptist ministers in the Southern United States taught the belief that there were two separate heavens; one for blacks, and one for whites. Southern Baptists have either taught or practiced various forms of racial segregation well into the mid-to-late-20th century, though members of all races were accepted at worship services. In 1995, the Southern Baptist Convention officially denounced racism and apologized for its past defense of slavery. The curse of Cain was used to support a ban on ordaining blacks to most Protestant clergies until the 1960s in both the United States and Europe. The majority of Christian churches in the world, including the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox churches, Anglican churches, and Oriental Orthodox churches, did not recognize these interpretations and did not participate in the religious movement to support them. Certain Catholic dioceses in the Southern United States adopted a policy of not ordaining blacks to oversee, administer the sacraments to, or accept confessions from white parishioners. This policy was not based on a \\"curse of Cain\\" teaching, but was justified by the widely held perception that slaves should not rule over their masters. However, this was not approved of by the Pope or by any papal teaching.Dictionary of Afro- American Slavery. Curse of Ham The Curse of Cain was often conflated with the Curse of Ham. According to the Bible, Ham discovered his father Noah drunk and naked in his tent, but instead of honoring his father by covering his nakedness, he ran and told his brothers about it. Because of this, Noah cursed Ham's son, Canaan by saying that he was to be \\"a servant of servants\\". () One interpretation of this passage states that Ham married a descendant of Cain. While there is no indication in the Bible of Ham's wife descending from Cain, this interpretation was used to justify slavery and it was particularly popular in North America during the Atlantic slave trade.Benjamin Braude, \\"The Sons of Noah and the Construction of Ethnic and Geographical Identities in the Medieval and Early Modern Periods, \\"William and Mary Quarterly LIV (January 1997): 103–42. See also William McKee Evans, \\"From the Land of Canaan to the Land of Guinea: The Strange Odyssey of the Sons of Ham,\\"American Historical Review 85 (February 1980): 15–43John N. Swift and Gigen Mammoser, \\"'Out of the Realm of Superstition: Chesnutt's 'Dave's Neckliss' and the Curse of Ham'\\", American Literary Realism, vol. 42 no. 1, Fall 2009, 3 Modern scholars now believe that the Canaanites are of Semitic origin, and therefore unrelated to black Africans. Latter-day Saints Mormonism began during the height of Protestant acceptance of the curse of Cain doctrine in North America, as well as the even more popular curse of Ham doctrine. Like many North Americans, Mormons of the 19th century commonly assumed that black Africans had Cain's \\"mark\\" of black skin,. Reprint by Utah Lighthouse Ministry and Ham's curse to be servants of servants. Joseph Smith indicated his belief in the curse of Ham theory in a parenthetical reference as early as 1831.Manuscript History 19 June 1831 In the Pearl of Great Price, considered scripture in the LDS movement, Enoch talks about shunning the descendants of Cain and that they had black skin: \\"And Enoch also beheld the residue of the people which were the sons of Adam; and they were a mixture of all the seed of Adam save it was the seed of Cain, for the seed of Cain were black, and had not place among them.\\" () As related by Abraham O. Smoot after his death, Apostle David W. Patten said he encountered a black man in Paris, Tennessee, who said that he was Cain. The account states that Cain had earnestly sought death but was denied it, and that his mission was to destroy the souls of men. The recollection of Patten's story is quoted in Apostle Spencer W. Kimball's The Miracle of Forgiveness. Although not explicitly stated in Latter-day Saint scripture current official publications of the church teach that Ham's wife was a descendant of Cain. The Guide to the Scriptures, published as an explanatory companion to the scriptures, states \\"Ham’s wife, Egyptus, was a descendant of Cain\\". The Old Testament student manual, which is published by the Church and is the manual currently used to teach the Old Testament in LDS Institutes, states: =Priesthood ban= There is evidence that Joseph Smith did not consider the ban on black men to the priesthood to be relevant in modern times, since he himself (and other church leaders close to him) ordained black men into it, notably Elijah Abel and Walker Lewis. After the death of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young (the second President of the Church) accepted the idea that people of African ancestry were generally under the curse of Cain, and in 1852, he stated that people of black African descent were not eligible to hold the church's priesthood.Wilford Woodruff, Diary of Wilford Woodruff, January 16, 1852. \\"[A]ny man having one drop of the seed of [Cain] … in him cannot hold the priesthood and if no other Prophet ever spake it before I will say it now in the name of Jesus Christ\\". Young taught that in the war in heaven, both Cain and Abel were leaders. The spirits of black people fought under Cain and were assigned to be Cain's descendants. Those that fought under Abel were assigned to be Abel's descendants. Cain hoped that by killing his brother, the spirits that were under him would have an advantage over the spirits under Abel. However, God cursed Cain and his descendants to not have the priesthood until all of Abel's descendants had the priesthood. The spirits of black people understood this and stood with Cain and accepted the punishment. The ban on the priesthood affected black members differently than it did in other churches because the LDS Church has a lay priesthood in which virtually all worthy male members become priesthood holders. Several of Young's successors defended the priesthood ban as being a result of the curse of Cain, though some disagreed. Sterling M. McMurrin reported that, in 1954, church president David O. McKay said: \\"There is not now, and there never has been a doctrine in this church that the negroes are under a divine curse. There is no doctrine in the church of any kind pertaining to the negro. We believe that we have a scriptural precedent for withholding the priesthood from the negro. It is a practice, not a doctrine, and the practice someday will be changed. And that's all there is to it.\\"Sterling M. McMurrin affidavit, March 6, 1979. See David O. McKay and the Rise of Modern Mormonism by Greg Prince and William Robert Wright, p.. Quoted by Genesis Group In 1978, LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball reported receiving a revelation from God allowing all worthy male members of the church to receive the priesthood without regard to race or color. (LDS standard works); see also: Official Declaration 2 Although the church had previously been criticized for its policy during the civil rights movement, the change seems to have been prompted by problems facing mixed-race converts in Brazil. There has neither been an official or an explicit church repudiation of its policy, nor has there been an admission that it was a mistake. Many black church members think that giving an apology would be a \\"detriment\\" to church work and a catalyst for further racial misunderstanding. African-American church member Bryan E. Powell says: \\"There is no pleasure in old news, and this news is old.\\" Gladys Newkirk agrees, stating: \\"I've never experienced any problems in this church. I don't need an apology .... We're the result of an apology.\\" Many black Mormons say that they are willing to look beyond the former teachings and cleave to the doctrines of the church, in part because of its powerful, detailed teachings on life after death. The LDS Church has issued an official statement about past practices and theories regarding skin color, stating: \\"[t]oday, the Church disavows the theories advanced in the past that black skin is a sign of divine disfavor or curse, ... Church leaders today unequivocally condemn all racism, past and present, in any form.\\" =Civil rights= When Utah was considering slavery, Brigham Young told the Utah Territorial Legislature that the curse of Cain required slavery. He argued that until all of the descendants of Abel have access to the priesthood, all of the descendants of Cain should remain in servitude. He argued that because they did not have the right to govern the affairs of the Church due to the priesthood ban, they also shouldn't have the right to govern the affairs of the state, including the right to vote. He warned that if they made the children of Cain equal to them, they would be cursed. He also argued that if someone married a descendant of Cain, that they would also have the same curse. The church has since repudiated all of these teachings.

Plot At a grocery store where a cardboard box of six free puppies, five black labs and a Labrador retriever. Children come by and the black labs are adopted are taken to a home. Only the Labrador retriever puppy is left in the box and on that raining night he escapes to the streets. A year later, that puppy is eluding animal control. Eventually he is caught and taken to the pound. Calvin Wheeler (Kyle Massey) is a popular boy at school who collects comic books in his spare time. Calvin's best friend is Raymond Figg (Mitchel Musso), who prefers to be called Figg. He saved Figg's life in the second grade when Figg had an asthma attack, and Figg, very devoted, manages his schedule and occasionally does his homework. Gotham Man is the name of Calvin's favorite comic. His collection is almost complete, except for one issue that is ever-so-rare, the first one, which is worth $3,000. When a show-dog runs after Calvin while skateboarding, he finds out that when one wins a dog show, they earn major cash. The cash prize is $5,000, which Calvin needs to buy the first issue of Gotham Man. Calvin goes to the dog rescue shelter and adopts the Labrador retriever, whom he named Tyco. A girl volunteer at the run down animal shelter, Emily Watson (Kay Panabaker), believes that this has to be another one of the crazy schemes or plans that Calvin has in mind. So she interviews Calvin and judges him a good owner for Tyco, and she says yes when Calvin asks her to the upcoming school dance, until she realizes that he's entering Tyco in a dog show. But there is someone else who wants to make sure Calvin and Tyco lose - Preston Price (Carter Jenkins), a stuck-up rich boy who has won two of the past dog shows with his dog, Jaques. When Calvin and Tyco perform great at the qualifiers, Preston is jealous, so he hires people to beat Calvin up, and later to pretend that they are Tyco's real family, but when the three main characters realize that this is not Tyco's family, Figg and Calvin come up with a plan. He convinces Figg to pretend he is selling magazines and to fake an asthma attack. When this happens, Calvin runs into the basement and rescues Tyco while Figg is still acting. Emily forgives Calvin. This is the day of the dog show and they decide to go. Calvin's dad (Mark Christopher Lawrence) drives them there. They are not prepared, so they come up with a last minute routine of Tyco pulling Calvin on his skateboard. Preston scores a 98, but is worried that Calvin will win, so Preston cheats by rigging a ramp so Calvin will lose. However, Preston is caught and disqualified. Still, Calvin and Tyco win with a 99. Using his prize money, Calvin donates to the shelter so that the dogs can have better homes. In the end, the shelter is saved and Figg, along with many other people, adopts a new pet.

The residents of Merihaka tend to value highly the scenery, central location, tranquil atmosphere and lack of cars. The housing complex was built, partly on reclaimed land, during the 1970s and 1980s, and today it is home to some 2,300 people. A distinctive feature, shared with some other places in Helsinki such as Itä-Pasila, is traffic segregation: the streets for cars and buses together with large car parks are on a level of their own, below that of pedestrian footways and the main entrances to the buildings. This arrangement was to increase the cosiness of the area as well as improve traffic safety. The area has a central location, only about from the core of downtown Helsinki. Some flats with sea views command very high prices. The attractiveness of Merihaka is increased by its small-boat harbour and many residents are members of the local yacht club. Public transportation possibilities are diverse and rapid. Former residents Merihaka include the former prime minister of Finland, Kalevi Sorsa.

It lies on the Cross-City Line from Redditch and Bromsgrove through Birmingham New Street to Lichfield. The station's main entrance is located on Pershore Road South, the A441. History Kings Norton station in 1967 The current Kings Norton station is the second station to be built in the Kings Norton area. The original Lifford railway station (the first of three stations to bear the Lifford name) was first built on what is now the Camp Hill Line. Opening in 1849, Kings Norton was developed as part of the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway's line to Curzon Street via the Camp Hill Line. In 1852 the stationmaster, Thomas Clark, was fined 50s () for causing a collision. He allowed a goods-train on the line when an express train was due, and used defective signal lamps. The express train collided with the goods train and there was substantial damage, but no loss of life. On 19 March 1864 at 6:00 pm, a luggage train with several trucks of sheep suffered a failed axle and all of the trucks behind were thrown off the line. Two of the trucks containing sheep descended the embankment and overturned, killing many of the sheep instantly. A fast train from Bristol was halted before it reached the collision site. The platforms were extended in length in 1892 with the extension of the Midland Railway's Birmingham West Suburban Railway. This enabled the construction of a large coal and goods yard with sidings for the adjacent Triplex factory. In the mid 1920s, two additional lines and platforms were added - opening to traffic on 14 March 1926. Stations on the Camp Hill Line were closed to Passenger Traffic from January 1941, although passenger trains continued to use the line and stop at Kings Norton Station. The station was rebuilt in 1978 by British Rail and the lines through the station were electrified in 1993. =Station masters= *Thomas Clark. ca. 1852 *Thomas Plumb 1870–1891 *Levi Lovell 1892–1900 *Aaron Walker 1900–1902 *Alfred Smith 1902–1914 – ???? *Frederick James Stallard 1920 – 1925 (formerly station master at Brightside and Wincobank, afterwards station master at Evesham) *A.

(formerly station master at Newcastle-under-Lyme) *Leslie Jones ???? – 1965 From 1965 the position of station master was abolished. Today With the development of both bus and tram services, the need for such a large facility reduced from the 1930s onwards. The result is that today although all four platforms remain in place, only the outer two are in passenger use, with the middle island platforms now derelict. Refurbished as part of the Cross-City line in 1978, it retained some of its original features following refurbishment, unlike the other 'cross city line' stations. The original station building survived, leased out for commercial purposes, until it was demolished in February 2006 for safety reasons. An extension car park provides a Park and Ride facility. Kings Norton is served by West Midlands Trains services, using Class 323 electric multiple units. West Midlands Trains operate the Cross-City line on behalf of Transport for West Midlands. Kings Norton Station is equipped with real-time information departure boards which were installed in 2006 by Central Trains. Disabled access There is step-free access to platform 1 (for trains towards ) from the ticket office entrance. Step-free access to platform 4 (for trains towards ) is via the Pershore Road South road bridge and the car park. Services Trains call here every 10 minutes in each direction Monday to Saturday daytimes and every 15 minutes in the evenings and on Sundays. Since July 2018, southbound trains serve as well as Redditch (every 20 minutes weekday daytimes, half-hourly evenings and Sundays). Future The island platforms at Kings Norton are disused, but could potentially be brought back into service. Kings Norton Station could see refurbishment of the island platform for passenger use, should the proposal to reopen the Camp Hill Line progress. This could see the introduction of 3 (possibly 4) trains per hour between Kings Norton and . Only the two outer railway lines at Kings Norton are electrified fully (platform 3 is electrified but as a terminal point only), however the type of cantilever used on the platform means the lines can quite easily be fully electrified should the Camp Hill Line reopen for passenger traffic, though the track layout will need amending. In the media Kings Norton Station has been used, along with many other areas of Birmingham, as a location in the BBC daily serial Doctors (for example in an episode first broadcast on 9 November 2011).

He would lose the title two months later to SUWA, and in that match, he suffered a bad knee injury that put him out of action for the remainder of the year. He would return to action on the first show of 2000 and proceeded to feud with SUWA. Though he failed to win the NWA World Welterweight Title back from SUWA, he did defeat him in a Mask vs. Hair match on August 24. Shortly after winning, he was attacked by a debuting Darkness Dragon, and they started a feud that would last for a little over two years. It ended on September 8, 2002, when he defeated Darkness Dragon in a Best of Three Falls Mask vs. Mask Match, forcing Darkness to unmask. Darkness Dragon was booted out of M2K following the loss. He announced the formation of a new stable dubbed Do FIXER, and he invited Kid and Ryo Saito to join him, and they both accepted. On October 28, after Magnum TOKYO dissolved M2K, he announced that he and the remnants of M2K were the real Do FIXER, and that Darkness Dragon - now renamed K-ness - was still a member of the group and was sent into the home army (Seikigun) to cause problems within it. It worked in that Ryo Saito was not welcomed back into Seikigun, but Dragon Kid, however, was. When Seikigun disbanded at the end of 2002, he joined Masaaki Mochizuki's Shin M2K stable at the start of 2003. He stayed with the group until it dissolved in December, after Mochizuki lost a match to stablemate Kenichiro Arai. After that, Kid would go unaligned until mid-2004, and in May he won that year's El Numero Uno Tournament to the surprise of everyone. In mid-2004, he became a member of Do FIXER, and would stay in it until the very end. During his tenure with them, he won the Open the Brave Gate Championship from inaugural champion Naruki Doi in November 2005, and would hold the Open the Triangle Gate Titles with Ryo Saito and Genki Horiguchi on three separate occasions in 2005 and 2006. During the last few months of 2006, he contracted appendicitis, forcing him out of action for several months. 2007 he won his first non-Japanese promotion's championship, wXw's Lightweight Championship, in Essen, Germany after defeating the British wrestler PAC.Cagematch : Dragon Kid > Title When Dragon Kid returned in early 2007, Saito decided to end Do FIXER activity following the betrayal of Genki Horiguchi, and brought him along into CIMA's new Typhoon stable. He joined them with a new look, marking the first ever change of his ring attire. When Saito and Susumu Yokosuka started teaming together, he and CIMA started teaming up exclusively with each other, calling themselves CK-1. When CIMA was out injured in mid-2008, Dragon Kid formed a team with Shingo Takagi for that year's Summer Adventure Tag League Tournament. The team proved very successful, even making it to the finals, but they lost out to the previous year's winners Naruki Doi and Masato Yoshino. On December 28, he, Ryo Saito and Susumu Yokosuka fought a Unit Split Survival Three-Way Six-Man Tag Match against teams from WORLD-1 and Real Hazard, and they lost, bringing about the end of Typhoon. However, he did not remain unaligned for very long, for on January 11, 2009, he joined Shingo Takagi's new unit, KAMIKAZE. On February 15, he, Shingo, and Taku Iwasa won the Open the Triangle Gate titles, but they lost them two months later. At the end of the year, when the Generation War was going on, the Veteran-gun extended an invite to him to join their ranks. He did not accept nor reject the invitation, which eventually caused his KAMIKAZE stablemates to question where his loyalties lied. After Akira Tozawa interrupted an Ultra Hurricanrana attempt in a six-man tag match on January 11, 2010, causing them and YAMATO to lose, Kid decided to leave KAMIKAZE and side with CIMA, Gamma Susumu Yokosuka and KAGETORA in the WARRIORS-5 group, and by default the Veteran-gun. Dragon Kid in November 2016 Dragon Kid turned heel on January 14, 2011, along with the rest of WARRIORS, when they attacked Masato Yoshino and World-1, and joined forces with Naruki Doi's group. On January 18 the new group was named Blood Warriors. On May 15, the rest of Blood Warriors turned on Dragon Kid and kicked him out of the group, despite the fact that he still held the Open the Triangle Gate Championship with CIMA and Ricochet. He then joined Masaaki Mochizuki's new stable, Junction Three, to battle his former group. As a result, the title was declared vacant. On June 19 Dragon Kid gained a measure of revenge on Blood Warriors, when he and PAC defeated Ryo Saito and Genki Horiguchi to win the Open the Twin Gate Championship. They would lose the title to Blood Warriors representatives CIMA and Ricochet on July 17. On February 9, 2012, Junction Three was forced to disband, after losing a fourteen-man elimination tag team match to Blood Warriors. After joining the Veteran-gun, Dragon Kid won the Open the Brave Gate Championship for the second time on May 6, defeating Ricochet. After a reign of 364 days and nine successful defenses, he lost the title to Masato Yoshino on May 5, 2013. He would go on to team with Oretachi Veteran-gun stablemate K-Ness to win the Open the Twin Gate Championship, and with K-Ness and Masaaki Mochizuki, won the Open the Triangle Gate Championship. He would suffer an injury later on, and would be forced to vacate both titles. On August 17, 2014, Dragon Kid and Masaaki Mochizuki quit Oretachi Veteran-gun to form a new stable with BxB Hulk, which on September 9, 2014 would be named Dia.HEARTS. On February 4, 2016, Dia.HEARTS was forced to disband after losing a match to Monster Express and VerserK. On April 7, Dragon Kid joined the Over Generation unit. On April 6, 2018, Kid defeated Kagetora to win the vacant Open the Brave Gate Championship for the third time. Music career On November 11, 2007, Dragon Gate Records (a subsidiary of Dragon Gate Wrestling) released a CD featuring music from Nakamura and Eiji Ezaki (Japanese singer and retired wrestler, also known as Hayabusa).

The fair features multiples stages with live entertainment, DJs, food vendors, community-group stalls as well as a curated artisan alley with dozens of Northern California artists. Due to community pressure the fair restructured the organization and partnered with local charities to collect gate donations and partner with groups at the beverage and beer booths to raise money for those charities. Jugglers at the fair in 1975 The Castro Street Fair was founded by Harvey Milk, and the group he led, the Castro Valley Association, in 1974. It attracted over 5,000 people. The event's popularity grew quickly and by 1977, the attendance reached 70,000. The influx of visitors helped promote the Castro district's growing tourist industry. Castro Street Fair is one of San Francisco's many street fairs, including the North Beach Festival, Union Street Festival and Haight Street Fair. These fairs run throughout the summer, from spring to fall. The Castro Street fair takes place on the afternoon of the first Sunday in October.

In addition, the Chapmans animated a music video for Y-O-U's song \\"LA Lindsay.\\" Originally from Indiana, the band relocated to Georgia in 2002. Their self-titled debut album was released in 2003. Their next LP, Flashlights, was released on compact disc in January 2007; however, as a promotional tactic, the entire album is also available as a free download via the band's MySpace profile. After a final record was released in the summer of 2009, the band announced its retirement from recording and performing their original music as Y-O-U. Y-O-U is also known for short mockumentaries available on their website, their MySpace page, and YouTube. In December 2006, Y-O-U was named one of the Top 25 Best Bands on MySpace by Rolling Stone. Venkman’s, the new restaurant/bar/music venue/entertainment concept from Nick Niespodziani, Peter Olson and chef Nick Melvin, is set to open in the Old Fourth Ward sometime in mid-September. You may not know Niespodziani and Olson by name. But if you live in Atlanta, you’ll likely recognize them as the wild-style co-front men of Yacht Rock Revue — the comedic band they modestly call “the Greatest Show on Surf and the finest tribute to ’70s light rock to ever perform anywhere.” Niespodziani and Olson also are the co-founders of PleaseRock, which books and promotes a bevy of other bands, including Yacht Rock Schooner, the Whiskey Gentry and Blair Crimmins and the Hookers.

In 2012 he was hired by Google. A 1995 article in Next Generation commented \\"It's true that of the machines that Mical and Needle have created, only the Amiga has been a true global mass market hit ... But it's only fair to put forward the argument that this is down to the marketing of the machines rather than the quality of the product.\\" Biography According to Mical he created his first electronic game, a tic-tac-toe player, when he was 14. Robert J. Mical graduated in 1979 from the University of Illinois with dual degrees in Computer Science and English, plus a minor in Philosophy.

From 1990 to 1995, Mical was one of the co-founders of New Technologies Group (NTG), a company established to create a new game system, working again with Needle and Morse. Mical co-designed the hardware and headed the creation of the system's multitasking operating system, Portfolio. The company later merged with The 3DO Company and their technology became the base of the 32-bit console 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. Mical also created a number of other systems for NTG, including a file system for medical devices. From 1996 to 2005, Mical worked on mobile and online projects. In 1996 and 1997, Mical was part of the creation of a joint company effort, joining Prolific and founding Glassworks, which developed online games.

During 1925 he explored early Olmec sites in Mexico, and later studied additional sites in Central America and the American Southwest. In addition to more than 15 scholarly works, mostly about Native Americans, he wrote several novels, including the Pulitzer Prize- winning, Laughing Boy (1929). La Farge also wrote and published short stories, in such leading magazines as The New Yorker and Esquire. His more notable works, both fiction and non-fiction, emphasize Native American culture. He was most familiar with the Navajo people, had a speaking knowledge of their language, and was nicknamed by them 'Anast'harzi Nez', i.e. \\"Tall Cliff- Dweller\\". Early life and education Oliver La Farge was born in New York City but grew up in Newport, Rhode Island. He was the son of Christopher Grant La Farge, a noted Beaux-Arts architect, and Florence Bayard Lockwood. His older brother Christopher La Farge became a writer and was a novelist. La Farge and his paternal uncle, architect Oliver H. P. La Farge, were both named for a great-great-grandfather, Oliver Hazard Perry. La Farge received both his Bachelor of Arts degree (1924) and his master's degree (1929) from Harvard University. Career La Farge worked as a writer and an anthropologist. During 1925, he traveled with the Danish archeologist Frans Blom, who taught at Tulane University, to what is now known as the Olmec heartland. He (re)discovered San Martin Pajapan Monument 1 and, more importantly, the ruins of La Venta, one of the major Olmec centers. La Farge devoted considerable study to Native American peoples and issues, especially after relocating to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1933. He became a champion for American Indian rights and was president of the Association on American Indian Affairs for several years.. During World War II, La Farge served with the U.S. Air Transport Command, ending service with the rank of major. He participated with the Battle for Greenland, commanded by Colonel Bernt Balchen. Balchen, together with Corey Ford and La Farge, wrote War Below Zero: The Battle for Greenland (1944) about the actions to defend Greenland. Marriage and family La Farge married heiress Wanden Matthews and had two children with her: a son, Oliver Albee La Farge (b. 1931, later known as Peter La Farge and a daughter, Povy. They relocated to Santa Fe during 1933, but Wanden disliked the area and they eventually divorced during 1937. Their first son, Oliver Albee, became estranged from his father and changed his name to Peter La Farge. He relocated to New York City, where he became a well-known folksinger and songwriter in Greenwich Village, performing during the 1950s and 1960s. Some of his most successful songs have Native American themes including a famous one, 'As Long As The Grass Shall Grow', which takes its name from the title of one of his father's books. La Farge married a second time, to Consuelo Otile Baca, with whom he had a son, John Pendaries \\"Pen\\" La Farge. La Farge's non-fiction book, Behind The Mountains (1956), is based on his memories of Consuelo's family, the Baca family of New Mexico who were ranchers in northern New Mexico. He wrote a regular column for the Santa Fe newspaper, The New Mexican. Some of his columns were collected and published as The Man With the Calabash Pipe (1966).

The product was first manufactured by Ralston Purina. The product's tagline is \\"Dogs Don't Know It's Not Bacon,\\" which appeared in U.S. television commercials in the 1990s. The product is manufactured to resemble bacon strips. History Beggin' Strips were first sold in 1993. Nestlé Purina started off by selling this product in North America. Nutrition A Beggin' Strips treat Purina Beggin' Strips contain some bacon and include other ingredients such as sodium nitrite and BHA as preservatives and corn gluten meal, wheat flour, ground yellow corn, water, sugar, glycerin, soybean meal, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, phosphoric acid, sorbic acid, natural and artificial smoke flavors. The product comes in a variety of flavors. Marketing The trademark bag for the product features a cartoon dog licking his chops while awaiting a treat. Drawn up in 1994, the dog was named \\"Hamlet.\\" Hamlet was chosen to appear in Nestlé Purina's advertising for Beggin' Strips, and to represent the product. Purina holds an annual pet parade around the time of Mardi Gras. The Parade, originally sponsored by Purina Beggin’ Strips, and now a general Purina event, is held every year in Soulard, a historic French neighborhood in St. Louis, Missouri with over 5,000 pets and their owners in attendance.

(SLRC) is a South Carolina non-profit public law corporation which offers legal support to defend what they see as First Amendment violations, violation of civil rights, or discrimination against advocates of southern heritage. History The SLRC was founded in 1995 by a group of four attorneys: Carl A. Barrington (deceased), Kirk David Lyons, Larry Norman, and Lourie A. Salley III. Lyons was appointed Chief Trial Counsel, a position he still holds, and Salley became the firm's first board chairman. The organization is a registered South Carolina corporation with its executive offices in Black Mountain, North Carolina. In 1996, the SLRC successfully defended the \\"Blacksburg (SC) 7\\" and in 1999 sued a Greenville, South Carolina, private academy on behalf of Dr. Winston McCuen, a teacher at the school who had been fired for refusing to remove a Confederate flag that was part of a classroom historical display, and for refusing to salute the US in protest. In 2004 the SLRC hired advertising executive and Southern activist Roger McCredie as its full-time executive director. Under McCredie the organization doubled the size of its board of directors, increased its advertising program and undertook an ambitious five-year growth and development plan.Interview with Roger McCredie November 8, 2009 SLRC advocacy The SLRC, was the first law firm to promote a legal theory developed by Lyons that combined First Amendment protection with an interpretation of the \\"National Origin\\" provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that would afford federal legal protection for what Lyons termed \\"Confederate Southern Americans.\\" Using this interpretation of Civil Rights law, the SLRC undertook cases on behalf of Federal Aviation Administration workers in Florida, utility company employees in South Carolina, workers at a DuPont plant in Virginia (the \\"DuPont Seven\\"), and Cherokee students in Alabama. Federal judges have shown almost universal hostility to legal protection for \\"Confederate Southern Americans,\\" but Lyons and the SLRC still advocate for clients claiming an increase in the number of job-related persecution of \\"Confederate Southern Americans\\" and a paucity of legal protection in the workplace save for cases that come under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Lyons has noted that \\"Republican judges are adamantly opposed to any extension of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Democratic Judges are hostile to almost all things Confederate.\\" The SLRC has supported the rights of students to use and display Confederate symbols. Its most significant victory was Castorina v. Madison County Schools, in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in 2001 overturned a federal district court's ruling in favor of a Kentucky school board's ban on student displays of Confederate symbols, and remanded the case for further proceedings.Castorina v. Madison County Schools, [1] (6th Cir. 2001). In 2006 the Castorina decision led to an out-of-court award of damages for Jacqueline Duty, an SLRC client who had sued her own school board after she was barred from attending her high school prom in a Confederate flag-patterned evening gown. Criticism The SLRC has drawn fire from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which has frequently attacked the SLRC by citing Lyons' pre- SLRC defense of some controversial right-wing figures such as Aryan Nations members, White Aryan Resistance founder Tom Metzger\\"In the Lyons Den: Kirk Lyons, a white supremacist lawyer whose clients have been a 'Who's Who' of the radical right\\".

The SPLC also criticized Lyons tie to Deborah Davila's FBI espionage case. In addition the SPLC has called Southern Legal's fundraising practices \\"deceitful\\" citing, for example, \\"the SLRC Web site detailed two disputes under a headline that read 'Cases Pending,' implying that the SLRC represented the parties involved. In both cases, the plaintiff's families say Lyons actually did very little for them.\\"\\"Cashing in on the Confederacy\\". Southern Poverty Law Center. Spring 2003. .

The film depicts the natural community of animals populating an old abandoned windmill in the country, and how they deal with a severe summer thunderstorm that nearly destroys their habitat. It incorporates the song \\"One Day When We Were Young\\" from Johann Strauss II's operetta The Gypsy Baron. The Old Mill was the first Silly Symphony cartoon to be released by RKO and was added a new Silly Symphony logo, some new titles, and a burlap background which was used for other several Disney theatrical cartoon series like Donald Duck, Goofy, Mickey Mouse, and Pluto the Pup. This Silly Symphonies cartoon was re-issued to theatres by Buena Vista Distribution. Like many of the later Silly Symphony shorts, The Old Mill was a testing ground for advanced animation techniques. Marking the first use of Disney's multiplane camera, the film also incorporates realistic depictions of animal behavior, complex lighting and color effects, depictions of wind, rain, lightning, ripples, splashes and reflections, three-dimensional rotation of detailed objects, and the use of timing to produce specific dramatic and emotional effects. All of the lessons learned from making The Old Mill would subsequently be incorporated into Disney's feature-length animated films, such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), which was released a month later, as well as Pinocchio (1940), Fantasia (1940) and Bambi (1942).Thomas, Bob. Walt Disney: An American Original. Simon & Schuster, 1976, p. 134. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Awards and accolades The Old Mill won the 1937 Academy Award for Best Short Subjects: Cartoons.

He has stated that he is an Ashanti prince. Professional wrestling career Although Nana was born in the United States and is signed to Ring Of Honor and is the Director of National Sales at www.MerchantAccountSaver.com, he states that he is the son of an Ashanti tribe member with royal heritage and the heir to the throne of Ashanti in Ghana. When Nana was three, his family relocated to Ghana for five years, returning so that Nana could be educated in America. As a teenager, he relocated to New York City in America as an exchange student. In 1992, at the age of fifteen, Nana watched WrestleMania VIII, and was inspired by the WWF Championship match between \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage and Ric Flair to become a wrestler. A year later, he wrote to the World Wrestling Federation and asked their advice as to which professional wrestling school he should attend. The WWF recommended that he train under Larry Sharpe, but Nana felt that Sharpe's school (in Westville, New Jersey) was too far away. Instead, Nana became a photographer for Johnny Rodz, who operated Gleason's Gym in New York. Nana worked for Rodz until he turned eighteen, when Rodz began training him as a wrestler. He debuted in 1996, wrestling in a church in Spanish Harlem. Nana worked regularly for the East Coast Wrestling Association in Delaware and USA Pro Wrestling in New York, as well as making appearances with the WWF and with Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX in Japan. =Ring of Honor (2002–present)= In 2002, he joined the upstart Ring of Honor promotion, where in 2004 he formed a heel stable known as The Embassy. In storylines, Nana used his wealth gained from the taxes of people of Ghana to hire wrestlers to wrestle his opponents and rivals. Under his management John Walters defended his ROH Pure Championship and Jimmy Rave, Alex Shelley and Abyss won the Trios Tournament in 2006. He remained with Ring of Honor until September 2006, when he gave his notice. Nana in 2005 On October 24, 2008, in Danbury, Connecticut, Nana made a surprise return to Ring of Honor, saying he has no more riches, no more crown, and just wants a job before he was dragged away by security. The next night, Nana made an appearance at Ring of Honor's Edison, New Jersey show and did the same thing. Again, he was dragged away by security. The next time ROH was in Edison on January 17, 2009, Nana again appeared, only to be dragged away by security. He has since been featured in segments on the ROH Video Wire. In a March edition of the ROH Video Wire, Nana revealed that he had regained his riches due to President Obama's stimulus package, and has been directing Bison Smith's attacks on ROH wrestlers. On March 20, at the ROH show in Elizabeth, PA, Nana declared that he had officially reformed the Embassy, with himself, Bison Smith and Ernie Osiris. The next day in New York City they were joined by the returning Jimmy Rave. Other members of the stable came to include Claudio Castagnoli, Joey Ryan, Erick Stevens, Shawn Daivari and Necro Butcher, but by October 2010 all of them, except Osiris, had left the group. On January 22, 2011, Nana debuted the latest version of the Embassy, consisting of Ernesto Osiris, Mia Yim, R.D. Evans, and Tommaso Ciampa, who would take over Jimmy Rave's former role as Nana's number one wrestler. The following April and June, both Dave Taylor and Rhino made appearances representing the Embassy. On the July 28 episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling, The Embassy disbanded, when Ciampa turned on Nana, after R.D. Evans had revealed his deal with Truth Martini, which had cost Ciampa the ROH World Television Championship. On Monday June 3, 2013, Nana received a tryout with WWE, Nana commented on the tryout on Facebook, writing, \\"Great day with the WWE...The future may be bright....Fools.\\" In mid-2013, Nana was given the new on-screen role of ROH Talent Scout. In late 2014, Nana formed yet another version of the Embassy with Moose, Stokely Hathaway and Veda Scott, which was later disbanded.

In the , Gin Gin had a population of 1,053 people. Geography Gin Gin is located on the Bruce Highway, approximately west of Bundaberg and north-west of Brisbane, the state capital. The town owes its existence to its strategic location about halfway between Brisbane and Rockhampton. It is often used as a stop-over point for drivers travelling between these two centres. Bundaberg Gin Gin Road (State Route 3) runs east from the Bruce Highway. History Gureng Gureng (also known as Gooreng Gooreng, Goreng Goreng, Goeng, Gurang, Goorang Goorang, Korenggoreng) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Gureng Gureng people. The Gooreng Gooreng language region includes the towns of Bundaberg, Gin Gin and Miriam Vale extending south towards Childers, inland to Monto and Mt Perry. The town name Gin Gin has sometimes been said to derive from a local Aboriginal word indicating \\"red soil thick scrub\\". British occupation of the region began in 1848 when Gregory Blaxland Jnr (son of the explorer Gregory Blaxland) together with William Forster brought their flocks of sheep up from their squatting leases on the Clarence River. The pastoral run they selected extended all the way to the coast and they called it Tirroan. The modern town of Gin Gin is located close to where the original homestead was constructed. Strong resistance from the local Aboriginal people was encountered resulting in the death of several shepherds and the killing of Blaxland in August 1850. Two large massacres of Aboriginals were conducted by local squatters and their stockmen as punitive measures to these deaths. About 1851, Arthur and Alfred Henry Brown bought Tirroan from William Forster and renamed the run Gin Gin. The Brown Brothers previously owned a pastoral property called Gin Gin in Western Australia. The run was later purchased by Sir Thomas McIlwraith, who was Premier of Queensland three times between 1879 and 1893. The Gin Gin district is nicknamed Wild Scotsman Country due to the capture of one of Queensland's few bushrangers, James Alpin McPherson, in the area on 30 March 1866. McPherson, who went by the same nickname, was captured at Monduran Station, north of town. Gin Gin Post Office opened on 15 March 1875. The town was first surveyed in 1880. Gin Gin Provisional School opened on 26 June 1882. On 3 November 1890 it became Gin Gin State School with 8 students under teacher Arthur William Moore. In 1956, the school expanded to offer secondary schooling, until a separate Gin Gin State High School was established on 1 February 1972. Gin Gin State Pre-School opened on 25 October 1977 and closed in 2006 when it was absorbed into Gin Gin State School. In 1887, of land were resumed from the Gin Gin pastoral run. The land was offered for selection for the establishment of small farms on 17 April 1887. The Gin Gin Library opened in 1992. Population At the 2006 census, Gin Gin had a population of 892. In the 2011 census, Gin Gin had a population of 1,190 people. In the , Gin Gin had a population of 1,053 people. Heritage listings Gin Gin has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Mulgrave Street: Gin Gin railway station Economy Gin Gin, like Bundaberg, is heavily dependent on the sugar industry, with sugarcane plantations dotted throughout the area.

The Aylesbury Estate contains 2,704 dwellings, spread over a number of different blocks and buildings, and was built between 1963 and 1977. There are approximately 7,500 residents. The estate is currently undergoing a major regeneration programme. Major problems with the physical buildings on the estate and the poor perception of estates in Britain as a whole have led to the Aylesbury Estate gaining the title of \\"one of the most notorious estates in the United Kingdom\\". It has often been called the largest public housing estate in Europe, although this is difficult to verify with any accuracy. In 1997, Tony Blair chose to make his first speech as Prime Minister here, in an effort to demonstrate that the government would care for the poorest within society. The estate is often used as a typical example of urban decay. The Aylesbury Estate is an ethnically diverse area: according to the most recent census, around 25% of respondents were White British, with Black ethnic groups accounting for over half of all respondents. Around a third (34%) of residents are of school age, and fewer than 1 in 10 are aged 65 or above. Nearly two- thirds of respondents identified themselves as being Christian, with 17% being Muslim. History The estate was designed by architect Hans Peter \\"Felix\\" Trenton and construction started in 1963. Built on 285,000 square metres the estate was an attempt by planners to house some of London's poorest families. It was an effort of reconstruction as part of a comprehensive slum clearance policy by the Borough of Southwark. The 2,700 dwellings were designed to house a population of roughly 10,000 residents, making it one of the largest public housing estates in Europe. The estate is named after Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire and the various sections of the estate are named after other local towns and villages in Buckinghamshire including Foxcote, Wendover, Winslow, Padbury, Taplow, Ravenstone, Latimer and Chiltern. The estate's design embraces ideas of modernist urban planning as expressed by Le Corbusier in his 1935 vision of the Ville Radieuse, such as standardisation, free circulation of pedestrians and traffic and generous access to sunlight and natural ventilation. In the 1970s residents in the ground floor flats successfully campaigned for gardens to be fenced-off adjoining their flats. The final blocks of flats were completed in 1977 and the estate included a nursery, a day centre and a health centre. Taplow on Thurlow Street However, as old tenants moved out and new tenants came in, the estate went through a period of decline in the 1980s. The area is now considered to be in the bottom category on the ACORN classification for inner city adversity, signifying an area of extremely high social disadvantage. The buildings have been described as \\"poorly designed\\" by Labour Councillor Johnson Situ, and with constant problems and heating breakdowns as they near the end of their life. In 1999 the estate was awarded New Deal for Communities status and given £56.2m of central government funding (over 10 years). It was expected that this money would bring in £400m of housing association funding into the estate as part of a stock transfer deal. A tenant ballot was held on transfer to a housing association which was rejected by 73% of the votes on a 73% tenant turnout. Regeneration On 27 September 2005, the London Borough of Southwark decided that rather than spend £350 million updating the estate to basic living standards, it would order its demolition and replace the dwellings with modern houses controlled by a housing association. The plan involves increasing the density of housing from the current 2,700 units to 4,900. 2,288 units would remain social housing and the remainder would be for sale. The sale of these units is planned to fund the whole scheme. The regeneration of the Aylesbury Estate has been divided into several phases which will see the estate being re-built in 20 years.Aylesbury Estate regeneration The indicative phasing plan states when tenants plan to be re-housed and when leasehold properties would be bought by Southwark Council however, this timetable is subject to a certain amount of flux, until the development partner is appointed and the more detailed scheduling of the work can begin, which will offer greater certainty to residents about when they will need to move. The first Phase 1a was completed in August 2013, it lies near the south-west corner of the Aylesbury Estate and is divided into four development sites: A, C, B/E and D. This phase was developed with the L&Q; housing association. It comprises 261 units, and a new resource centre for adults with disabilities. It is a mixture of affordable and private housing, with existing Aylesbury residents given priority to move into the new buildings. Occupation In January 2015, following the March for Homes, a block on the estate was occupied by a group of squatters and housing activists in a protest against the demolition of the estate and the gentrification of London. Despite facing resistance from the police and security guards the occupation continued, shifting from block to block as the protesters faced eviction notices. The occupation gained press attention for its tactics and for the counter measures taken by Southwark Council—who installed security guards, security dogs, and a spiked fence to deter protesters. In popular culture The estate has featured in many television shows including The Bill, Spooks, and from 2004–15 was featured in a Channel 4 ident, in which the camera \\"tracks down rubbish-strewn balconies [while] other balconies and floating concrete structures shift into place forming the shape of the Channel 4 logo.\\" The washing lines, shopping trolley, rubbish bags and satellite dishes were, however, \\"all artificial embellishments added in by film-makers\\" to assist in what Ben Campkin, former director of the UCL Urban Laboratory, called the estate's depiction as \\"a desolate concrete dystopia [which] provides visual confirmation of tabloid journalists' descriptions of a 'ghost town' estate.\\" The ident was also the first and last of its respective series to be broadcast. In January 2014, Creation, a development trust for the estate, released a remake of the ident, produced and directed by Nick Street, and launched a campaign to persuade Channel 4 to use it instead of the original.

Cereta was the first to put women’s issues and her friendships with women front and center in her work. Cereta was one of the best scholars in Brescia, Verona, and Venice in 1488–92, known for her writing in the form of letters to other intellectuals.Cereta, Laura, and Diana Maury Robin. Collected letters of a Renaissance feminist. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997), 3. Her letters contained her personal matters and childhood memories, and discussed themes such as women’s education, war, and marriage.Cereta, Laura. \\"Letter to Augustinus Aemilius, Curse against the Ornamentation of Women.\\" Bizzell and Herzberg: 493-495. https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17399369654017720318&hl;=en&as;_sdt=20005&sciodt;=0,9/ (accessed October 24, 2014). Like the first great humanist Petrarch, Cereta claimed to seek fame and immortality through her writing. It appeared that her letters were intended for a general audience.King, Margaret L. \\"Petrarch, the Self-Conscious Self, and the First Women Humanists.\\" Journal of Medieval & Early Modern Studies 35, no. 3 (Fall2005 2005): 537,546. http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&sid;=7a26072c-ef21-4f96-970c-66b0d6134d73%40sessionmgr114&hid;=120/ (December 14, 2014).  Life and career Cereta was born in September 1469 in Brescia to a high-class family. She was a sickly child who suffered from sleeplessness.Robin, p.21 She was the first-born of six children. She had three brothers, Ippolito, Daniel and Basilio and two sisters, Deodata, and Diana. Her family was very popular in Italy due to her father's status. Silvestro Cereto was an attorney and a king's magistrate and her mother, Veronica di Leno, a famous businessperson. Since her father and Cereta believed in education, at age seven her father sent her to the convent.King, p. 549 There she devoted her life to intellectual pursuits and began her academics; she learned religious principles, reading, writing, and Latin with the prioress. The prioress had a big influence in Cereta's life as her teacher, and mentor. The prioress taught Cereta to use late night to predawn hours while everyone else slept to embroider, write, and study. At the age of seven, her teacher guided her courses in Latin grammar. She also taught her how to draw pictures utilizing a needle, which she practiced herself day and night. After two years at the convent, her father requested that Cereta come home to take care her siblings at the age of nine. After a few months at home, she went back to the convent for more schooling. At the age of twelve, her father summoned her again to come home to take on various household responsibilities. Among them, supervising her brothers' education and serving as her father's secretary. It is likely that her father guided her post- elementary studies.King, p. 538 At this time, Cereta showed great interest in mathematics, astrology, agriculture, and her favorite subject, moral philosophy.King, p. 537–8 In 1484, Cereta got married at age fifteen to Pietro Serina. Serina was a business merchant from Venice, yet had the same interests in academia. Difficulties between the two emerged in their marriage. In her letters to him, she wrote “You charge me with laziness and attack me for my long silence as though I were a defendant in court. You act as if I were the sort of person who would write to strangers and only neglect you, as though I were forgetful of you when in fact I accord you a place of honor above that of other learned men.” Gill, Amyrose Mccue. \\"Fraught Relations in the Letters of Laura Cereta: Marriage, Friendship, and Humanist Epistolarity.\\" Renaissance Quarterly 62, no. 4 (Winter2009 2009): 111. http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=ac675e7e-b591-496d-a8a0-2f521f61998b%40sessionmgr4002&vid;=2&hid;=4111/ (accessed December 14, 2014). Despite the arguments, for Cereta, this was one of the happiest moments in her lifetime. In her letters, she imagined an ideal marriage as a partnership overseen by mutual honor, respect, honesty, and love. Cereta never regarded one's marriage as a kind of friendship, nor did she ever directly call her husband a friend. Nonetheless, in her letters, the languages of marriage and friendship were clearly delineated, focusing the readers' attention upon the reciprocal relations like mutual love, communication. She often focused the readers' attention on mutual relations such as love, communication and responsibility that manage both spousal and friendship. After eighteen months of marriage, her husband died due to a plague. The two had no children and she never remarried. Cereta finally recovered her spirits two years after the death of her husband and began immersing herself more deeply in her literary studies and works. She continued writing her letters to a close circle of family and friends, discussing personal concerns such as her difficult relationships with her mother and her husband. These letters also provided a detailed description of an early modern woman’s private experiences. Taken together, these letters are evidences of an individual woman and to her persistent feminist concerns. She defended the concept of educating women and objected the abuse of married women. Furthermore, in her public lectures and essays, Cereta explored the history of women's contributions to the intellectual and political life of Europe. She argued against the slavery of women in marriage and for the rights of women to higher education, the same issues that would occupy feminist thinkers in later centuries.Collected Letters of a Renaissance Feminist by Laura Cereta, 1997  Online Research Library: Questia.https://www.questia.com/library/1918854/collected-letters-of-a- renaissance-feminist/ (Accessed December 1, 2014). Because of these themes, scholars such as Diana Robin consider her an early feminist. Throughout this time, she faced many critics, both male and female, who were jealous of her accomplishments and criticized her works. The two principal charges brought against her were that a woman should not receive an education and that her works were plagiarized, with her father writing them for her. She turned against her critics with aggressiveness. In response to one of her critics, Bibulus Sepromius, Laura said: > MY EARS ARE WEARIED BY YOUR CARPING. YOU brashly and publicly not merely > wonder but indeed lament that I am said to possess as fine a mind as nature > ever bestowed upon the most learned man. You seem to think that so learned a > woman has scarcely before been seen in the world. You are wrong on both > counts, Sempronius, and have dearly strayed from the path of truth and > disseminate falsehood…You pretend to admire me as a female prodigy, but > there lurks sugared deceit in your adulation. You wait perpetually in ambush > to entrap my lovely sex, and overcome by your hatred seek to trample me > underfoot and dash me to the earth.King, Margaret L., and Albert Rabil. > 1983. Her immaculate hand: selected works by and about the women humanists > of Quattrocento Italy. (Binghamton, N.Y.: Center for Medieval & Early > Renaissance Studies, 1983), 81-84. In 1488, Cereta assembled 82 of her letters into a volume. The volume was based on the Petrarchan model called “Epistolae Familiares” and written with a burlesque dialogue on the \\"death of an ass\\". She dedicated it to her patron, Cardinal Ascanio Sforza. Her works circulated widely in Italy during the early modern era. However, this volume remained unpublished until the seventeenth century. The manuscript circulated from 1488 to 1492 among humanists in Brescia, Verona, and Venice.Robin, p.6 It is suspected that she did this to seek legitimization as a writer. Six months after her letters were published, her father died. After his death, she no longer felt inspired to write.Julie, Kane. n.d. \\"Letter from Laura Cereta: Brescia, 1488.\\" http://quod.lib.umich.edu/f/fs/0499697.0020.308/1#?/ (accessed October 24, 2014). Death Laura Cereta died in 1499 between the ages of 29 and 30. Her cause of death is unknown. None of her writings from the later years of her life survived. She was honored with a public funeral and festivities in Brescia, which was uncommon for women.Robin, p.7 She is remembered as a great woman who laid out the groundwork for many feminist and humanist writers after the Renaissance.

He was born in Cassano d'Adda, in what is now the province of Milan in Lombardy. He studied architecture in the University of Pavia, but when he was twenty, he fled from Lombardy (at the time under Austrian domination) to enroll in the Piedmont army. He was a volunteer in the Second Italian Independence War and in the 1866 war against Austria, at which point he gained a silver medal in the Battle of Custoza and was promoted Captain. In 1872 Perrucchetti proposed the creation of an infantry corps specialized in mountain warfare, for the defense of the mountainous Italian border, in an article published in the Italian military journal Rivista Militare Italiana. Perrucchetti drew examples from the mountain militias in the Roman age, the Cacciatori delle Alpi brigades, and the Volontari Cadorini led by Pier Fortunato Calvi. His proposal (although not the only one in its kind) is considered to have been the basis for the foundation of the Alpini by General Cesare Ricotti-Magnani, then-Minister of War, in the same year. Curiously, though, Perrucchetti never joined the corps, nor did he ever command it. Perucchetti later rose to the rank of Lieutenant General, and was appointed a Senator of the Kingdom of Italy; he retired in 1910. He died in 1916, when the Alpini were operating in the Alps and in Africa during World War I.

Bush poses for a photo with excited sailors immediately prior to giving his \\"Mission Accomplished\\" speech USS Abraham Lincoln returning to port carrying the Mission Accomplished banner The S-3B Viking \\"Navy One\\" was retired and put in display at the National Museum of Naval Aviation. USS Abraham Lincoln President George W. Bush on the Abraham Lincoln being saluted by the flight deck crew The Mission Accomplished speech (named for a banner displayed above the speaker) was a televised address by United States President George W. Bush on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln on May 1, 2003. Although Bush stated at the time \\"Our mission continues\\" and \\"We have difficult work to do in Iraq,\\" he also stated it was the end to major combat operations in Iraq. Bush never uttered the phrase \\"Mission Accomplished\\"; a banner stating \\"Mission Accomplished\\" was used as a backdrop to the speech. Bush's assertion—and the sign itself—became controversial after guerrilla warfare in Iraq increased during the Iraqi insurgency. The vast majority of casualties, both military and civilian, occurred after the speech. Description On May 1, 2003, Bush became the first sitting President to arrive in an arrested landing in a fixed-wing aircraft on an aircraft carrierRichard Nixon had landed aboard the USS Hornet in a helicopter for the Apollo 11 recovery, but not in an arrested landing. when he arrived at the USS Abraham Lincoln in a Lockheed S-3 Viking, dubbed Navy One, as the carrier lay just off the San Diego coast, having returned from combat operations in the Persian Gulf. He posed for photographs with pilots and members of the ship's crew while wearing a flight suit. A few hours later, he gave a speech announcing the end of major combat operations in the Iraq War. Far above him was the warship's banner stating \\"Mission Accomplished.\\" Writing in The Wall Street Journal, Lisa Schiffren, a former speechwriter for former vice president Dan Quayle, praised Bush for appearing not only \\"really hot\\" but \\"credible as a commander in chief. But mostly 'hot' as in virile, sexy and powerful.\\"The Nation: George W--Hottie Flyboy? May 12, 2003. Accessed February 9, 2015. However, Bush was criticized for the historic jet landing on the carrier as an overly theatrical and expensive stunt. For instance, it was pointed out that the carrier was well within range of Bush's helicopter, and that a jet landing was not needed. Originally the White House had stated that the carrier was too far off the California coast for a helicopter landing and a jet would be needed to reach it. On the day of the speech, the Lincoln was only from shore but the administration still decided to go ahead with the jet landing. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer admitted that Bush \\"could have helicoptered, but the plan was already in place. Plus, he wanted to see a landing the way aviators see a landing.\\" The Lincoln made a scheduled stop in Pearl Harbor shortly before the speech, docked in San Diego after the speech, and returned to her home port in Everett, Washington on May 6, 2003. The S-3 that served as \\"Navy One\\" was retired from service and placed on display at the National Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola, Florida on July 17, 2003. The museum makes it clear that Bush was a passenger – not the pilot – of the plane. While Bush trained and served as a jet pilot in the Air National Guard flying F-102 fighter-interceptors, he was never trained to land on a carrier. The banner stating \\"Mission Accomplished\\" was a focal point of controversy and criticism. Navy Commander and Pentagon spokesman Conrad Chun said the banner referred specifically to the aircraft carrier's 10-month deployment (which was the longest deployment of a carrier since the Vietnam War) and not the war itself, saying \\"It truly did signify a mission accomplished for the crew.\\" The White House claimed that the banner was requested by the crew of the ship, who did not have the facilities for producing such a banner. Afterward, the administration and naval sources stated that the banner was the Navy's idea, White House staff members made the banner, and it was hung by the U.S. Navy personnel. White House spokesman Scott McClellan told CNN, \\"We took care of the production of it. We have people to do those things. But the Navy actually put it up.\\" According to John Dickerson of Time magazine, the White House later conceded that they hung the banner but still insists it had been done at the request of the crew members. Whether meant for the crew or not, the general impression created by the image of Bush under the banner has been criticized as premature, especially later as the guerrilla war began. Subsequently, the White House released a statement saying that the sign and Bush's visit referred to the initial invasion of Iraq. Bush's speech noted: The speech also said that: When he received an advance copy of the speech, U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld took care to remove any use of the phrase \\"Mission Accomplished\\" in the speech itself. Later, when journalist Bob Woodward asked him about his changes to the speech, Rumsfeld responded: \\"I was in Baghdad, and I was given a draft of that thing to look at. And I just died, and I said my God, it's too conclusive. And I fixed it and sent it back... they fixed the speech, but not the sign.\\" Bush did offer a \\"Mission Accomplished\\" message to the troops in Afghanistan at Camp As Sayliyah on June 5, 2003 – about a month after the aircraft carrier speech: \\"America sent you on a mission to remove a grave threat and to liberate an oppressed people, and that mission has been accomplished.\\" For critics of the war, the photo-op became a symbol of the Bush administration's unrealistic goals and perceptions of the conflict. Anti-war activists questioned the integrity and realism of Bush's \\"major combat\\" statement. The banner came to symbolize the irony of Bush giving a victory speech only a few weeks after the beginning of the fifth longest war in American history. US military deaths in Iraq war at 4,452 In a less publicized incident, Rumsfeld also declared an end to major combat operations in Afghanistan on May 1, a few hours before Bush's announcement. Subsequent comments In November 2008, soon after the presidential election in which Democrat Barack Obama was chosen to succeed him, Bush indicated that he regretted the use of the banner, stating in a CNN interview, \\"To some, it said, well, 'Bush thinks the war in Iraq is over,' when I didn't think that. It conveyed the wrong message.\\" In January 2009, Bush said that \\"Clearly, putting 'Mission Accomplished' on an aircraft carrier was a mistake.\\" In culture Iraq War opponents have used the phrase \\"mission accomplished\\" in an ironic sense, while others have non- politically cited it as an example of a general public relations failure. In addition, some mainstream outlets questioned the state of the war with derivatives of this statement. For example, the October 6, 2003 cover of Time featured the headline \\"Mission Not Accomplished.\\" On April 30, 2008, White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said \\"President Bush is well aware that the banner should have been much more specific and said 'mission accomplished for these sailors who are on this ship on their mission.' And we have certainly paid a price for not being more specific on that banner.\\" On May 5, 2008, The Daily Show mocked her statement by producing a graphic of what such a sign might have looked like.May 5, 2008 The Daily Show clip commenting on the famous banner. American deaths in the Iraq War totaled 104 when President Bush gave his Mission Accomplished speech. After that speech another 3,424 Americans were killed in the Iraq War (as of February 2011, when American combat operations there halted). *In 2004, comedic writer Wayne Lammers wrote and sang a song titled \\"Mission Accomplished\\" which was included in the Grammy-nominated CD, \\"The Best of the Al Franken Show\\" and on his own 2004 CD of satirical songs, \\"GOP Party Monsters\\". *In 2004, the HBO original series The Wire ended its third season with an episode titled \\"Mission Accomplished\\". In an audio commentary for that episode, the show's creator David Simon said that the third season of the show symbolized the War in Iraq. *In 2004, the Fox television show Arrested Development mocked the Mission Accomplishment speech and banner in the episode \\"The One Where They Build a House.\\" The episode features the unveiling of a \\"Mission Accomplished\\" banner after the Bluth family constructs a fake model home. The banner gag returns in two later episodes, \\"The Immaculate Election\\" and \\"The Cabin Show.\\" *A 2007 episode of the NBC comedy drama Scrubs showed the central character J.D. trying to learn about the Iraq War by reading the (fictitious) book Iraq War for Dummies. He complains that \\"I just got to the point where President Bush gave his \\"mission accomplished\\" speech on a battleship and I still got, like, 400 more pages to go.\\" *In March 2008 a book entitled Mission Accomplished! (or How We Won the War in Iraq) was released. A continuation of the \\"Experts Speak\\" series from the Institute of Expertology, this book by Christopher Cerf and Victor Navasky, with illustrations by Robert Grossman, is a compilation of hundreds of quotations from prominent figures in the media and government concerning military operations in Iraq. *The May 10, 2009 episode of The Simpsons, entitled \\"Four Great Women and a Manicure\\", depicted Queen Elizabeth I (as played by Patty Bouvier) standing under a \\"Miſſion Accomplished\\" banner on the shores of England, prior to a battle between the heavily outnumbered English Navy and the Spanish Armada. * The 2005 song \\"Dirty Harry\\" from British alternative band Gorillaz' contains the lyrics: \\"The war is over, so says the speaker with the flight suit on\\", a reference to the \\"Mission Accomplished\\" speech. *In 2008, the band Third Eye Blind's song \\"Non Dairy Creamer\\" includes the lyrics \\"Mission Accomplished\\" as a satire of American society's corruption. *In 2009, the comedy trio The Lonely Island's video for I'm on a Boat, Andy Samberg was depicted in a flight suit while rapping in front of reporters, parodying the flight suit worn by President Bush. *In 2012, Saturday Night Live had Will Ferrell reprise his role as George W. Bush where his skit had the line \\"Mission Accomplished! It's just something I like to say when a problem isn't solved, but I don't like to talk about it anymore.\\" *In 2014, energy drink company Red Bull used the question \\"Mission not yet accomplished?\\" for promotional signs in Kangaroo Express convenience stores. *On April 14, 2018, President Donald Trump tweeted \\"Mission Accomplished!\\" following a US-led airstrike on Syria in response to the alleged use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime. Critics were quick to point out the similarities to Bush's speech. *Released on the 4th of July, 2018, Iraqi rapper IN-Z referenced the speech with a copy of the Mission Accomplished banner in the backdrop of the music video for This is Iraq, his This Is America parody.

Its current principal is Randy Milliken. NMB High School was built in 1971 as an overcrowding reliever school for North Miami High School and Miami Norland High School. NMB High School was a pioneer in school construction; it was the first high school in Dade County to be built with no windows, and was therefore completely air-conditioned. History NMB High School's style of education, with no traditional letter grades, created tension within middle- and upper-middle-class North Dade County families, whose older children had attended and graduated from traditional Dade County schools. They were not happy that their younger children would be placed in an experimental school that eschewed the traditions the parents knew, as the Miami Herald reported at the time. However, by the time the school was four years old, the non- traditional approach had been abandoned. NMB had an award-winning TV Production program led by teacher Patrica Nelson Miller from the late 1970s through the 1990s and early 2000s. The revolutionary program included a video yearbook, daily closed-circuit newscast and both prosumer and professional equipment. Alan Page was responsible for all technical facilities and worked closely with students and teachers to maintain equipment. Mr. Page in 1996 started a fist fight with the then General Manager Robert Berger. The student in question (Robert Berger) subsequently broke Mr. Page's jaw. The video yearbooks would have a student general manager and utilize a different theme each year. In 1994 the theme of the video yearbook was \\"Friends\\" and utilized a shot for shot recreation of the opening of the then wildly popular Warner Bros. sitcom \\"Friends\\". The high school's newspaper was called The Charger Times. Among its editors was David Rutman. NMB High School has a Biomedical and Environmental Advancement Magnet program (BEAM) available to all students in the district. The program gives higher education credits to students wishing to pursue a career in medicine or environmental sciences. In the summer of 2005, the school added a two-story building to its campus.

During World War I, while theoretically a neutral country, British pressure prompted the government to favour Britain highly in relation to Norway's large shipping fleet and vast fish supplies. The term was coined by Norwegian historian Olav Riste in the 1960s. In 1905, when Norway gained independence, the nation's politicians agreed that Norway should remain neutral in international conflicts. Since the Great Powers had no desire for unrest in Scandinavia, they signed an agreement respecting Norway's neutrality. Still, the political direction was clear: fearing Russian ambition in the north, the sentiment was that Norway should be neutral if war broke out, and rely on help from Great Britain if attacked. This affinity westwards was substantiated by international trade. In the early 1900s, Norway's merchant fleet was one of the largest in the world, and the country required vast supplies of oil, coal and steel to build and operate it. When war broke out in 1914, Norway was exporting great amounts of fish to Germans and British alike, much to the dismay of the British government. The Allies started preventing the Germans from purchasing these fish stocks by overbidding them, but trade in other areas continued. Imports of Norwegian copper ore, nickel and pyrite were vital to the German war industry, and by the end of 1916, Norway's Government was put under heavy pressure. Several agreements were made, none completely satisfying to the British. On Christmas Eve 1916, the British government issued an ultimatum, informing the Norwegian Foreign Minister, Nils Claus Ihlen, that British exports of coal to Norway would cease unless trade with Germany stopped. The Norwegian government weighed their options, and eventually agreed to the ultimatum. This coincided with Germany's expansion of unrestricted submarine warfare at the beginning of 1917. In total, 436NAA: A5954, 192/34 http://www.naa.gov.au/go.aspx?i=645339 Norwegian ships were sunk in the period 1914–1917, out of 847 in the course of the whole war. More than 1150 sailors died during this period, creating an increasingly anti-German sentiment throughout the shipping nation of Norway. Thus, both commerce and political sympathies tied Norway and Britain together during World War I, even though Norway remained officially neutral.

In the genus Polacanthus several species have been named but only the type species Polacanthus foxii is today seen as valid. Polacanthus was a quadrupedal ornithischian or \\"bird-hipped\\" dinosaur. It lived 130 to 125 million years ago in what is now western Europe.Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2012) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages,https://www.geol.umd.edu/~tholtz/dinoappendix/appendix.html Polacanthus foxii was named after a find on the Isle of Wight in 1865. There are not many fossil remains of this creature, and some important anatomical features, such as its skull, are poorly known. Early depictions often gave it a very generic head as it was only known from the rear half of the creature. It grew to about long. Its body was covered with armour plates and spikes. It possibly was a basal member of the Nodosauridae. Discovery and species Historical P. foxii skeletal restoration by Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás Polacanthus foxii was discovered by the Reverend William Fox on the Isle of Wight in 1865, at Barnes High at the southwest coast. Fox at first planned to have his friend Alfred Tennyson name the new dinosaur. Tennyson proposed Euacanthus Vectianus but this name was ultimately rejected.Tennyson, H., 1897, \\"Note about Polacanthus\\", In: Alfred Lord Tennyson, A memoir by his son, The MacMillan Company, p. 23-24 In 1865, Fox in a lecture to the British Association reported on the find and let it be named Polacanthus foxii by Richard Owen, hereby circumventing the convention that an author does not name a taxon after himself.Fox W. (1865). \\"On a new Wealden saurian named Polacanthus\\". Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, 1865 for 1864, p. 56 The text of the lecture was more or less reproduced by him in an anonymous article in the Illustrated London News. This procedure caused some confusion as no corresponding 1865 publication by Owen exists. Some have therefore contended that Thomas Huxley in 1867 became the author of the name,Huxley, T.H., 1867, \\"On Acanthopholis horridus, a new reptile from the Chalk Marl\\", Geological Magazine, 4: 65-67 others give Fox, Owen or \\"Anonymous\\" as the author. The generic name is derived from Greek πολύς, polys, \\"many\\" and ἄκανθα, akantha, \\"thorn\\", in reference to the many spikes of the armour. The specific name honours Fox. Fossils figured in Hulke, 1881 The holotype, BMNH R175, was found in a layer of the Upper Wessex Formation dating from the Barremian. It is an incomplete skeleton with the head, neck, anterior armour and forelimbs missing but including dorsal vertebrae, the sacrum, most of the pelvis, most of the left hindleg, the right thighbone, twenty-two tail vertebrae, ribs, chevrons, ossified tendons, a pelvic shield, twenty-two spikes and numerous ossicles. The skeleton was in 1881 studied by John Whitaker Hulke, while it was still in the possession of Fox. Hulke published the first detailed description of the find, noting that the specimen had badly deteriorated over the years, the dermal armour having almost fully fallen apart.Hulke, J.W., 1881, \\"Polacanthus foxii, a large undescribed dinosaur from the Wealden Formation in the Isle of Wight\\", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 172: 653–662 The same year Fox died, his collection was acquired by the British Museum of Natural History, including the Polacanthus fossil. This was then reassembled by preparator Caleb Barlow, painstakingly putting all the pieces together with Canada balsam, much to the wonder of Hulke who in 1881 had called this a hopeless undertaking. This allowed Hulke to redescribe the specimen in 1887, with a special attention to the armour arrangement.Hulke, J.W., 1887, \\"Supplemental Note on Polacanthus Foxii, Describing the Dorsal Shield and Some Parts of the Endoskeleton, Imperfectly Known in 1881\\", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. B 178: 169–172 In 1905, the specimen was again described by Franz Nopcsa who for the first time provided an illustration of the possible spike configuration.Nopcsa, F., 1905, \\"Notes on British dinosaurs. Part II. Polacanthus\\", Geological Magazine 2: 241-250 Material at NHM, London Later it was realised that, at one occasion at least, even before 1865 probable Polacanthus fossils had been found. In 1843 John Edward Lee reported the discovery on Wight of two armour specimens.Lee, J.E., 1843, \\"Notice of Saurian Dermal Plates from the Wealden of the Isle of Wight\\", Annals and Magazine of Natural History 11: 5-7 Numerous specimens from Wight and Great Britain have since been referred to Polacanthus. These mostly consist of single bones or armour elements. A second partial skeleton, from which parts had been removed since 1876, was identified and fully excavated by Dr William T. Blows in 1979; it is also in the London Natural History Museum as specimen NHMUK R9293. It is the first specimen to show skull elements, neck vertebrae and unequivocal anterior armour.Blows W.T. (1987). The armoured dinosaur Polacanthus foxi, from the Lower Cretaceous of the Isle of Wight, Palaeontology. 30, 557–580 Several ankylosaurian remains from the Early Cretaceous of continental Europe have been referred to Polacanthus but none demonstrably share any unique traits, or autapomorphies, with its holotype. =Further species and genera= Estimated size based on the holotype. Apart from the two species today considered valid, several other species and genera have been named in relation to the Polacanthus material. In 1924, Edwin Hennig named a Polacanthus becklesi, the specific name honouring collector Samuel Beckles, based on specimen BMNH R1926, a piece of an ilium associated with armour plates, found on Wight in the nineteenth century.Hennig, E., 1924, \\"Kentrurosaurus aethiopicus. Die Stegosaurier-Funde vom Tendaguru, Deutsch- Ostafrika\\", Palaeontographica Supplement 7: 101-254 Today this is considered a junior synonym of P. foxii. It was assumed to be a different species because the armour is smoother on top, but this was likely caused by water erosion of the fossil. In 1987, William T. Blows claimed that the American Hoplitosaurus was a species of Polacanthus, renaming it into Polacanthus marshi. Though this gained some popularity in the early 1990s,Pereda-Suberbiola, J., 1994, \\"Polacanthus (Ornithischia, Ankylosauria), a transatlantic armoured dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous of Europe and North America\\", Palaeontographica Abteilung A 232(4-6): 133-159 today the identity is generally rejected. In 1996, a Polacanthus rudgwickensis was named by Blows,Blows W.T. (1996) \\"A new species of Polacanthus (Ornithischia; Ankylosauria) from the Lower Cretaceous of Sussex, England\\". Geological Magazine, 133 (6): 671-682 after a review of some fossil material found in 1985 and thought to have been Iguanodon, which was on display at the Horsham Museum in Sussex. The material, holotype HORSM 1988.1546, is fragmentary and includes several incomplete vertebrae, a partial scapulocoracoid, the distal end of a humerus, a nearly complete right tibia, rib fragments, and two osteoderms. P. rudgwickensis seems to have been about 30% longer than type species P. foxii and differs from it in numerous characters of the vertebrae and dermal armour. It is named after the village of Rudgwick in West Sussex and was discovered at a Rudgwick Brickworks Company quarry, at the quarry floor in gray-green marl beds of the Wessex Formation. Barremian age, approximately 124–132 million years ago. In 2015, Blows made it a separate genus Horshamosaurus.Blows, W.T., 2015, British Polacanthid Dinosaurs – Observations on the History and Palaeontology of the UK Polacanthid Armoured Dinosaurs and their Relatives, Siri Scientific Press, 220 pp In 1971, Polacanthus foxii was by Walter Coombs renamed into Hylaeosaurus foxi.Coombs, W. 1971. The Ankylosauria. Ph.D. thesis, New York: Columbia University This has found no acceptance, and the name is an invalid nomen ex dissertatione. Also it has been suggested that Polacanthus would be simply identical to Hylaeosaurus armatus. This was rejected by Blows in 1987, because of differences in age and anatomy. A possible identity is hard to prove or disprove as there are few overlapping elements in their holotypes.Barrett, P.M. and Maidment, S.C.R. 2011. \\"Wealden armoured dinosaurs\\". In: Batten, D.J. (ed.). English Wealden fossils. Palaeontological Association, London, Field Guides to Fossils 14, 769 pp In 1928, Nopcsa named a new genus and species Polacanthoides ponderosus, based on a number of syntypes: BMNH 2584, a left scapula found at Bolney which in 1841 by Gideon Mantell had been referred to Hylaeosaurus;Mantell, G.A., 1841, \\"Memoir on a portion of the lower jaw of the Iguanodon and on the remains of the Hylaeosaurus and other saurians, discovered in the strata of Tilgate Forest, in Sussex\\", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 131: 131–151 and BMNH R1106 en 1107, a tibia and humerus.Nopcsa, F., 1928, \\"Palaeontological notes on Reptiles\\", Geologica Hungarica, Series Palaeontologica, tomus, 1, -Pasc. 1, p. 1-84 The new taxon has proven to be very problematic. Contrary to what Nopcsa assumed the tibia and humerus were not found at Bolney but on Wight. This makes Polacanthoides a possible chimera, especially since their provenance from Wight makes it likely they belonged to Polacanthus. Furthermore, the Wight specimens are not the original bones, which have been lost, but casts which at best could have been used as plastotypes. The scapula belongs to an indeterminate thyreophoran. In 1982 Justin Delair named a genus Vectensia, without providing a specific name, based on specimen GH 981.45, an armour plate. Like the holotype of Polacanthus it was found at Barnes High, but reportedly in an older layer, of the Lower Wessex Formation.Delair, J.B., 1982, \\"Notes on an armoured dinosaur from Barnes High, Isle of Wight\\", Proceedings of the Isle of Wight Natural History and Archaeological Society for 1980, 7(5): 297-302 Blows in 1987 tentatively referred it to Polacanthus. Description Hypothetical P. foxii restoration, based mostly on Gastonia Polacanthus was a medium-sized ankylosaur. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at 5 meters (16 ft), its weight at 2 tonnes (2.2 short tons).Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 229 Thomas Holtz gave a lower estimation of 4 meters (13 ft) and 227-454 kg (500-1.000 lbs) in 2012. Its hindlimbs are relatively long for an ankylosaur, with a right femur length of 555 millimetres with the holotype. In 2011 Barrett e.a. indicated two possible unique traits, autapomorphies: the floor of the neural canal is deeply cut by a groove with a V-shaped transverse profile; the caudal spikes have triangular bases in side view and narrow points. Tibia, vertebra and scutes The subsequent describers have always dedicated much effort at restoring the armour configuration. Hulke understood that Polacanthus had a large \\"pelvic shield\\" or \\"sacral shield\\", a single fused sheet of dermal bone over its hips (sacral area) which perhaps was not attached to the underlying bone and decorated with tubercles. This feature is shared with other \\"polacanthine\\" (basal nodosaurids) dinosaurs such as Gastonia and Mymoorapelta. With the holotype, this shield is 108 centimetres wide and 90 centimetres long. It features four horizontal rows of larger keeled osteoderms per side, surrounded by smaller ossicles. These latter are sometimes completely fused to form flat armour plates. Hulke thought that on the tail there were two rows of keeled osteoderms per side. Of a set of spikes found with the fossil, he assumed they had adorned the sides of the rump. A different arrangement was hypothesised by Nopcsa. He thought that both the tail and the front of the body including the neck featured two parallel rows of spikes, one per side. On the front body each row would have consisted of five spikes and he claimed that seven of these had been conserved with the fossil, five of the right side and two of the left. The tail rows would have consisted of twenty-two shorter pairs, fifteen spikes being still extant, eight of the left side and seven of the right. As the spikes are asymmetrical their position can more or less be deduced. Blows in 1987 basically agreed with Nopcsa but also distinguished three spike types, a Type A, B and C, allowing him to classify additional fossil finds, which often differed from the holotype spikes in several details. In 2013 a footprint was found by Henley Hobbs and his father on the Isle of Wight. Now a picture of the footprint is inside the dinosaur farm. Phylogeny Tail, centrum, and scute fragments Vertebra and scute Fox in 1865 assigned Polacanthus to the Dinosauria, Huxley in 1870T.H. Huxley, 1870, \\"On the classification of the Dinosauria, with observations on the Dinosauria of the Trias\\", Quarterly Review of the Geological Society of London 26: 32-51 and Hulke in 1881 assigned it to the Scelidosauridae. Its exact affinities were not well understood, until Coombs in 1978 placed in the Nodosauridae within a larger Ankylosauria.W.P. Coombs, 1978, \\"The families of the ornithischian dinosaur order Ankylosauria\\", Palaeontology 21(1): 143-170 In 1996 Kenneth Carpenter e.a. refined this to the Polacanthinae.K. Carpenter, J. I.

Burge, 1996, \\"Evolutionary significance of new ankylosaurs (Dinosauria) from the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous, Western Interior\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 16(3, supplement):25A An alternative hypothesis, first suggested by Tracy Lee Ford in 2000,T.L.

Traditionally classified as an early member of the family Hadrosauridae, a 2008 analysis found Claosaurus agilis to be outside of the clade containing Hadrosaurus and other hadrosaurids, making it the closest not-hadrosaurid relative of true hadrosaurids within the clade Hadrosauria. Description Claosaurus had a slender body and slim feet, with long legs, small arms, and a long, stiff tail. It probably grew to a length of about 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) and weighed roughly 475 kg. It appears to have walked on its hind legs, dropping to all fours only to graze. Like other hadrosaurs, it was an herbivore.  History  A Cretoxyrhina and two Squalicorax circling around a dead Claosaurus in the Western Interior Seaway Evidence of its existence was first found in the Niobrara Formation near the Smoky Hill River in Kansas, United States in the form of partial skull fragments and as an articulated postcranial skeleton. Originally named Hadrosaurus agilis (Marsh, 1872), it was placed in a new genus and renamed Claosaurus agilis in 1890 when major differences between this specimen and Hadrosaurus came to light. In 1892, Marsh named a second species, C. annectens. This species later was reassigned to Anatosaurus and then Edmontosaurus, where it is currently. G. R. Wieland named third species C. affinis in 1903, which he compared to C. annectens. C. affinis was founded on remains from the Pierre Shale of South Dakota, found in association with remains of the giant sea turtle Archelon. At some point after its description, the fragmentary remains were mixed up with the original remains of C. agilis, and a toe bone from C. agilis was accidentally thought to be the only part of the holotype remains that could be located. This was corrected by Joseph Gregory in 1948, who found three toe bones from the right foot of a large hadrosaur in the Yale collections that had comparable preservation to the Pierre Shale turtle remains and were associated with labels in Wieland's handwriting. Gregory found the toe bones to be very similar in size to the corresponding bones of Marsh's Claosaurus annectens, but did not reassign the species due to its much older age and fragmentary remains. \\"C. affinis\\" was considered a dubious hadrosaur in the 2004 review by Jack Horner and colleagues. They reported its type material as lost, although they also reported these remains as only including a single toe bone, instead of the three toe bones of Gregory. Reports of gastroliths, or stomach stones, in Claosaurus are actually based on a probable double misidentification. First, the specimen is actually of Edmontosaurus annectens. Barnum Brown, who discovered the specimen in 1900, referred to it as Claosaurus, because E. annectens was thought to be a species of Claosaurus at the time. Additionally, it is more likely that the supposed gastroliths represent gravel washed in during burial. See also * Timeline of hadrosaur research Notes This species is not accepted as representing Claosaurus in reviews of the genus, but has not been given its own genus and is unlikely to receive one.

Description Restoration of T. proriger A distinguishing characteristic of Tylosaurus is its elongated, cylindrical premaxilla (snout) from which it takes its name. Unlike other mosasaurs, Tylosaurus did not have teeth all the way forward on its premaxilla, as the bony protuberance was free of teeth. Tylosaurus also have 24 to 26 teeth in the upper jaw, 20 to 22 teeth on the palate, 26 teeth on the lower jaw, 29 to 30 vertebrate between the skull and hip, 6 to 7 vertebrae in the hip, 33 to 34 vertebrae in the tail with chevrons, and a further 56 to 58 vertebrae making up the tip of the tail. Early restorations showing Tylosaurus with a dorsal crest were based on misidentified tracheal cartilage, but when the error was discovered, depicting mosasaurs with such crests was already a trend. Its skin had many small scales. =Size= Estimated size range of Tylosaurus compared with a human Along with plesiosaurs, sharks, fish, and other mosasaurs, Tylosaurus was a dominant predator of the Western Interior Seaway during the Late Cretaceous. The genus was among the largest of the mosasaurs (along with Mosasaurus hoffmannii), with the possibly conspecific Hainosaurus bernardi reaching lengths up to , and T. pembinensis reaching comparable sizes. T. proriger, the largest species of Tylosaurus, reached lengths of about . In late 2014 the Guinness World Records awarded the Canadian Fossil Discovery Centre in Morden with a record for Largest Publicly Displayed Mosasaur - Bruce. The record was added to the 2016 print edition of the Guinness World Records. Discovery and naming The skull of MCZ 4374, the holotype of T. proriger Like many other mosasaurs, the early history of this taxon is complex and involves the infamous rivalry between two early American paleontologists, Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh. Originally, the name \\"Macrosaurus\\" proriger was proposed by Cope for a fragmentary skull and thirteen vertebrae collected from near Monument Rocks in western Kansas in 1868.Cope ED. 1869. [Remarks on Macrosaurus proriger.] Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia 11(81): 123. It was placed in the collections of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology. Only a year later, Cope redescribed the same material in greater detail and referred it, instead, to the English mosasaur taxon Liodon. Then, in 1872, Marsh named a more complete specimen as a new genus, Rhinosaurus (\\"nose lizard\\"), but soon discovered that this name had already been used for a different animal. Cope suggested that Rhinosaurus be replaced by yet another new name, Rhamposaurus which also proved to be preoccupied. Marsh finally erected Tylosaurus later in 1872, to include the original Harvard material as well as additional, more complete specimens which had also been collected from Kansas.Marsh OC. 1872. Note on Rhinosaurus. American Journal of Science 4 (20): 147. A giant specimen of T. proriger, recovered in 1911 by C. D. Bunker near Wallace, Kansas is one of the largest skeletons of Tylosaurus ever found. It is currently on display at the University of Kansas Museum of Natural history. T. proriger specimen which was found with a plesiosaur in its stomach Complete T. proriger skeleton, from H.F. Osborn's 1899 description In 1918, Charles H. Sternberg found a Tylosaurus, with the remains of a plesiosaur in its stomach. The specimen is currently on display in the Smithsonian, while the plesiosaur remains are stored in the collections. Although these important specimens were briefly reported by Sternberg in 1922 the find was largely overlooked until 2001. This specimen was rediscovered and described by Michael J. Everhart in 2004. This find formed the basis for the story line in the 2007 National Geographic IMAX movie Sea Monsters: A Prehistoric Adventure, and a book Sea Monsters: Prehistoric Creatures of the Deep. A photograph of a Tylosaurus skull was taken by George F. Sternberg about 1926 after he collected and prepared the specimen. It was discovered in the Smoky Hill Chalk of Logan County, Kansas. Sternberg offered the specimen to the Smithsonian and included a photograph in his letter to Charles Gilmore. Copies of the original photos are in the archives of the Sternberg Museum of Natural History (FHSM). The specimen is FHSM VP-3, the exhibit specimen in the same museum. A long Tylosaurus found in Kansas by Alan Komrosky in 2009 is now on display at the Museum of World Treasures in Wichita, Kansas. Tylosaurus has now been described from formations in Saskatchewan and South Dakota.

They are as follows: Tylosaurus proriger (Cope, 1869), from the Santonian and lower to middle Campanian of North America (Kansas, Alabama, Nebraska, etc.) and Tylosaurus nepaeolicus (Cope, 1874Cope ED. 1874. Review of the vertebrata of the Cretaceous period found west of the Mississippi River. U. S. Geological Survey of the Territories, Bulletin 1 (2): 3-48.), from the Santonian of North America (Kansas). Tylosaurus kansasensis, named by Everhart in 2005 from the late Coniacian of Kansas, has been shown to be based on juvenile specimens of T. nepaeolicus.Paulina Jiménez-Huidobro, Tiago R. Simões & Michael W. Caldwell. (2016). Re-characterization of Tylosaurus nepaeolicus (Cope, 1874) and Tylosaurus kansasensis Everhart, 2005: Ontogeny or sympatry? Cretaceous Research, It is likely that T. proriger evolved as a paedomorphic variety of T. nepaeolicus, retaining juvenile features into adulthood and attaining much larger adult size. A closely related genus, Hainosaurus, is known from the Cretaceous of North America and Europe. Both Tylosaurus and Hainosaurus are members of the group TylosaurinaeWilliston SW. 1898. Mosasaurs. The University Geological Survey of Kansas, Part V. 4: 81-347 (pls. 10-72). and are referred to informally as \\"tylosaurines\\" or \\"tylosaurs.\\" Research published in 2016, however, indicates that Hainosaurus is likely congeneric with Tylosaurus. BellBell GL. Jr. 1997. A phylogenetic revision of North American and Adriatic Mosasauroidea. pp. 293-332 In: Callaway J. M. and E. L Nicholls, (eds.), Ancient Marine Reptiles, Academic Press, 501 pages. placed the tylosaurines together with the plioplatecarpine mosasaurs (Platecarpus, Plioplatecarpus, etc.) in an informal monophyletic grouping which he called the \\"Russellosaurinae.\\" The cladogram is modified from a phylogenetic analysis by Jiménez-Huidobro & Caldwell (2019) using Tylosaurus species with sufficiently known material to model accurate relationships.  Paleobiology  Growth = Konishi and colleagues in 2018 assigned specimen FHSM VP-14845, a small juvenile with an estimated skull length of , to Tylosaurus based on the proportions of the braincase and the arrangement of the teeth in the snout and on the palate. However, the specimen lacks the characteristic snout projection of other Tylosaurus, which is present in juveniles of T. nepaeolicus and T. proriger with skull lengths of . This suggests that Tylosaurus acquired the snout projection rapidly at an early stage in life, and also suggests that it did not develop due to sexual selection. Konishi and colleagues suggested a function in ramming prey, as employed by the modern orca. = Diet = Scales of T. proriger (KUVP-1075) Stomach contents associated with specimens of Tylosaurus proriger indicate that this mosasaur had a varied diet, including fish, sharks, smaller mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, and flightless diving birds such as Hesperornis. T. proriger by Charles R. Knight, 1899 The Talkeetna Mountains Hadrosaur was a hadrosaurid of indeterminate classification whose carcass appeared to have been deposited in a bathyal or outer shelf environment that later became Alaska's Matanuska Formation. Every element of its skeleton not found in a concretion bore many closely spaced oval conical depressions ranging in diameter from and deep. These depressions are probably bite marks. The depressions are not symmetrical enough for gastropod drill marks and are not shaped like sponge borings. None of the preserved fish fossils of the Matanuska Formation fit the size or geometry of the borings. The size and spacing and shape by contrast, however, closely resembles the teeth of Tylosaurus proriger. The apparent tooth marks are unlikely to have occurred before the carcass was washed out to sea since that would have punctured the body, preventing the buildup of bloating gases that allowed the carcass to drift out to sea in the first place. The distribution of bite marks corresponds inversely to the presence of flesh in the animal. For instance, lower limb bones sustained the most damage because there was the least amount of flesh shielding the bones at those locations. The concretions formed as the flesh chemically reacted to the seafloor on the largest parts of the animal where the scavenging mosasaur would be unable to fully wrap its jaws around the carcass. Bones pulled free from the carcass were buried in the mud and preserved in mudstone.  References  * Bell GL. Jr. 1997. Part IV: Mosasauridae - Introduction. pp. 281–292 In: Callaway J. M. and E.

Scelidosaurus lived during the Early Jurassic Period, during the Sinemurian to Pliensbachian stages around 191 million years ago. This genus and related genera at the time lived on the supercontinent Laurasia. Its fossils have been found near Charmouth in Dorset, England, and are known for their excellent preservation. Scelidosaurus has been called the earliest complete dinosaur.Norman, David (2001). \\"Scelidosaurus, the earliest complete dinosaur\\" in The Armored Dinosaurs, pp 3-24. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. .The same claim has been made for Compsognathus It is the most completely known dinosaur of the British Isles. Scelidosaurus is currently the only classified dinosaur found in Ireland. Despite this, a modern description only materialised in 2019. After initial finds in the 1850s, comparative anatomist Richard Owen named and described Scelidosaurus in 1859. Only one species, Scelidosaurus harrisonii named by Owen in 1861, is considered valid today, although one other species was proposed in 1996. Scelidosaurus was about long. It was a largely quadrupedal animal, feeding on low scrubby plants, the parts of which were bitten off by the small, elongated head to be processed in the large gut. Scelidosaurus was lightly armoured, protected by long horizontal rows of keeled oval scutes that stretched along the neck, back and tail. One of the oldest known and most \\"primitive\\" of the thyreophorans, the exact placement of Scelidosaurus within this group has been the subject of debate for nearly 150 years. This was not helped by the limited additional knowledge about the early evolution of armoured dinosaurs. Today most evidence indicates that Scelidosaurus is the sister taxon to the two main clades of Thyreophora, the Stegosauria and Ankylosauria. DescriptionSize and posture= Size comparison A full-grown Scelidosaurus was rather small compared to most later non-avian dinosaurs, but it was a medium-sized species in the Early Jurassic. Some scientists have estimated a length of 4 metres (13 ft). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave a body length of 3.8 metres (12.5 ft) and a weight of 270 kilogrammes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 217 Scelidosaurus was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up on its hind legs to browse on foliage from trees, but its arms were relatively long, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture. A trackway from the Holy Cross Mountains of Poland shows a scelidosaur like animal walking in a bipedal manner, hinting that Scelidosaurus may have been more proficient at bipedalism than previously thought. =Distinguishing traits= The first modern diagnosis was provided by David Bruce Norman in 2019. In a first article, Norman provided autapomorphies, unique derived characters, of the skull. The front snout bones, the premaxillae, have a common central rough extension, in life bearing a small upper beak. The nasal bone has on its upper outside a facet touching the inner side of the ascending branch of the premaxilla. The antorbital fenestra is present as a bean-shaped depression, its lower edge formed by a sharp ridge. The central parietal crest on the skull roof is formed by two parallel crests separated by a narrow trough on the midline. The roof of the nasal cavity is formed by special plates above the vomers, called the \\"epivomers\\". The epipterygoid bone is shaped as a small conical vertical structure of which the base connects to the upper side of the pterygoid bone by means of a lateral flat surface. The basioccipital has large oblique facets on the lower sides. The opisthotic has an expanded pedicel with facets on its underside. Elongated epistyloid bones project obliquely to the rear and below, from the back of the skull. A small spur-like structure on the upper edge of the paroccipital process encases the posttemporal fenestra. The rear of the skull is fused on its upper edge with a pair of large curved horn- shaped osteoderms. The lower jaw shows only little exostosis, limited to the angular, and lacking an attached osteoderm. =Skull= Skull cast of BRSMG LEGL 0004 with the snout and lower jaw restored The head of Scelidosaurus was small, about twenty centimetres long, and elongated. The skull was low in side view and triangular in top view, longer than it was wide, similar to that of earlier ornithischians. The snout, largely formed by the nasal bones, was flat on top. Scelidosaurus still had the five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) seen in basal ornithischians: apart from the nostrils and eye sockets which are present in all basal dinosaurs, the fenestra antorbitalis and the upper and lower temporal fenestrae were not closed or overgrown, as with many later armoured forms. In fact, the upper temporal fenestrae were very large, forming conspicuous round openings in the top of the rear skull, serving as attachment areas for the powerful muscles that closed the lower jaws. The eye socket was slightly overshadowed in its front part by a brow ridge that has been seen as the prefrontal bone. In 2019, Norman concluded that it was a fused palpebral bone. Behind it, the upper rim of the eye socket was formed by the supraorbital bone. A study by Susannah Maidment e.a. concluded that juvenile specimens show that this bone was a fusion of three elements, one in front, the next in rear, and the third at the inner side.Maidment, S.C.R., Porro, L.B., 2010, \\"Homology of the palpebral and origin of the supraorbital ossifications in ornithischian dinosaurs\\", Lethaia, 43: 95-111 The premaxilla, the bone forming the snout tip, was short and no predentary, the bone core of the lower beak on the tip of the stout lower jaws, has been found, so the horny beak that is assumed present with all ornithischians was likely very short. Its teeth were longer and more triangular in side view than in later armoured dinosaurs. There were at least five teeth in each premaxilla, and at least nineteen in the maxilla and sixteen in the dentary of the lower jaw. However, the number of maxillary and dentary teeth were established with the incomplete skull of one of the first specimens found; the actual numbers might have ranged up to about two dozen, perhaps twenty-six for the lower jaw. The premaxillary teeth were somewhat longer and recurved. To the rear, they gradually approach the form of the maxillary teeth, beginning to show denticles. The crowns of the maxillary and dentary teeth have denticles on their edges and a swollen basis The ascending branches of the paired premaxillae notched the combined nasal bones, whereas the opposite was usual in ornithischians. The frontal bones were covered by a halo of fine ridges; these indicate the presence of ceratinous plates, as with modern turtles. At the front of the braincase, paired hatchet-shaped ossified orbitosphenoids formed the floor of the olfactory lobes of the brain. The skull of the neotype was damaged by a paleoichthyologist resulting in the detachment of triangular plates from the palate. These elements had been sketched by Norman in the seventies prior to the incident and interpreted as parts of the pterygoids, but in 2019 he concluded that they were special bones covering the roof of the nasal cavity, which he named the \\"epivomers\\". These are not known from any other animal. =Postcranial skeleton= Thorax of the neotype. The vertebral column of Scelidosaurus contained at least six neck vertebrae, seventeen dorsal vertebrae, four sacral vertebrae and at least thirty-five tail vertebrae. Though perhaps the actual total of cervical vertebrae was as high as seven or eight, the neck was only moderately long. The torso was relatively flat in side view, however, despite the belly being broad, it was not extremely vertically compressed as with ankylosaurs but taller than wide. The last three dorsal vertebrae had no ribs. The spines of the sacral vertebrae touched each other but were not fused into a supraneural plate. The quickly tapering tail was relatively short, probably representing about half of body length. The tail chevrons were strongly inclined to the rear. The hip area and tail base were stiffened by large numbers of ossified tendons. Leg of S. harrisonii The scapula was short with a moderately expanded upper end. The coracoid was circular in side view. The elements of the forelimb were generally moderately long, straight and stout. The hand is only known from recent discoveries and has not yet been described. In the rather wide pelvis, the ilium was straight in side view. Its front blade was rod-shaped and moderately splayed to the outside, creating room for the belly. This was reinforced by the sacral ribs becoming longer towards the front. The sacral ribs were wider at their attachment areas with the ilium, but were not fused into a sacral yoke. The pubis featured a short prepubis. The pubis shaft was straight, running parallel to a straight ischium shaft that was transversely flattened at its lower end. The thighbone was straight in side view, in front view it was somewhat bowed to the outside. Its head was not separated from the shaft by a real neck. While the major trochanter was at about the same level as the head, the lower minor trochanter was separated from both by a deep cleft. At it rear side, the femur mid-shaft featured a well-developed drooping fourth trochanter, a process for the attachment of the retractor tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis longus. The lower leg was somewhat shorter than the thighbone. The tibia had a wide upper end, with a cnemial crest protruding well to the front. The tibia lower end was also robust and rotated about 70° compared to the upper part, turning the foot strongly to the outside. The foot was very large and wide. The fifth metatarsal was only rudimentary but the other four were robust. Scelidosaurus had four large toes, with the innermost digit being the smallest. The fourth metatarsal was short but its toe was long and built to be splayed to the outside of the foot, to improve the stability. The claws were flat, hoof-shaped and curved to the inside. =Armour= Cast of a nearly complete skeleton found in 2000 by David Sole, showing fossilised bony scutes, Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre. The most obvious feature of Scelidosaurus is its armour, consisting of bony scutes embedded in the skin. These osteoderms were arranged in horizontal parallel rows down the animal's body. Osteoderms are today found in the skin of crocodiles, armadillos and some lizards. The osteoderms of Scelidosaurus ranged in both size and shape. Most were smaller or larger oval plates with a high keel on the outside, the highest point of the keel positioned more to the rear. Some scutes were small, flat and hollowed-out at the inside. The larger keeled scutes were aligned in regular horizontal rows. There were three rows of these along each side of the torso. The scutes of the lowest, lateral, row were more conical, rather than the blade-like osteoderms of Scutellosaurus.Martill, D.M., Batten, D.J., and Loydell, D.K. (2000). A New Specimen of the Thyreophoran Dinosaur cf. Scelidosaurus with Soft Tissue Preservation. Palaeontology, Vol. 43, Part 3, 2000, pp. 549-559. Between these main series, one or two rows of smaller oval keeled scutes were present. There were in total four rows of large scutes on the tail: one at the top midline, one at the midline of the underside, and one at each tail side. Whether the midline tail scutes continued over the torso and neck to the front is unknown and unlikely for the neck, though Scelidosaurus is often pictured this way. Restoration showing bipedal posture, as indicated by a fossil trackway The neck had at each side two rows of large scutes. The osteoderms of the lower neck row were very large, flat and plate- like. The first osteoderms of the top neck rows formed a pair of unique three- pointed scutes directly behind the head. These points seem to have been connected by tendons to the rear joint processes, the postzygapophyses, of the axis vertebra. In general the scutes were larger at the front of the torso, the osteoderms diminishing towards the rear, especially on the surface of the thighs. The smallest flat round scutes might have filled the room between the larger osteoderm rows. Perhaps a row of vertical osteoderms was present on the upper arms. Compared to the later Ankylosauria, Scelidosaurus was lightly armoured, without continuous plating, spikes or pelvic shield. Rough areas on the skull and lower jaws indicate the presence of skin ossifications. Some of the latest specimens found show partly different osteoderms including scutes on which the keel is more like a thorn or spike. These specimens also seem to have little horns on the rear corners of the head, placed on the squamosal bones. Fossilized skin impressions have also been found. Between the bony scutes, Scelidosaurus had rounded non-overlapping scales like the present Gila monster.Lambert D (1993). The Ultimate Dinosaur Book. Dorling Kindersley, New York, 110-113. Between the large scutes, very small (5-10 millimetres [0.2-0.4 in]) flat \\"granules\\" of bone were perhaps distributed within the skin. In the later Ankylosauria, these small scutes may have developed into larger scutes, fusing into the multi-osteodermal plate armour seen in genera such as Ankylosaurus. History of discovery Lithograph of the partial neotype skull. During the 1850s, quarry owner James Harrison of Charmouth, West Dorset of England found fossils from the cliffs of Black Ven between Charmouth and Lyme Regis, that were quarried, possibly for raw material for the manufacture of cement. Some of these he gave to the collector and retired general surgeon Henry Norris. In 1858, Norris and Harrison sent some fragmentary limb bones to Professor Richard Owen of the British Museum (Natural History), London (today the Natural History Museum). Among them was a left thighbone, specimen GSM 109560. In 1859, Owen named the genus Scelidosaurus in an entry about palaeontology in the Encyclopædia Britannica.Owen, R., 1859, \\"Palaeontology\\", In: Encyclopædia Britannica Edition 8, Volume 17, p. 150 The lemma text contained a diagnosis, implicating that the genus was validly named and was not a nomen nudum, despite the fact that the definition was vague and no specimens were identified.Charig, A.J. & Newman, B.H.†, 1992, \\"Scelidosaurus harrisonii Owen, 1861 (Reptilia, Ornithischia): proposed replacement in inappropriate lectotype\\", Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature, 49: 280–283 Owen intended to call the dinosaur \\"hindlimb saurian\\" but confused the Greek word σκέλος, skelos, \\"hindlimb\\", with σκελίς, skelis, \\"rib of beef\\".R. Owen, 1861, A monograph of a fossil dinosaur (Scelidosaurus harrisonii, Owen) of the Lower Lias, part I. Monographs on the British fossil Reptilia from the Oolitic Formations 1 pp 14George C. Steyskal, 1970, \\"On the grammar of names formed with -scelus, -sceles, -scelis, etc.\\", Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington 84(2): 7-12 The name was inspired by the strong development of the hind leg. Afterwards Harrison sent a knee joint, a claw (GSM 109561), a juvenile specimen and a skull to Owen, that were described in 1861. On that occasion the type species Scelidosaurus harrisonii was named, the specific name honouring Harrison. The skull later was revealed to be part of a nearly complete skeleton, that was described by Owen in 1863.R. Owen, 1863, A monograph of the fossil Reptilia of the Liassic Formations. Part 2. A monograph of a fossil dinosaur (Scelidosaurus harrisonii Owen) of the Lower Lias. Palaeontographical Society Monographs. Part 2. pp. 1-26 British palaeontologist David Bruce Norman has stressed how remarkable it is that Owen, who previously had propounded that dinosaurs were active quadrupedal animals, largely neglected Scelidosaurus though it could serve as a prime example of this hypothesis and its fossil was one of the most complete dinosaurs found at that time. Norman explained this by Owen's excessive workload in this period, including several administrative functions, polemics with fellow-scientists and the study of a large number of even more interesting newly discovered extinct animals, such as Archaeopteryx.Norman, D.B., 2000, \\"Professor Richard Owen and the important but neglected dinosaur Scelidosaurus harrisonii\\", Historical Biology, 14: 235–253 Norman also pointed out that Owen in 1861 suggested a lifestyle for Scelidosaurus that is very different from present ideas: it would have been a fish-eater and partially sea-dwelling. BMNH 39496, the first lectotype of Scelidosaurus, that proved to be a theropod instead. Owen had not indicated a holotype. In 1888, Richard Lydekker while cataloguing the BMNH fossils, designated some of the hindlimb fragments described in 1861, specimen BMNH 39496 consisting of a lower part of a femur and an upper part of the tibia and fibula, together forming a knee joint, as the type specimen, hereby implicitly choosing them as the lectotype of Scelidosaurus. Lydekker gave no reason for this choice;Lydekker, R., 1888, Catalogue of the Fossil Reptilia and Amphibia in the British Museum. Part 1. Containing the Orders Ornithosauria, Crocodilia, Dinosauria, Squamata, Rhynchocephalia and Proterosauria. British Museum (Natural History) perhaps he was motivated by their larger size. Unfortunately, mixed in with the Scelidosaurus fossils had been the partial remains of a theropod dinosaur and the femur and tibia thus belonged to such a carnivore; this was not discovered until 1968 by Bernard Newman.Newman, B.H. (1968) The Jurassic dinosaur Scelidosaurus harrisoni, Owen. Palaeontology 11 (1), 40-3. The same year, B. H. Newman suggested to have Lydekker's selection of the knee joint as the lectotype officially rescinded by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, as the joint was in his opinion from a species related to Megalosaurus. Eventually, after Newman had already died, Alan Jack Charig actually filed a request in 1992. In 1994 the ICZN reacted positively, in Opinion 1788 deciding that the skull and skeleton, specimen BMNH R.1111, would be the neotype of Scelidosaurus.International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, 1994, \\"Scelidosaurus harrisonii Owen, 1861 (Reptilia, Ornithischia): lectotype replaced\\", Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature 51: 288 The knee joint was in 1995 by Samuel Welles et al. informally assigned to a \\"Merosaurus\\", which name has not yet been validly published.Pickering, S., 1995, Jurassic Park: Unauthorized Jewish Fractals in Philopatry. A Fractal Scaling in Dinosaurology Project, 2nd revised printing. Capitola, California. 478 pp It more likely belongs to some member of the Coelophysoidea or Neoceratosauria. It has also been established by Newman and confirmed by Roger Benson that the original left thigbone, GSM 109560, belonged to a theropod.Benson, R., 2010, \\"The osteology of Magnosaurus nethercombensis (Dinosauria, Theropoda) from the Bajocian (Middle Jurassic) of the United Kingdom and a re-examination of the oldest records of tetanurans\\", Journal of Systematic Palaeontology 8(1): 131-146 Restoration of the skeleton by O.C. Marsh, showing the long legs at the time presumed for Scelidosaurus The neotype skeleton had been uncovered in the Black Ven Marl or Woodstone Nodule Bed, marine deposits of the Charmouth Mudstone Formation, dating from the late Sinemurian stage, about 191 million years ago.Barrett, P.M. and Maidment, S.C.R., 2011, \\"Dinosaurs of Dorset: Part III, the ornithischian dinosaurs (Dinosauria, Ornithischia) with additional comments on the sauropods\\", Proceedings of the Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society 132: 145–163 It consists of a rather complete skeleton with skull and lower jaws. Only the snout tip, the neck base, the forelimbs and the tail end are missing. Hundreds of osteoderms were found in connection with the skeleton, many more or less in their original position. From the 1960s onward, this fossil was further prepared by Ronald Croucher using acid baths to free the bones from the surrounding matrix, a method perfected for the Charmouth fossils. In 1992, Charig reported that only a single block had yet to be treated, but he died before the results could be published. Norman, who intended to complete this task, had revealed some new anatomical details in 2004. Apart from these, a modern description was largely lacking. In 2019, Norman published articles on the skull and the postcrania, also taking later finds into account. It transpired that the acid baths had, through leakages, severely deteriorated the condition of the bones, further mishandling leading to breakage and crumbling.Norman, D.B. 2019. \\"Scelidosaurus harrisonii from the Early Jurassic of Dorset, England: cranial anatomy\\". Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. doi:10.1093/zoolinnean/zlz074 Philpot's specimen Apart from the neotype, other fossils are known of Scelidosaurus. In 1888 Lydekker catalogued a large number of single bones, largely limb elements, and osteoderms, that had been acquired by the BMNH from the Norris collection. Owen in 1861 described a second, partial, skeleton of a juvenile animal, that later was added to the collection of Elizabeth Philpot and today is registered in the Lyme Regis Museum as specimen LYMPH 1997.37.4-10. As it was relatively large, Owen speculated, in the context of its presumed marine lifestyle, that Scelidosaurus might have been ovoviviparous. The short prepubis in this specimen convinced scientists that this process did not represent the main pubic body as some had thought, who had been unable to believe that the thin, backward-pointing, pubis with the Ornithischia was homologous to the forward- pointing much larger pubic bone in most reptilian groups. In more recent times, new discoveries have been made at Charmouth, not through commercial quarrying but by the efforts of amateur palaeontologists. In 1968 a second partial juvenile skeleton was described, specimen BMNH R6704,Rixon, A.E., 1968, \\"The development of the remains of a small Scelidosaurus from a Lias nodule\\", Museums Journal, 67: 315–321 that had already been reported in 1959.Delair, J.B., 1959, \\"The Mesozoic reptiles of Dorset: Part Two\\", Proceedings of the Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society, for 1958 80: 52-90 Found by geologist James Frederick Jackson (1894-1966) of Charmouth, it is from a slightly younger layer, the Stonebarrow Marl Member dating to the early Pliensbachian, about 190 million years old. In 1985 Simon Barnsley, David Costain and Peter Langham excavated a partial skeleton including a very complete skull and skin impressions,Ensom, P.C., 1989, \\"New scelidosaur remains from the Lower Lias of Dorset\\", Proceedings of the Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society 110: 165 & 167 which was sold to the Bristol Museum where it is registered as specimen BRSMG CE12785. Specimen CAMSMX.39256 is part of the collection of the Sedgwick Museum at Cambridge. Several specimens remain undescribed because they are in private collections. These include a 3.1 metres (ten feet) long skeleton found by David Sole in 2000, perhaps the most complete non-avian dinosaur exemplar ever discovered in the British Isles. All elements of the skeleton are now known. The finds by Sole differ from the neotype in details of the armour and might represent a separate taxon or reflect sexual dimorphism.Naish, D. & Martill, D.M., 2007, \\"Dinosaurs of Great Britain and the role of the Geological Society of London in their discovery: basal Dinosauria and Saurischia\\", Journal of the Geological Society, London, 164: 493–510 In 2019, Norman denied this. =Species= Skeleton of a young specimen, Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery Scelidosaurus harrisonii, named and described by Owen, is currently the only recognized species, based on several nearly complete skeletons. A potential second species from the Sinemurian-age Lower Lufeng Formation, Scelidosaurus oehleri, was described by David Jay Simmons in 1965 under its own genus, Tatisaurus. In 1996 Spencer G.

(ed.), The Continental Jurassic. Museum of Northern Arizona Bulletin 60. Although the fossils are fragmentary, this reassessment has not been accepted, and S. oehleri is today once again recognized as Tatisaurus. In 1989, scutes which were found in the Kayenta Formation (Glen Canyon Group) of northern Arizona, were by Kevin Padian referred to a Scelidosaurus sp., and used to determine that the age of the strata was around 199.6-196.5 million years ago, at a time when it was still thought that Scelidosaurus harrisonii dated to the early Sinemurian.Padian, K. (1989). \\"Presence of the dinosaur Scelidosaurus indicates Jurassic age for the Kayenta Formation (Glen Canyon Group, northern Arizona)\\". Geology. May 1989, v. 17; no. 5; p. 438-441 These scutes established a geographic tie-in between Arizona's Glen Canyon and Europe, where fossils of Scelidosaurus had previously been discovered. Later scientists have rejected the assignment to Scelidosaurus, as the scutes are different in form. In 2014, Roman Ulansky named a new species, S. arizonenesis, based on these specimens.Ulansky, R. E., 2014. Evolution of the stegosaurs (Dinosauria; Ornithischia). Dinologia, 35 pp. [in Russian]. [DOWNLOAD PDF] http://dinoweb.narod.ru/Ulansky_2014_Stegosaurs_evolution.pdf. In 2016, Peter Malcolm Galton and Kenneth Carpenter identified it as a nomen dubium, instead once again placing the specimens as Thyreophora indet.Galton, Peter M. & Carpenter, Kenneth, 2016, \\"The plated dinosaur Stegosaurus longispinus Gilmore, 1914 (Dinosauria: Ornithischia; Upper Jurassic, western USA), type species of Alcovasaurus n. gen.\\", Neues Jahrbuch für Geologie und Paläontologie - Abhandlungen 279(2): 185-208 In 2000, David Martill et al. announced the preservation of soft tissue in a specimen referred to a cf. Scelidosaurus sp., that is, an unnamed species for which a comparison with Scelidosaurus can be illuminating. The fossil, with inventory number BRSMG CF2781, was in the early 1990s, in an already prepared state, discovered in the legacy of the late Professor John Challinor, which had used it to illustrate his lectures with. Its provenance is unknown. It consists of a series of eight caudal vertebrae in a cut slab of carbonate mudstone, which was judged to date from the late Hettangian to Sinemurian stages. Parts of the fossil were preserved in such a way that an envelope of preserved soft tissue is visible around the vertebrae, and show the presence of an epidermal layer over the scutes. The authors concluded that the osteoderms of all basal armoured dinosaurs were covered in a tough, probably keratinous layer of skin. Classification and phylogeny Dorsal vertebrae. Sacrum and iliac bone. Scelidosaurus was placed in the Dinosauria by Owen in 1861. In 1868/1869 Edward Drinker Cope proposed a family Scelidosauridae in a double lecture but this was only published in December 1871;E.D. Cope, 1871, Synopsis of the extinct Batrachia, Reptilia and Aves of North America. Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, New Series 14, pp 252 therefore it was Thomas Henry Huxley who validly named the Scelidosauridae in 1869.Huxley, T.H. 1869. \\"On the Dinosauria of the Trias, with observations on the classification of the Dinosauria\\", Nature, 1: 146 In the nineteenth century almost any armoured dinosaur then known has been considered a member of the Scelidosauridae. In the later twentieth century, the term was used for an assembly of \\"primitive\\" ornithischians close to the ancestry of ankylosaurs and stegosaurs, such as Scutellosaurus, Emausaurus, Lusitanosaurus and Tatisaurus. Today, paleontologists usually consider the Scelidosauridae paraphyletic, thus not forming a separate branch or clade; however, Benton (2004) lists the group as monophyletic.Benton, M.J. (2004). Vertebrate Palaeontology (Third ed.). Blackwell Publishing. The family was resurrected by Chinese paleontologist Dong Zhiming in his 2001 description of Bienosaurus, a thyreophoran sharing close affinities with Scelidosaurus. Scelidosaurus was an ornithischian. It was the oldest ornithischian known until the description of Geranosaurus in 1911. During the twentieth century, it has been classified at different times as an ankylosaur or stegosaur. Alfred von Zittel (1902), William Elgin Swinton (1934), and Robert Appleby et al. (1967) identified the genus as a stegosaurian,Thulborn, R.A. (1977) Relationships of the lower Jurassic dinosaur Scelidosaurus harrisonii. Journal of Paleontology. July 1977; v. 51; no. 4; p. 725-739 though this concept then encompassed all armoured forms. In a 1968 paper, Romer argued it was an ankylosaur. In 1977, Richard Thulborn of the University of Queensland attempted to reclassify Scelidosaurus as an ornithopod similar to Tenontosaurus or Iguanodon. Thulborn argued Scelidosaurus was a lightly built bipedal dinosaur adapted for running. Thulborn's 1977 theories on the genus have since been rejected. This debate is still ongoing; at this time, Scelidosaurus is considered to be either more closely related to ankylosaurids than to stegosaurids and, by extension, a true ankylosaur,Kazlev, M. Alan (2007). \\"Ornithischia: Ankylosauromorpha\\" Palaeos. Retrieved on 2007-02-11. or basal to the ankylosaur-stegosaur split. The stegosaur classification has fallen out of favor, but is seen in older dinosaur books. Cladistic analyses have invariably recovered a basal position for Scelidosaurus, outside of the Eurypoda. The position of Scelidosaurus according to a cladistic study of 2011 is shown by this cladogram:Richard S. Thompson, Jolyon C. Parish, Susannah C. R. Maidment and Paul M. Barrett, 2011, \\"Phylogeny of the ankylosaurian dinosaurs (Ornithischia: Thyreophora)\\", Journal of Systematic Palaeontology 10(2): 301–312 Fossil records of thyreophorans more basal than Scelidosaurus are sparse. The more \\"primitive\\" Scutellosaurus, also found in Arizona, was an earlier genus which was facultatively bipedal. A trackway of a possible early armoured dinosaur, from around 195 million years ago, has been found in France.Le Loeuff, J., Lockley, M., Meyer, C., and Petit, J.-P. (1999). Discovery of a thyreophoran trackway in the Hettangian of central France. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris 2 328, 215-219 Ancestors of these basal thyreophorans evolved from early ornithischians similar to Lesothosaurus during the Late Triassic. Paleobiology Close up of tooth, and left side of the neotype skull. =Diet= Like most other thyreophorans, Scelidosaurus is known to be herbivorous. However, while some later ornithischian groups possessed teeth capable of grinding plant material, Scelidosaurus had smaller, less complex leaf-shaped teeth suitable for cropping vegetation and jaws capable of only vertical movement, due to a short jaw joint. Paul Barrett concluded that Scelidosaurus fed with a puncture-crush system of tooth-on-tooth action, with a precise but simple up-and-down jaw movement, in which the food was mashed between the inner side of the upper teeth and the outer side of the lower teeth, without the teeth actually touching each other as shown by very long vertical wear facets on the lower teeth alone. In this aspect, it resembled the stegosaurids, which also bore primitive teeth and simple jaws. Its diet would have consisted of ferns or conifers, as grasses did not evolve until late into the Cretaceous Period, after Scelidosaurus was long extinct. Another similarity with the stegosaurs is the narrow head, which might indicate a selective diet consisting of high- quality fodder. However, Barrett pointed out that for an animal the size of Scelidosaurus, with a large gut allowing efficient fermentation, the intake of easily digestible food of high energetic value was less important than with smaller animals, that are often critically dependent on it. Norman concluded that Scelidosaurus fed on low scrubby vegetation, with a height up to one metre. Raising itself on its hindlimbs alone, could have vertically increased the feeding envelope and was perhaps anatomically possible, but Norman doubted it was a relevant part of its behaviour.

It was named by paleontologist Richard Owen in 1859. Dimorphodon means \\"two-form tooth\\", derived from the Greek (') meaning \\"two\\", (') meaning \\"shape\\" and (') meaning \\"tooth\\", referring to the fact that it had two distinct types of teeth in its jaws – which is comparatively rare among reptiles. Description Restoration of a pair of D. macronyx The body structure of Dimorphodon displays many \\"primitive\\" characteristics, such as, according to Owen, a very small brain-pan and proportionally short wings. The first phalanx in its flight finger is only slightly longer than its lower arm. The neck was short but strong and flexible and may have had a membranous pouch on the underside. The vertebrae had pneumatic foramina, openings through which the air sacs could reach the hollow interior. Dimorphodon had an adult body length of 1 metre (3.3 ft) long, with a 1.45 metre (4.6 ft) wingspan. The tail of Dimorphodon was long and consisted of thirty vertebrae. The first five or six were short and flexible, but the remainder gradually increased in length and were stiffened by elongated vertebral processes. The terminal end of the tail may have borne a Rhamphorhynchus-like tail vane, although no impressions have yet been found in Dimorphodon fossils to confirm this speculation. =Skull= Dimorphodon had a large, bulky skull approximately 23 centimetres in length, whose weight was reduced by large openings separated from each other by thin bony partitions. Its structure, reminiscent of the supporting arches of a bridge, prompted Richard Owen to declare that, as far as achieving great strength from lightweight materials was concerned, no vertebra was more economically constructed; Owen saw the vertebrate skull as a combination of four vertebrae modified from the ideal type of the vertebra.Padian.

The Illustrated Directory of Dinosaurs and Other Prehistoric Creatures. London: Salamander Books, Ltd. Pp. 288-291. Many depictions give it a speculative puffin-like 'beak' because of similarities between the two animals' skulls. History of discovery D. macronyx holotype specimen, NHMUK PV R 1034 The first fossil remains now attributed to Dimorphodon were found in England by fossil collector Mary Anning, at Lyme Regis in Dorset, UK in December 1828. This region of Britain is now a World Heritage Site, dubbed the Jurassic Coast; in it layers of the Blue Lias are exposed, dating from the Hettangian-Sinemurian. The specimen was acquired by William Buckland and reported in a meeting of the Geological Society on 5 February 1829.Buckland, W. (1829). Proceedings of the Geological Society of London, 1: 127 In 1835, after a thorough study by William Clift and William John Broderip, this report, strongly expanded, was published in the Transactions of the Geological Society, describing and naming the fossil as a new species. As was the case with most early pterosaur finds, Buckland classified the remains in the genus Pterodactylus, coining the new species Pterodactylus macronyx.Buckland, W. (1835). \\"On the discovery of a new species of Pterodactyle in the Lias at Lyme Regis.\\" Transactions of the Geological Society of London, series 23: 217-222. The specific name is derived from Greek makros, \\"large\\" and onyx, \\"claw\\", in reference to the large claws of the hand. The specimen, presently NHMUK PV R 1034, consisted of a partial and disarticulated skeleton on a slab, lacking the skull. Buckland in 1835 also assigned a piece of jaw from the collection of Elizabeth Philpot to P. macronyx. Later, the many putative species assigned to Pterodactylus had become so anatomically diverse that they began to be broken into separate genera. Illustration of D. macronyx specimen NHUK PV R 1035 In 1858, Richard Owen reported finding two new specimens, NHMUK PV OR 41212 and NHMUK PV R 1035, again partial skeletons but this time including the skulls. Having found the skull to be very different from that of Pterodactylus, Owen assigned Pterodactylus macronyx its own genus, which he named Dimorphodon.Owen, R. (1859). \\"On a new genus (Dimorphodon) of pterodactyle, with remarks on the geological distribution of flying reptiles.\\" Rep. Br. Ass. Advmnt Sci., 28 (1858): 97–103. His first report contained no description and the name remained a nomen nudum. In 1859, however, a subsequent publication by Owen provided a description.Owen, R. (1857/1859). \\"On the vertebral characters of the order Pterosauria (Ow.), as exemplified in the genera Pterodactylus (Cuv.) and Dimorphodon (Ow.)\\", Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, 9: 703-704 After several studies highlighting aspects of Dimorphodon 's anatomy, Owen in 1874 made NHMUK PV R 1034 the holotype.Owen, R.

Pterosauria\\", Palaeontographical Society of London, 27: 1-14 Cast of D. macronyx specimen NHMUK PV OR 41212 Meanwhile, though Dimorphodon is not a very common fossil, other fragmentary specimens were found. Some of these were acquired by Othniel Charles Marsh between 1873 and 1881 from the London fossil dealer Bryce McMurdo Wright. One of these had been recovered from early Jurassic strata at the south bank of the Severn river, at the Aust Cliff. An additional species of Dimorphodon, D. weintraubi, was named by James Clark et al in 1998 from a partial skeleton recovered in siltstones from the site Huizachal Canyon in La Boca Formation in Tamaulipas, Mexico, from the Early Jurassic (Pliensbachian), where remains of sphenodontians, dinosaurs and mammaliaforms have also been found .Marisol Montellano, James A. Hopson and James M. Clark (2008). Late Early Jurassic Mammaliaforms from Huizachal Canyon, Tamaulipas, México. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, Vol. 28, No. 4 (Dec. 12, 2008), pp. 1130-1143. It is known from the type specimen, IGM 3494 (Instituto Geológico de México, of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México), that comprises articulated pieces of the skeleton including the posterior part of skull, four cervical vertebrae, the scapulocoracoids, left humerus, partial right wing and right leg distal to mid tibiotarsus. This specimen is larger than D. macronyx and the well preserved foot of it shows that pterosaurs do not have a digitigrade posture in their hindlimbs, but that it have a plantigrade gait, as has been inferred from footprints. The name of the species is a homage to Dr. Robert L. Weintraub.J. M. Clark, J. A. Hopson, R. Hernández R., D. E. Fastovsky & M. Montellano (1998). Foot posture in a primitive pterosaur. Nature 391, 886-889 (26 February 1998). doi:10.1038/36092. Classification Reconstructed skeleton, Rainbow Forest Museum In 1870, Seeley assigned Dimorphodon to its own family, Dimorphodontidae, with Dimorphodon as the only member. It was suggested in 1991 by the German paleontologist Peter Wellnhofer that Dimorphodon might be descended from the earlier European pterosaur Peteinosaurus. Later exact cladistic analyses are not in agreement. According to Unwin, Dimorphodon was related to, though probably not a descendant of, Peteinosaurus, both forming the clade Dimorphodontidae, the most basal group of the Macronychoptera and within it the sister group of the Caelidracones. This would mean that both dimorphodontid species would be the most basal pterosaurs known with the exception of Preondactylus. According to Alexander Kellner, however, Dimorphodon is far less basal and not a close relative of Peteinosaurus. The cladogram recovered by Andres and Myers in 2013 is reproduced below. PalaeobiologyDiet= Restoration of D. macronyx chasing a sphenodontian on the ground The knowledge of how Dimorphodon lived is limited. It perhaps mainly inhabited coastal regions and might have had a very varied diet. Buckland suggested it ate insects. Later, it became common to depict it as a piscivore (fish eater), though Buckland's original idea is more well supported by biomechanical studies, and inconsistent with the animal's habits (see flight below). Dimorphodon had an advanced jaw musculature specialized for a \\"snap and hold\\" method of feeding. The jaw could close extremely quickly, but with relatively little force or tooth penetration. This, along with the short and high skull and longer, pointed front teeth suggest that Dimorphodon was an insectivore, though it may have occasionally eaten small vertebrates and carrion as well.Osi, A. (2010). \\"Feeding-related characters in basal pterosaurs: implications for jaw mechanism, dental function and diet.\\" Lethaia, Mark Witton has argued that the animal was a specialised carnivore, being too large for an insectivorous diet and therefore specialised to hunt small lizards, sphenodonts and mammals, though its relatively weak jaw musculature probably meant that it ate proportionally small prey. =Locomotion= Like many pterosaurs, Dimorphodon has been perceived as a soarer in the past, correlating to historical perceptions of pterosaurs as seabird analogues. However, more recent studies show that the animal was actually a rather poor flyer: its wings are proportionally short in relation to the body and its skeleton rather robust, offering very little gliding potential. In life, Dimorphodon probably relied on frantic short flights in the same manner as modern fowl, tinamous and woodpeckers, being unable to fly for long distances and probably only taking to the air as a last resort.Rayner et all 2011 Restoration of D. macronyx in flight Its derived position amidst primitive pterosaurs implies that this ineptitude is a developed trait, not an ancestral characteristic, as earlier pterosaurs like Preondactylus were capable aeronauts. D. macronyx in the controversial bipedal pose, Seeley, 1901 Seeley's quadrupedal Dimorphodon pose Owen saw Dimorphodon as a quadruped. He speculated that the fifth toe supported a membrane between the tail and the legs and that the animal was therefore very ungainly on the ground. However, his rival Harry Govier Seeley, propagating the view that pterosaurs were warm-blooded and active, argued that Dimorphodon was either an agile quadruped or even a running biped due to its relatively well developed hindlimbs and characteristics of its pelvis.Seeley, H. G. (1870). \\"Remarks on Prof. Owen's Monograph on Dimorphodon\\", Annals and Magazine of Natural History, Series 4, 6:129 This hypothesis was revived by Kevin Padian in 1983.Padian, K. (1983). \\"Osteology and functional morphology of Dimorphodon macronyx (Buckland) (Pterosauria: Rhamphorhynchoidea) based on new material in the Yale Peabody Museum\\", Postilla, 189: 1-44 However, fossilised track remains of other pterosaurs (ichnites) show a quadrupedal gait while on the ground and these traces are all attributed to derived pterosaurs with a short fifth toe. Dimorphodon's was elongated, clawless, and oriented to the side. David Unwin has therefore argued that even Dimorphodon was a quadruped, a view confirmed by computer modelling by Sarah Sangster.Sangster, S. (2001). \\"Anatomy, functional morphology and systematics of Dimorphodon\\", Strata 11: 87-88 Like most non-pterodactyloid pterosaurs, Dimorphodon was a competent climber, possessing proportionally large and curved ungals and a low center of gravity. Like modern squirrels, it probably moved in a saltatorial manner as it climbed.

Remains referred to Pelorosaurus date from the Early Cretaceous period, about 140-125 million years ago, and have been found in England and Portugal. Thomas Holtz estimated its length at 24 meters (79 feet). The name Pelorosaurus was one of the first to be given to any sauropod. Many species have been assigned to the genus historically, but most are currently considered to belong to other genera. Problematically, the first named species of Pelorosaurus, P. conybeari, is a junior synonym of Cetiosaurus brevis. History BMNH R28633, one of nine caudal vertebrae in 1853 referred by Owen to P. conybeari Pelorosaurus was the first sauropod to be identified as a dinosaur, although it was not the first to be discovered. Richard Owen had discovered Cetiosaurus in 1841 but had incorrectly identified it as a gigantic sea-going crocodile-like reptile. Mantell identified Pelorosaurus as a dinosaur, living on land. The taxonomic history of Pelorosaurus and Cetiosaurus, as noted by reviewers including Michael P. Taylor and Darren Naish, is highly confusing. In 1842, Richard Owen named several species of Cetiosaurus. Among them was Cetiosaurus brevis, based on several specimens from the early Cretaceous Period. Some of these, four caudal vertebrae, BMNH R2544–2547, and three chevrons, BMNH R2548–2550, found around 1825 by John Kingdon near Cuckfield in the Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation of the Hastings Beds, belonged to sauropods. Others however, including BMNH R10390, found near Sandown Bay on the Isle of Wight, and BMNH R2133 and R2115, found near Hastings, actually belonged to some iguanodont. Noticing Owen's mistake in assigning iguanodont bones to Cetiosaurus, comparative anatomist Alexander Melville renamed the sauropod bones Cetiosaurus conybeari in 1849. In 1850, Gideon Mantell decided that C. conybeari was so different from Cetiosaurus that it needed a new genus, so he reclassified it under the new name Pelorosaurus conybeari. Mantell had originally, in November 1849, intended to use the name \\"Colossosaurus\\", but upon discovering that kolossos was Greek for \\"statue\\" and not \\"giant\\", he changed his mind. The generic name is derived from the Greek pelor, \\"monster\\". He also emended the specific name (honouring William Conybeare) to conybearei, but under the present rules of the ICZN, the original conybeari, today written without a capital, has priority. Mantell not only used the sauropod material of C. brevis as the type of Pelorosaurus conybeari but also a large humerus found by miller Peter Fuller at the same site, BMNH 28626, which he assumed to have been of the same individual, being discovered only a few metres away from the vertebrae. Mantell acquired the bone for ₤8. The humerus, clearly shaped to vertically support the weight of the body and presumed to possess a medullary cavity, showed that Pelorosaurus was a land animal. This was a main motive in naming a separate genus; shortly afterwards, however, by studying the sacral vertebrae of Cetiosaurus Mantell established that it too lived on land. The caudal sauropod vertebrae that form the type specimen of C. brevis Owen was highly piqued by Melville's and Mantell's attempts to \\"suppress\\" his Cetiosaurus brevis. By a publication in 1853 he tried to set matters straight, as he saw it, while avoiding having to openly admit his original mistake. First he suggested that Melville's main motivation for the name change was the presumed inaccuracy of the epithet brevis, \\"short\\", because the total length of the animal could not be deduced from such limited remains. Owen pointed out that anyone being acquainted with taxonomy would have understood that \\"short\\" referred to the vertebrae themselves, not to the animal as a whole. On a subsequent page, apparently separate from this issue, Owen in covert terms implied that his 1842 publication was not descriptive enough, thus merely having resulted in a nomen nudum, to which he now assigned the sauropod material, making Cetiosaurus brevis a valid name. This still left the problem of it having been named a new genus by Mantell. Owen resolved it by simply presenting the humerus as the sole holotype of Pelorosaurus conybeari.Owen, R., 1853, Monograph on the fossil Reptilia of the Wealden and Purbeck formations, Palaeontological Society, London Remarkably, in 1859 he repeated his mistake by again referring iguanodontid vertebrae, specimens BMNH R1010 and R28635, to C. brevis.Owen, R., 1859, Monograph on the fossil Reptilia of the Wealden and Purbeck formations. Supplement no. II. Crocodilia (Streptospondylus, etc.). [Wealden.] The Palaeontographical Society, London 1857: 20-44 The last of these he had in 1853 proposed to belong to Pelorosaurus together with a number of other iguanodontid vertebrae because Mantell had once labelled them as such in his collection; Owen suggested it had been by a mere mistake that the name Pelorosaurus had been connected with the C. brevis material instead of with these finds. Fanciful 1914 restoration of Pelorosaurus by Vincent Lynch Owen's interpretation was commonly accepted until well into the twentieth century. By 1970 however, both John Ostrom and Rodney Steel understood that Owen's claim that C. brevis in 1842 was still a nomen nudum should be rejected as a transparent attempt to change the type specimen, inadmissible by present standards. By those same standards though, Melville's name change was also incorrect: as the name Cetiosaurus brevis was still \\"available\\" he should simply have made the sauropod bones the lectotype, removing the iguanodontid remains from the syntype series. The sauropod bones, not the iguanodont bones, would then have retained the name C. brevis. Therefore, Cetiosaurus conybeari is a junior objective synonym of C. brevis, that is, C. brevis is not only an older name, but one based on exactly the same fossils as the younger, invalid name. After 1850, more specimens continued to be assigned to both Pelorosaurus and Cetiosaurus, and both were studied and reported on extensively in the scientific literature. Slowly a tendency developed to subsume fragmentary sauropod material from the Jurassic of England under the designation Cetiosaurus, while assigning incomplete European Cretaceous sauropod finds to Pelorosaurus. Pelorosaurus thus came to be a typical wastebasket taxon for any European sauropod of this period. However, in recent years much work has been done to rectify the confusion. Classification The validity of Pelorosaurus is problematic. P. conybeari was based on a separately discovered humerus and vertebrae. However, these specimens might not belong to the same animal. P. conybeari is also a junior synonym of the older name Cetiosaurus brevis. In 2007, Michael P. Taylor and Darren Naish stated their intention to petition the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) in order to designate the more widely used name P. conybeari the type species of Pelorosaurus and officially abandon the name c. brevis. However, the issue of the Pelorosaurus type species did not end up as part of their petition when it was officially filed and accepted.International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. 2014. \\"OPINION 2331 (Case 3472): Cetiosaurus Owen, 1841 (Dinosauria, Sauropoda): usage conserved by designation of Cetiosaurus oxoniensis Phillips, 1871 as the type species\\".

One notable species, P. becklesii, was known from a humerus, radius and ulna, as well as skin impressions.

In 1852 Friedrich August Quenstedt formally listed it in the Dinosauria.Quenstedt, F.A., 1852, Handbuch der Petrefaktenkunde, 1st edition. H. Laupp'schen, Tübingen pp. 1-792 Predictably, Owen at first rejected this classification, still in 1859 considering it a member of the Crocodilia. In 1882 Henri-Émile Sauvage first stated it belonged to the Sauropoda. That group being still very incompletely known however, it proved difficult to determine its more precise affinities, with the Atlantosauridae, Cardiodontidae, Cetiosauridae and Morosauridae being suggested until in 1927 von Huene understood the possible link with Brachiosaurus, placing Pelorosaurus in the Brachiosauridae, a placement followed by subsequent authors until the early 21st century. The humerus, 137 centimeters long and very elongated, strongly suggests a typical brachiosaurid trait was present: the possession of relatively long front limbs. The uncertainties about whether the qualities of the vertebrae or the humerus should be analysed, both specimens not necessarily belonging to the same taxon, prevents any firm conclusion to be reached, however. In recent years, the material was commonly placed in a more general Titanosauriformes.

In 1788 he became a cornet, a junior cavalry officer, in the 8th regiment of dragoons. At the end of 1794 he sold his commission and went to Leiden to study Persian. Marriage and family life In 1798 he was in Crickhowell where he eventually would publish his Travels and have them locally printed. He had married Julia Frances Irving in 1796 and had a large number of children. The eldest was Sir William Gore Ouseley who was a diplomat in South America and a renowned artist. Knighted In 1800, Charles Lord Cornwallis (1738–1805), who from 1786 to 1793 had been Governor-General of India, had him knighted in recognition of his promotion of oriental studies.William Ouseley in Iranica on line accessed 15 September 2007 Published works In 1795 he published Persian Miscellanies; in 1797–1799, Oriental Collections; in 1799, Epitome of the Ancient History of Persia; in 1800, The Oriental Geography of Ebn Haukal (The Oriental Geography of Ibn Hawqal);and in 1801, a translation of the Bakhtiyar Nama and Observations on Some Medals and Gems.

Otmoor is primarily wetland and in winter provides a home to thousands of waterfowl. It is increasingly becoming a wintering ground for thousands of wildfowl and waders. Over a thousand wigeon and teal have been recorded, while birds of prey such as merlins and peregrines are regularly seen. Large areas of Otmoor have benefited from extensive agriculture using traditional methods, resulting in good numbers of songbirds that are otherwise declining in the UK, including bullfinch, skylark, reed bunting, grasshopper warbler and European turtle dove. Spring and autumn both produce good numbers of passage migrants, including waders in the spring and common redstarts and whinchats in the autumn. The best time for marsh harriers is late April to mid-May. There are good numbers of breeding waders and recent RSPB work has increased the number of pairs of northern lapwings and common redshanks. The site has become well known for murmurations (roosting displays) of starlings in winter. Bitterns were recorded as breeding in 2016. A diverse selection of other wildlife has been recorded at the reserve. Many rare plants have been reported from the area, including fen violet, downy-fruited sedge, dyer's greenweed, heath spotted orchid and green-winged orchid. The butterflies include three species of hairstreak: the black, brown and White-letter in the hedgerows, and in the meadows there are populations of marbled white and orange tip. Odonata include hairy dragonfly and variable damselfly. Mammals living on the reserve include the brown hare, European badger and Reeves's muntjac.

However it previously seems to have been a rampart built by the Jebusites prior to Jerusalem's being conquered by the Israelites.Blank, W., Bible Study – The Millo , accessed 9 October 2017 The texts also describe the Millo built by Solomon1 Kings 9:24 and repaired by Hezekiah,2 Chronicles 32:4–5 without giving an explanation of what exactly the Millo was: there is therefore some debate among scholars as to the Millo's specific nature. The most common assumption among archaeologists and historians of ancient Israel is that the Millo is the Stepped Stone Structure uncovered by Kathleen Kenyon and demonstrated by Eilat Mazar to be connected to a Large Stone Structure which she discovered in 2005. Hebrew Bible In the Books of Samuel, Millo is mentioned as the boundary of David's construction while building up the City of David after the capture of Jerusalem from the Jebusites.2 Samuel 5:9 The New King James Version identifies Millo as literally \\"The Landfill\\",2 Samuel 5:9 (NKJV) while the New International Version translates it to \\"supporting terraces\\".2 Samuel 5:9 (NIV) Kidron Valley viewed from the Old City of Jerusalem, with Millo (Area G) to the lower right. Hezekiah's repair of the Millo is mentioned within a list of repairs to military fortifications, and several scholars generally believe that it was something connected to military activity, such as a tower, citadel, or simply a significant part of a wall.Peake's Commentary on the BibleJewish Encyclopedia However, taking into account that the potentially cognate term mulu, from Assyrian, refers to earthworks,Jewish Encyclopedia it is considered more likely that it was an embankment which flattened the slope between Ophel and the Temple Mount.Peake's Commentary on the Bible Archeology A recent excavation by Eilat Mazar directly above the Stepped Stone Structure shows that the structure connects with and supports the Large Stone Structure.Mazar, Eilat, \\"Excavations at the Summit of the City of David, Preliminary Report of Seasons 2005–2007\\", Shoham, Jerusalem and New York, 2009. Mazar presents evidence that the Large Stone Structure was an Israelite royal palace in continuous use from the tenth century until 586 BC. Her conclusion that the stepped stone structure and the large stone structure are parts of a single, massive royal palace makes sense of the biblical reference to the millo as the House of Millo in and in as the place where King Joash was assassinated in 799 BC while he slept in his bed. Millo is derived from \\"fill\\", (Hebrew milui).

With the 603 - introduced along with the Zagato-built 412 - the Bristol car underwent its first major facelift since the introduction of the 406 in the late 1950s. The design was to last until the marque's (temporary?) demise in 2011. Bristol's chief designer Dudley Hobbs strived to make the car more spacious and aerodynamic, while also using flatter body panels that would be easier to hammer. 603 The classic three-box two-door saloon was replaced by a considerably more streamlined design with a much larger and more curved rear window. The manufacturer pointed out that the new car had more head, leg and shoulder room than any previous Bristol. The outdated style of door handle was updated. The original 603 was offered in two versions, largely owing to the energy crisis which increased fuel prices so that affordability of fuel was no longer a certainty for those who could afford such expensive cars. The 603E has a 5,211 cc V8 petrol engine, whereas the 603S had a larger 5.9-litre unit, from Chrysler. The 603 saw improvements over previous models in its fuel consumption, being able to achieve as much as at around compared with the 411's – for comparison, as good as the Jaguar XJS. Both retained the same transmission and suspension as the 411, but the cabin had become more luxurious with the provision of electrically adjustable seats and air conditioning.  603 S2 As the energy crisis eased, all Bristols received a standard 5.9-litre Chrysler unit that was to be used for all subsequent editions of the car. The headlamp clusters were also set in a new grille. This model is called the 603 S2.  Britannia and Brigand (603 S3) Bristol Brigand The third series of 603, introduced in 1982 and continuing until 1994, saw Bristol adopt for the first time the names of the famous Bristol Aeroplane Company models for its cars. With this series of 603, there was a smaller radiator grille and more modern rear vision mirrors. The headlamps were the rectangular units from the Volkswagen Scirocco II. The tail-lights, borrowed from the Bedford CF2 van, were also mounted directly vertically, whereas on previous versions of the 603 the reversing lights were separate from the rear turn indicators and brake lights. Bristol Britannia at Filton, England (2010). This model was produced from 1982 to 1994 and was replaced by the Bristol Blenheim. The Bristol Britannia was the standard version, whilst the Bristol Brigand had a Rotomeister turbocharger added to the Chrysler V8 engine and a torque converter originally used on the 440 V8 to cope with the extra performance, which saw the Brigand capable of 150 mph (241 km/h). The Brigand could be distinguished from the Britannia by the bulge in the bonnet needed to accommodate the turbocharger, and also had alloy wheels as standard equipment. There were a number of minor changes to the appearance of both models during their 12-year production run, especially at the front.  Blenheim (603 S4) Bristol Blenheim 3S, showing the Opel Senator taillights Bristol Blenheim 4S/G With the Blenheim, Bristol further refined the 603, in particular modernising the mechanicals of the car through the introduction of multi-port fuel injection, which improved both performance and fuel consumption. Turbocharging was no longer available, but the Blenheim Series 1 still had the same level of performance as the Brigand. There was a significant change in frontal and rear-end styling with the introduction of the Blenheim. The headlights were paired and mounted considerably inboard from the extreme front of the car. The bonnet was also modified with the fitting of gas struts to hold it up when open for the first time, and featured a fully rectangular hinge for the first time in Bristol's history. Since that time the Blenheim has gone through two additional series, the Bristol Blenheim Series 2, made from January 1998 to the end of 1999, featured for the first time a four-speed overdrive automatic transmission, which significantly improved fuel consumption. Bristol also responded to complaints about lacking power and reworked the engine, which now produced approximately . The front was reworked with larger headlamps and grille opening, accentuated by a single central chrome strip. The track was widened, while other modifications shrunk the rather large turning circle to . The Blenheim 3 which went on sale in 2000 (shown in October 1999) saw the abandonment of the vertically mounted Bedford tail-lights in favor of the split units from the Opel Senator B and a much revised interior layout with completely new gear selector and improved instrumentation. Also, the engine saw significant improvements: higher compression along with reworked camshafts, heads, and a new engine management system gave what Bristol referred to as \\"significantly increased\\" power. Period publications estimate it to . As of early 2002 there was also a sportier model with blacked out trim, called the Blenheim 3S. A new manifold and bigger valves, along with a reworked engine management system which allowed another 500 rpm of engine speed, meant that about was now on tap. Bristol themselves declined to offer official power figures, as usual, but simply stated that the engine provided \\"muscular authority.\\" The suspension was firmed up and aluminium wheels were fitted. Four-pot brakes were included up front and the rear track was widened by , which required the rear fenders to be reworked. At the rear end, four exhaust pipes were fitted. In the spring of 2009, Bristol finished a car referred to as the Blenheim 4S/G at the request of a customer. This revived the 603 body, albeit with the taillights of a 2000-2004 Audi A4 Avant (B6), and with new doorhandles replacing the usual Vauxhall units. It is not immediately apparent, but every single body panel is changed, even the roof, as the roof gutters were replaced with more modern, integrated roof gulleys. Series production seems to have been under consideration but the car remains a one-off.

Education Chryssides holds an MA in philosophy and a BD in systematic theology from the University of Glasgow and a DPhil in philosophy of religion from the University of Oxford. Definition of new religious movements Chryssides entered the debate about how to define the category of “new religious movements.” While other scholars insist on either theological or sociological features, and suggest to identify as “new religious movements” the groups with a non- mainline theology or perceived as deviant by society, Chryssides favors a simple chronological test, although one combined with the fact that the movement is clearly outside the great world religions. For him, “new religious movement” is an organization founded “within the past 150 or so years,” which cannot be easily classified within one of the world’s main religious traditions. Study of Jehovah’s Witnesses Chryssides has been defined by fellow sociologist James T. Richardson as “one of the leading scholars” of Jehovah’s Witnesses. He sees in the Witnesses both continuity and change. Although some features of the movement remain stable, change is also frequent, making old assessments and criticism quickly outdated. Indeed, according to Chryssides, criticism itself is a main factor determining change.

It was so named because all plans for it had deep blue glass curtain walls. This site had been involved in numerous other proposals, including Stinson's own Downtown Plaza concept, and an earlier proposal that would have incorporated the neighbouring Graphic Arts Building.  First proposal  The first iteration of Sapphire Tower would have stood at or 62 floors. Scheduled to begin construction in Spring 2007, the previous 90-storey proposal on Temperance Street, which would have stood at , was rejected because of shadow and height concerns. According to a story in the February 16, 2007-edition of The Globe and Mail, after acquiring the property in 2003, high-profile Toronto developer Harry Stinson toyed with a skyscraper condo-hotel project for about a year. However, after announcing the project and securing investors, Stinson was unable to secure the full amount he needed for construction and lost control of the property when lenders recalled their loans. On November 15, 2005, the Toronto and East York Community Council, a committee of Toronto City Council, refused permission for the tower to be built on its proposed site. At issue was the thin shadow that would have been cast by the building over Nathan Phillips Square, site of Toronto's City Hall. The Council argued that it needed to \\"protect City Hall's public square\\". Stinson planned to appeal the decision to the Ontario Municipal Board. The design evolved to its proposed height in response to the approval of the Trump International Hotel & Tower by the city council. Stinson intended to create a friendly rivalry for the tallest residential building in Canada. Sapphire Tower would have been 17 metres taller. In early January 2006, Stinson announced his intent to compromise with city council. Instead of a more than 90-storey building, the focus shifted to designing a shorter building of approximately 70 storeys, with a slanted roof that would further minimize the shadow concerns. Sapphire Tower was to be operated much like Stinson's earlier hotel project 1 King West. Each of the over 1,000 suites was to be individually owned by its purchaser, with the opportunity of generating revenue through enrolment in a central management system. Facing high levels of dissent from 1 King West owners at the hotel's lack of profitability, Stinson decided not to offer the same system to Sapphire Tower purchasers. Instead, the building would have consisted primarily of private residences, where the purchaser may occupy the suite or lease it out themselves in a traditional fashion. There would have been be a small hotel component to the building of roughly 200 suites, but they would have been retained and operated by Stinson. With all the design and use changes, a new name to replace \\"Sapphire Tower\\" was expected but did not occur.  Second proposal After numerous designs the finalized height for the second proposal had been approved at 196 metres (643 feet) or 62 floors and 58,993 m² (635,000 sq. ft.) in density. Construction was expected to start in spring 2007, with an opening in early 2009. Levels 2 through to 11 would have been office space, Level 12 would have been an amenity floor for residences, Levels 13-42 would have been 'house like apartments', Levels 43-60 would have been a long stay boutique hotel, and Levels 61-62 would have been the sapphire penthouse suites in the crystalline part of the tower. On July 20, 2007, Sapphire Tower Development Corp., the parent company owned by Stinson, was approved for bankruptcy protection. All future plans of development for the Sapphire Tower were stopped. Sapphire Tower Development Corp. listed the development (including land) for sale to respective buyers in order to repay creditors.  Sale of the site  A partnership of Israel Land Development Company and Skyline International Development Inc. (the Canadian division of Mishorim) purchased the site at 70 Temperance Street in December 2007 from the property's receiver for C$24.1 million. The partners announced plans to build a 55-storey office, hotel, and residential skyscraper on the site for an estimated C$138 million. A 54-storey design by Page+Steele architects was later revealed. INDX Tower By 2011, after several designs had been released, no construction had begun. In December 2011 Mishorim sold the undeveloped lot to CentreCourt Developments for C$39 million. CentreCourt, in partnership with Lifetime, marketed as a new condo development on the lot. The 51-floor INDX Tower was completed in 2016 is shorter than the planned Sapphire Tower.

History 2015 – Official launch of the Costa Pinto mill, the first commercial facility employing Iogen’s cellulosic ethanol technology. 2014 – Iogen Corporation and Raízen announce they have begun production of cellulosic ethanol on schedule at Raízen\`s sugar cane mill in Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil. 2014 – Iogen Corporation announces it has developed and patented a new method to make drop- in cellulosic biofuels from biogas using existing refinery assets and production operations. 2013 – Iogen Corporation sells Iogen Bio-Products, its industrial enzymes business, to Danish enzyme manufacturer Novozymes for $80 million. 2013 – Raízen begins construction of a cellulosic ethanol facility using Iogen technology in Brazil. The facility is located adjacent to Raízen's Costa Pinto mill. Raízen says it plans to expand to eight cellulosic ethanol plants using Iogen's technology. 2012 - Iogen Corporation lays off 150 workers at its Ottawa headquarters. 2012 – Iogen Energy (IE) becomes a 50/50 jointly owned venture between Iogen Corp and Raízen Energia S/A, a $12 billion joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Brazilian ethanol company Cosan S.A., and enters into a research agreement with Raízen focused on commercialization of Iogen's technology in Brazil. 2012 – Iogen cellulosic ethanol production at its Ottawa, Canada demonstration plant tops 2.1 million litres (561,000 gallons). 2010 – Shell and Cosan S.A., announce their intent to form a Brazilian joint venture, ultimately named Raízen Energia, which would be the country's leading sugar processor, ethanol producer, and fuels retailer. Shell also announces intent to transfer its holdings in Iogen Energy to Raízen. 2009 – Iogen becomes the first cellulosic biofuel producer to sell its advanced biofuel at a retail service station. 2006 – Goldman Sachs invests $30 million in Iogen. 2004 - Iogen producing world’s first cellulose ethanol fuel. Technology Iogen’s cellulosic biofuels technology converts a wide variety of cellulosic feedstocks into ethanol and other biofuels. The Iogen process involves: Feedstock handling: Feedstocks such as agriculture residues are trucked to a cellulosic ethanol facility where the material is weighed and tested for moisture content. Trucks are then sent either to onsite storage, or directly to the unloading area serving the plant process. Once in the process, the feedstock particle size is reduced. When the facility is co-located with a sugarcane mill, bagasse is drawn either directly from the process or from a storage pile. In this case, no further size reduction is required. In both cases, feedstock is processed to remove debris, sand and other impurities. Pretreatment: Pretreatment is a high temperature, short residence time, mild acid hydrolysis which breaks down the feedstock and prepares it for the introduction of enzymes. Pretreatment also breaks down the hemicellulose component of the feedstock into five-carbon sugars. Pretreatment requires water, chemicals, and high pressure steam. Energy is recovered for re-use elsewhere in the process. Enzymatic hydrolysis: The enzymatic hydrolysis step is a multi-day operation run under mild conditions. Tanks receive feed slurry from pretreatment, and with the use of added enzymes, the cellulose is then broken down to produce six-carbon sugars. Lignin separation and processing: In this step, the product of hydrolysis is split into solid and liquid portions. The solid portion consists mainly of lignin which possesses a high heating value, thus making it an ideal fuel for burning in a boiler. The combustion of lignin provides enough energy to power most of the cellulosic ethanol process. The liquid portion, which contains the sugars, is then sent to fermentation. Ethanol fermentation and distillation: The five- and six-carbon sugars are now converted to ethanol using genetically modified yeasts. A dilute ethanol stream, known as beer, is generated as well as carbon dioxide. The fermentation beer is distilled into commercial-grade fuel ethanol.

Born in Lucas, Arkansas, he pitched for the St. Louis Cardinals (from 1934 to 1939), the New York Giants (from 1940 to 1941), and the St. Louis Browns (1943). Dean played several years of baseball alongside his better-known brother, Jay. Because of his brother's nickname, \\"Dizzy\\", Dean also had a nickname, Daffy, but this did not reflect his personality as he was considered quiet and serious. The nickname was mainly a creation of the press.\\"Ken Burns' Baseball Inning Five: Shadow Ball\\". Washington. PBS Video. 1994 During his rookie season (at the age of 22), Dean pitched a no-hitter on September 21, 1934 in the second game of a doubleheader against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Dizzy (who had pitched a three-hit shutout in the first game) would say afterwards: \\"Shoot! If I'da known Paul was gonna pitch a no-hitter, I'da pitched me one too.\\" Paul finished the year with a 19–11 record to help St. Louis win the National League pennant. Combined with his brother becoming the only NL pitcher in the live-ball era to win 30 games, the brothers bettered Dizzy's prediction that \\"me 'n' Paul are gonna win 45 games\\" by four wins. In the World Series, he and his brother won two games apiece, combining for a 4–1 record, 28 strikeouts and a 1.43 ERA, as the Cardinals took the series against the Detroit Tigers in seven games. The following year, Dean won 19 games again. He got injured, however, and pitched ineffectively for the rest of his career. Dean is featured prominently in some versions of Abbott & Costello's Who's on First comedy sketch. In the sketch Abbott is explaining to Costello that many ballplayers have unusual nicknames including Dizzy Dean, his brother Daffy Dean and their \\"French cousin Goo-fay Dean\\". The fictitious French cousin's name is goofy pronounced with an exaggerated French accent. Dean served in the United States Army during World War II. Dean died at age 68 in Springdale, Arkansas, from a heart attack. In the 1952 biographical film about Dizzy Dean, The Pride of St Louis, Paul was portrayed by actor Richard Crenna.

This modern instrument contains many more advanced features than early keytars such as its predecessor, the Roland AX-1, and the Yamaha SHS-10. It runs on 6 AA batteries or an external power source. It has a 45 velocity sensitive keys (without aftertouch), and a 3-character LED display. Several features aimed towards stage performance are present, such as a pitch bend ribbon, touchpad-like expression bar, sustain switch, and volume control knob, all on the upper neck of the instrument. There is also a proprietary \\"D-Beam\\" interface, made up of infrared sensors that detect nearby motion. In 2007 the Roland AX-7 was discontinued and is succeeded by the Roland AX-Synth since 2009.  MIDI functionality  This instrument functions as a MIDI controller; it produces MIDI messages that are sent to an external synthesizer or sound module. (Thus it produces no sound on its own.) It is fully compatible with General MIDI, General MIDI Level 2, and Roland's own GS MIDI implementation. It has both MIDI in and out ports, and can store up to 128 patches. Popular opinion The overall opinion of the Roland AX-7 is pretty consistent. Several reviewers have said that the AX-7 excels in Features, like the D-beam and volume knob. It also has good scores in Reliability and Sounds, even though it has no voices of its own programmed onto the keytar. However, some said that it lacks in Ease of Use and Customer Support. Some said that the user’s manual is too confusing for more lighthearted synth users, and the Customer Support knows almost nothing about the product.

It has an area of . It was created to protect its scenic landscape and the Valdivian flora to augment that of the nearby Los Alerces National Park. Originally an annex to Los Alerces, it was declared a National Park and independent reserve in 1971. The protected area is named after the Puelo Lake, and belongs to the Patagonic forest and steppes and High Andes eco-regions. The mountainous zone where the park lies was modified by the action of glaciers, which created many rivers and lakes, including Puelo Lake the namesake of the park. The rivers of the region have high levels of glacier sediment (silt), which gives Puelo Lake its blue color. Climate The climate is cold and wet, although more temperate than other parks in the Patagonian region. Mean temperatures range from in winter to in summer. Mean annual precipitation is around , most of it being concentrated between May to August. Occasionally, snowfall can occur during the coldest months. Flora and fauna Some of the flora of the park belongs to the Valdivian rain forests (avellano, tique, lingue, ulmo). It also includes the ciprés de la cordillera, the coihue, the lenga, the radal, and the arrayán. The rosa mosqueta is an exotic plant. The fauna includes the pudú, the huemul, the red fox, the cougar, and the coipo. Among birds we find the huala, the pato vapor volador, the bandurria, the pitío and the zorzal patagónico. The lake features native fish such as the perca, the peladilla and the puyén grande, and foreign species of trout. History The first settlers of the region were hunter- gatherers who lived in the steppe and employed stone tools to hunt guanacos. There are cave paintings within the park, apparently showing representations of paths into the forest. Nowadays Mapuche communities live in the eastern part of the park.

In 1940 Schütz founded the Taizé Community, an ecumenical monastic community in Burgundy, France, serving as its first prior until his murder in 2005. Towards the end of his life, the Taizé Community was attracting international attention, welcoming thousands of young pilgrims every week, which it has continued to do after his death.  Background and early life  Born on 12 May 1915, in Provence, Vaud, Schütz was the ninth and youngest child of Karl Ulrich Schütz, a Protestant pastor from Bachs in the Zürcher Unterland in Switzerland, and his wife, Amélie Henriette Marsauche, a Huguenot from Burgundy, France. From 1937 to 1940, Schütz-Marsauche studied Reformed theology in Strasbourg and Lausanne, where he was a leader in the Swiss Student Christian Movement, part of the World Student Christian Federation. Falling ill with tuberculosis, during his convalescence he began to feel drawn to a monastic way of life.  Taizé Community  Schütz at prayer in Taizé, 2004 In 1940, at the start of World War II, Schütz-Marsauche felt called to serve those suffering from the conflict, as his maternal grandmother had done during World War I. He rode a bicycle from Geneva to Taizé, a small town near Mâcon, about southeast of Paris. The town was then located within unoccupied France, just beyond the line of demarcation from the zone occupied by German troops. He bought an empty house, where for two years he and his sister, Genevieve, hid refugees, both Christian and Jewish, before being forced to leave Taizé, after being tipped off that the Gestapo had become aware of their activities. In 1944, he returned to Taizé to found the Community, initially a small quasi-monastic community of men living together in poverty and obedience, open to all Christians. Since the late 1950s, many thousands of young adults from many countries have found their way to Taizé to take part in weekly meetings of prayer and reflection. In addition, Taizé brothers make visits and lead meetings, large and small, in Africa, North and South America, Asia, and in Europe, as part of a “pilgrimage of trust on earth”. The spiritual leader always kept a low profile, rarely giving interviews and refusing to permit any \\"cult\\" to grow up around himself. Prior to his death, Brother Roger was due to give up his community functions because of his advanced age and ill-health which had seen him suffer from fatigue and often use a wheelchair. Brother Roger was a prized author and wrote many books on prayer and reflection, asking young people to be confident in God and committed to their local church community and to humanity. He also wrote books about Christian spirituality and prayer, some together with Mother Teresa with whom he shared a cordial friendship.  Ecumenism  Brother Roger with Catholic and Protestant clergy, leaving an ecumenical service in St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna, . All his life, Roger devoted himself to reconciling the different Christian denominations. He especially addressed Christian youth. Part of his appeal may have been his dislike of formal preaching, while encouraging a spiritual quest as a common endeavor. During a Taizé gathering in Paris in 1995, he spoke to more than 100,000 young people who were sitting on the floor of an exhibition hall. \\"We have come here to search\\", he said, \\"or to go on searching through silence and prayer, to get in touch with our inner life. Christ always said, 'Do not worry, give yourself'.\\" Although from a Reformed faith Presbyterian which is Protestant background, Brother Roger received the Catholic sacrament of the Eucharist at the Catholic Mass celebrated every morning in his monastery. In addition, he received the sacrament from both Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, seemingly in contravention of canonical prohibitions reserving the sacrament exclusively to those in full communion with the Catholic Church. Though, according to Cardinal Walter Kasper, this was accomplished as though there was a tacit understanding between Brother Roger and the Catholic Church \\"crossing certain confessional\\" and canonical barriers through what Brother Roger called a gradual enrichment of his faith with the foundations of the Catholic Church including \\"the ministry of unity exercised by the bishop of Rome.\\" Brother Roger thus appeared to have undertaken a step without precedent since the Protestant Reformation: entering progressively into full communion with the faith of the Catholic Church possibly without a formal \\"conversion\\" that would imply a break with his origins. In 1980, during a European Meeting in Rome, he said in Saint Peter’s Basilica in the presence of Pope John Paul II: > I have found my own identity as a Christian by reconciling within myself the > faith of my origins with the mystery of the Catholic faith, without breaking > fellowship with anyone. Death Brother Roger's grave in Taizé Brother Roger was stabbed to death during the evening prayer service in Taizé on August 16, 2005, by a young Romanian woman named Luminița Ruxandra Solcan who was later deemed mentally ill.Taizé: non-lieu psychiatrique pour la meurtrière présumée de Frère Roger He was stabbed several times and, though one of the brothers carried him from the church, he died shortly afterward. The assailant was immediately apprehended by members of the congregation and was placed in police custody. The funeral took place on 23 August 2005. Horst Köhler, the President of Germany, and Nicolas Sarkozy, at that time Minister of the Interior of France, were in attendance. Brother Roger's community and friends attended the liturgy in the vast monastery church at Taizé, while thousands more followed it on a huge screen in fields outside the church. Brother Roger's simple wooden coffin, a wooden icon lying upon it, was carried into the church by members of the community. In a highly unusual move, the funeral was presided over by a Catholic cardinal, Walter Kasper, the president of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, who celebrated the Mass with four priest-brothers of Taizé concelebrating. In his homily he said, \\"Yes, the springtime of ecumenism has flowered on the hill of Taizé.\\"At His Funeral, Brother Roger Has an Ecumenical Dream Fulfilled In reference to Brother Roger's concern for social justice, Cardinal Kasper said \\"Every form of injustice or neglect made him very sad.\\" Brother Roger's successor, Brother Alois Löser, prayed for forgiveness: \\"With Christ on the cross we say to you, Father, forgive her, she does not know what she did.\\" Successor In 1998, Brother Roger had designated Brother Alois, a German Catholic who had originally come to Taizé as a youth and became one of the brothers, as his successor. This was confirmed by the community and in January 2005, it was announced that Alois would soon be taking Roger's place as Prior of Taizé, but this had not yet occurred at the time of Roger's death, when Alois was attending the World Youth Day 2005 celebration in Cologne, Germany. He was installed as prior shortly thereafter.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1907 to 1922, and was a prominent cabinet minister in the government of Tobias Norris. Johnson was a member of the Liberal Party. Biography Johnson was born in Iceland, and moved to Manitoba with his family in 1878. He was educated in Winnipeg public schools, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Gustavus Adolphus College. After worked as a teacher, he entered the law office of Richards & Bradshaw in 1895 and was admitted to the Bar of the Province in 1900. He subsequently worked as a barrister-at-law, and was also appointed census commissioner for Manitoba in 1901. Johnson served on the Winnipeg School Board from 1904 to 1907. In religion, he was a Lutheran. He married Aurora Frederickson in 1898 and they had three children. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1907 provincial election, defeating candidates from the Conservative and Labour parties in Winnipeg West. He was re-elected over Conservative A.J. Andrews by 240 votes in the 1910 election. Following redistribution for the 1914 election, he defeated Andrews again by 1,050 votes in Winnipeg Centre \\"A\\". Manitoba was governed by Rodmond Roblin's Conservatives during this period, and Johnson served as a member of the opposition. Known as a reformer, he was popular with Winnipeg's working-class community and won the support of many progressive electors. In 1915, the Roblin government was forced to resign from office following a corruption scandal involving the tendering of contracts for new legislative buildings. Although they did not hold a majority of seats in the legislature, the Liberals under Tobias Norris were called upon to form a new administration. Norris became premier on May 15, 1915, and chose Johnson as his Minister of Public Works. A new election was held, which the Liberals won in a landslide majority. Johnson was not opposed by Labour, and received more than three times of the votes of his Conservative opponent. After a cabinet shuffle on November 10, 1917, Johnson was named Attorney General and Minister of Telephones and Telegraphs. He was not involved in the trials that resulted from the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919. Many members of Norris's government favoured a negotiated settlement with the strikers, and the subsequent legal charges against the strike leaders were launched as a private prosecution by the Citizens' Committee of one Thousand, funded by the federal Department of Justice, and allowed to proceed by Johnson as Attorney General. Later, Johnson defended the prosecutions in the spring of 1921 when Fred Dixon brought a motion to the floor of the Manitoba legislature seeking the release of the imprisoned strike leaders. Prior to the 1920 provincial election, the province's electoral laws were changed such that the city of Winnipeg became a single constituency, electing ten members by a single transferable ballot. Johnson led the Liberal ticket in the city, and was declared elected with a second-place finish on the first count. Across, the province, however, the Liberals were reduced to a minority government following the rise of Farmer and Labour parliamentary groups. Johnson resigned from cabinet on June 6, 1922, and did not run in the 1922 provincial election. He died at his home in Winnipeg on May 20, 1927.

Under the tropical zodiac, the sun transits this sign between approximately November 23 and December 21. Greek mythology associates Sagittarius with the centaur Chiron, who mentored Achilles, a Greek hero of the Trojan War, in archery. Sagittarius, the half human and half horse, is the centaur of mythology, the learned healer whose higher intelligence forms a bridge between Earth and Heaven. Also known as the Archer, Sagittarius is represented by the symbol of a bow and arrow.  Astrology Notre-Dame Along with Aries and Leo, Sagittarius is a part of the Fire Trigon as well as the last of the reproductive trinity. It also follows Gemini and Virgo as third of the mutable signs, which are the signs that feature changeable quality. The image of the sign says much about its features: he is able to be extremely violent or wise, brave or mild. When Sagittarius is depicted as an archer, then he is classified as human but when represented as a centaur, he is nonhuman (bestial). However, the classification of the astrological sign as a human or bestial does not carry practical consequences for interpretation. As an archer, Sagittarius is said never to fail in hitting the mark and this depiction alludes to the power of prophecy, hence, the claim that seers and prophets are born in this sign.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on February 7, 2002\\\\. The episode follows baby Stewie, who becomes obsessed with the fictional British children's television series \\"Jolly Farm Revue\\". He decides to run away from home to become part of the cast and his anthropomorphic dog Brian decides to chase him down in an attempt to bring him back home. Meanwhile, Peter and Lois go to a Kiss concert, where Lois reveals she knows nothing about the band, much to Peter's embarrassment. \\"Road to Europe\\" was written by Daniel Palladino and directed by Dan Povenmire. It received mostly positive reviews from critics for its storyline and its many cultural references. The episode featured Kiss members Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. It also featured guest voices by comedian Andy Dick, actor and director Jon Favreau, actor Sean Flynn, actress and singer Lauren Graham, actress Michelle Horn, and voice actor Wally Wingert. Plot summary Stewie is obsessed with a British television program called Jolly Farm Revue, a colorful children's TV show featuring several imaginary characters. Reluctant to stay in Quahog, Stewie decides to travel to \\"Jolly Farm\\" in London and live there forever. Desperate, he goes to the local airport and stowaways on a transatlantic flight, intending to travel to England, and to find the BBC studios where Jolly Farm Revue is filmed. Brian tries to stop Stewie from leaving Rhode Island, and follows him onboard the plane. When he finally finds Stewie, the plane takes off and lands in the Middle East. Brian begins to search for a way to get back to the United States, but Stewie refuses to leave with him and insists they continue to London. Brian and Stewie search for a camel to use as transportation, and they perform a musical number as a diversion in order to steal one. They begin their journey, but the camel dies in the middle of the desert. They soon find a nearby Comfort Inn, however, in which to stay. They steal a hot air balloon from the hotel premises and make their way to the Vatican City, embarrassing the Pope upon landing, then traveling by train from Switzerland to Munich, and end up in Amsterdam. Upon finally arriving at the BBC Television Centre, Stewie is shocked to discover that the farm is a set, and his beloved characters are merely burnt-out, vulgar actors. Heartbroken, Stewie decides to travel back home with Brian to Quahog after getting revenge at the Mother Maggie actress for kicking him by defecating in her shoes. This situation also causes Stewie to lose interest in the show. Meanwhile, Peter is overjoyed to hear about Kiss-stock, a five-night set of concerts in New England by his favorite band, Kiss. He and his wife, Lois, dress in face paint and leather just like the band members in Kiss, as does the rest of the crowd, and they manage to stand in the front row. When Gene Simmons points the microphone at Lois as a way to prompt her to sing the next line in the chorus of \\"Rock and Roll All Nite,\\" only to discover that she doesn't know the words, shaming Peter. Deeply saddened by this, Gene and Paul Stanley leave the stage, leaving Ace Frehley and Peter Criss to perform \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\" to cheer up the displeased audience. After the concert, Peter accuses Lois of only pretending to be a Kiss enthusiast, and they leave the concert venue in disgrace. Later that night, Peter and Lois stop at a Denny's on the way home from the concert. The Kiss members are seated at another table, and Lois recognizes Gene without his \\"Demon\\" make-up as Chaim Witz (Gene's birth name), an old friend. Peter is amazed to discover that Lois or \\"Loose Lois\\" had dated Gene when they were in high school. Peter's faith in Lois is then restored, and he proudly shares the news on public-access television that \\"my wife did Kiss.\\" Production Dan Povenmire, who also directed the first \\"Road to\\" episode, directed \\"Road to Europe\\". The episode was written by Daniel Palladino, his first official episode for the series, an executive producer for the show. In addition, the episode was directed by series regular Dan Povenmire, in his fourth episode directing for the season; the first three being \\"One If by Clam, Two If by Sea\\", \\"To Love and Die in Dixie\\", and \\"Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows\\". \\"Road to Europe\\" is the second episode of the \\"Road to...\\" hallmarks of the series, which have aired throughout various seasons of the show, and is the second \\"Road to...\\" episode to be directed by Povenmire. The episodes are a parody of the seven Road to ... comedy films starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour. The episode was inspired by the 1941 film Road to Morocco, including its musical number \\"(We're off on the) Road to Morocco\\", which was previously parodied by the two characters, then with alternate lyrics, in the Family Guy episode \\"Road to Rhode Island\\". Fans originally believed that the original title of this episode was \\"Road to Baghdad\\", but in an interview with IGN MacFarlane stated that it was not the case. In addition to the regular cast, the episode featured guest appearances by comedian Andy Dick, actor and director Jon Favreau, actor Sean Flynn, actress and singer Lauren Graham, actress Michelle Horn and voice actor Wally Wingert. It also guest starred Kiss members Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley as themselves. Cultural references \\"Road to Europe\\" features several cultural references. Brian compares Stewie's look with Charlie Brown; Stewie responds by comparing him with Charlie Brown's dog Snoopy; both these characters are from the comic strip Peanuts. At the Kiss concert, the song that the band plays, and the one that Lois does not know the lyrics to, is the single \\"Rock and Roll All Nite\\". In the song Stewie and Brian sing, the Marquis de Sade, singer Ricky Martin and actress Phylicia Rashad are mentioned. Brian also uses Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog's catch phrase, \\"For me to poop on\\" to insult Stewie. While riding a tour bus in Germany, Brian looks at a history book that has no information regarding German history from 1939 – 1945; the years on which World War II started and ended. Brian questions the tour guide about the dates when Germany invaded Poland, but the guide denies that it happened. Brian keeps insisting until the guide yells \\"Sie werden sich hinsetzen! Sie werden ruhig sein! Sie werden nicht beleidigen Deutschland!\\", literally meaning \\"You will sit down! You will be quiet! You will not insult Germany!\\" while making the Nazi salute with his left hand. The last sentence is grammatically incorrect, as the proper German statement would be, \\"Sie werden Deutschland nicht beleidigen!\\" At the beginning of the episode, the credits are presented with title cards containing images of Brian and Stewie passing by various iconic places in Europe. These include France's Eiffel Tower, Italy's Leaning Tower of Pisa and a venetian gondola, the United Kingdom's Stonehenge and Greece's Parthenon. Other iconic items shown include the Union Flag and the Pope. Reception Reviews of the episode by television critics were mostly positive. Critic Ahsan Haque of IGN placed \\"Road to Europe\\" in the top ten of Stewie and Brian's Greatest Adventures, ranking it fifth. Haque noted that the episode is not as entertaining as many of the other Stewie and Brian adventures, but the song included in the episode, \\"You and I Are So Awfully Different\\" made it worthy of an appearance on the list. \\"Road to Europe\\" is the lowest ranked Road to ... episode on the list with \\"Road to Germany\\" at number four, \\"Road to Rupert\\" at number three, \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" at number two and \\"Road to Rhode Island\\" ranked as the best.

It is considered the \\"Thermopylae of the Confederacy\\" and prevented Texas from being conquered by the Union. For his actions, Dowling received the \\"thanks of Congress\\" (of the Confederate States), Davis Guards Medal, Southern Cross of Honor, and Confederate Medal of Honor. Over a dozen other memorials have also been dedicated in his honor. Biography Dowling was born in the townland of Knockballyvishteal, Milltown, County Galway, Ireland in January 1837, the second of eight children, born to tenant farmer Patrick and Bridget Dowling (née Qualter). Following eviction of his family from their home in 1845, the first year of the Great Famine, nine-year-old Dowling left Ireland with his older sister Honora, bound for New Orleans in the United States in 1846.Dick Dowling: Galway's hero of Confederate Texas, by Timothy Collins and Ann Caraway Ivins. Old Forge Books, 2013 As a teenager, young Dick Dowling displayed his entrepreneurial skills by successfully running the Continental Coffeehouse, a saloon in the fashionable French Quarter. His parents and siblings followed from Ireland in 1851, but the joy of reunion was short- lived. In 1853, a yellow fever outbreak in New Orleans took the lives of his parents and one of his younger brothers. With rising anti-Irish feeling growing in New Orleans, following local elections which saw a landslide victory for the 'Know Nothing' party, Dowling moved to Houston in 1857, where he leased the first of a number of saloons, a two-story building centrally located on the corner of Main and Prairie Streets. He named it the Shades, from the sycamore and cottonwood trees which lined the two streets and shaded the building. Advertised as 'inferior to none in the state' he opened a billiards saloon on the first floor. Dowling was described as a likable red- headed Irishman and wore a large moustache, possibly to make him appear older than he looked, as he was called 'The Kid' by family and friends alike at this time. In 1857 he married Elizabeth Ann Odlum, daughter of Benjamin Digby Odlum, a Kildare-born Irishman, who had fought in the Texas War of Independence, being captured at the Battle of Refugio in 1836. Following Texas Independence, he was elected subsequently to the fledgling Third Congress of the Republic of Texas. Business and civic interests By 1860, Dowling owned a number of saloons. His most successful was named the Bank of Bacchus,map showing the location of the Bank of Bacchus located on Courthouse Square in downtown Houston. \\"The Bank\\" as it was known locally became Houston's most popular social gathering place in the 1860s and was renowned for its hospitality. Dowling's previous experience as a barkeeper in New Orleans stood him in good stead. Quickly establishing himself, Dowling courted publicity from local newspapers and also made a number of property investments. He was also involved in setting up Houston's first gaslight company, and was first to have it installed in his home and \\"The Bank\\". Dowling was a founding member of Houston's Hook and Ladder Company Number One fire department and was also involved in running the city's first streetcar company American Civil War Background = Prior to the outbreak of the Civil War, Dowling had made a name for himself as an able and successful entrepreneur. Among other things, he had been involved with a predominantly Irish militia company which served a more social than military role in Houston society. On Secession, this militia company was mustered straight into the Confederate Army, with Dowling himself being elected First Lieutenant. Composed primarily of Houston Irish, many of them clients from his saloons, this unit named themselves the \\"Davis Guards\\" in honor of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who had been in Texas as a young officer in the pre-war United States Army and was remembered for his prowess and leadership skills. The Davis Guards were initially part of a Texas State Troops/Confederate expedition sent to take over Union Army forts and arsenals along the border with Mexico; the expedition was successfully completed without a shot being fired. They participated in the Battle of Galveston on New Year's Day 1863, following which they were assigned to a newly constructed artillery post near the mouth of Sabine River called \\"Fort Sabine\\" (later named \\"Fort Griffin\\", not the same as the later Fort Griffin established west of Fort Worth). = Prelude = Sabine Pass was important as a point of arrival and departure for blockade runners. With the fall of Vicksburg in July 1863, followed by the Battle of Gettysburg, it was obvious that the Civil War was now not going well for the Confederacy, an invasion of Texas appeared to be imminent. It was suspected that the Union Army would attempt an invasion of Texas via Sabine Pass, because of its value as a harbor for blockade runners and because about 18 miles northwest was Beaumont, on the railroad between Houston and the eastern part of the Confederacy. To negotiate Sabine Pass all vessels except small boats took one of the two river channels, both of about 5 feet (1.5 meters) depth and one on each side of the Pass. These channels were separated by naturally formed \\"oyster-banks\\" known to be barely two feet (0.60 meter) under the surface. No seagoing ship could traverse the Pass without great risk of going aground, if it did not follow one of the channels. The inevitable course of any steam-powered warship—including shallow-draft gunboats then common to the U.S. Navy—would necessarily use one of the channels, both of which were within fair range of the fort's six smoothbores. Dowling spent the summer of 1863 at the earthen fort instructing his men in gunnery. To mark the optimum distance and elevation for each of the guns, he implemented the technique of setting long slender poles (painted white, in this instance) in both channels at several places. This was an old method for guiding boats and, especially since the advent of firearms, to mark an aiming points for guns. = Defense of Sabine Pass, Texas = On 8 September 1863 a Union Navy flotilla of some 22 gunboats and transports with 5,000 men accompanied by cavalry and artillery arrived off the mouth of Sabine Pass. The plan of invasion was sound, but monumentally mismanaged. Four of the flanking gunboats were to steam up the pass at speed and draw the fire of the fort, two in each channel, a tactic which had been used successfully in subduing the defensive fortifications of Mobile and New Orleans prior to this, when gunboats disabled the forts at close range with their own guns. This time, though, Dowling's artillery drills paid off as the Confederates poured a rapid and withering fire onto the incoming gunboats, scoring several direct hits, disabling and capturing two, while the others retreated in disarray. The rest of the flotilla retreated from the mouth of the pass and returned ignominiously to New Orleans, leaving the disabled ships with no option but to surrender to Dowling. With a command of just 47 men, Lieut. Dowling had thwarted an attempted invasion of Texas, in the process capturing two gunboats, some 350 prisoners and a large quantity of supplies and munitions. = Davis Guards Medal = The Confederate States Congress offered its appreciation to Dowling, now promoted to Major, and his command, as a result of their battlefield prowess. In gratitude, the \\"ladies of Houston\\" presented the unit with specially struck medals. The medals were actually Mexican eight reale coins with both faces sanded down and with new information carved into them. They were inscribed \\"Sabine Pass, 1864\\" on one side, and had a Maltese Cross with the letters D and G on the other. =After the war and death= Major Richard Dowling, General James Longstreet, and unidentified veterans. After the battle of Sabine Pass Dowling was elevated to hero status in his hometown of Houston. John Nova Lomax of the Houston Press stated that in that city \\"Dowling was treated something like Julius Caesar home from a punishing foray into Gaul.\\" He subsequently served as a recruiter for the Confederacy and was personally commended for his action at the battle by Jefferson Davis. After the war Dowling returned to his saloon business in Houston and quickly became one of the city's leading businessmen. Dowling's promising future was cut short by another yellow fever epidemic which devastated Houston in the late summer of 1867, and he died on 23 September 1867. He was buried at St. Vincent's Catholic Cemetery, the oldest Catholic cemetery in Houston.Davis, Rod. \\"Houston's really good idea Bus tour celebrates communities that forged a city.\\" San Antonio Express-News.

Lomax wrote in 2009 is that by then very few people in the city memorialized him and that the group was \\"vanishing (if not downright extinct)\\". In regards to sites named after Dowling, Lomax stated that there have been objections to sites named after Dowling, \\"But this being Houston, where 1980 is ancient history, nothing is ever done.\\" Two sites, now Emancipation Drive and Lawson Middle School (formerly Dowling Street and Dowling Middle School) have since been renamed. = Davis Guards Medal (1863) = The Davis Guards Medal was presented by the \\"ladies of Houston\\" in 1863 to the artillery company.

It was relocated to Sam Houston Park in 1939 and Hermann Park near the Sam Houston Monument in 1958. This was the first public monument commissioned by the city government; he was chosen as he fought in favor of the CSA.  Historical Marker (1998)  The site received a Historical Marker (#11938) by the Texas Historical Commission in 1998. = Obelisk (1935) = In October 1935, a granite obelisk was built near Dowling's grave at Saint Vincent's Cemetery in Houston. The plaque reads: \\"Near this spot lies LT DICK DOWLING Hero of the Battle of Sabine Pass\\". = Sabine Pass Battleground State Historic Site (1936) = The Sabine Pass Battleground State Historic Site is the location of the Defense of Sabine Pass, Texas. It is a heritage site operated by the Texas Historical Commission. It features a statue of Dowling and memorial dedicated to the Davis Guards from the State of Texas in 1936.

Geographically, South Andros is the southernmost third of the land mass colloquially called Andros, which includes the districts of North Andros, Central Andros, Mangrove Cay and South Andros. In 2010, the district had 3,592 inhabitants.SOUTH ANDROS POPULATION BY SETTLEMENT AND TOTAL NUMBER OF OCCUPIED DWELLINGS: 2010 CENSUS - Bahamas Department of Statistics Transportation The districts are divided by broad unspanned \\"creeks\\", some of which offer public ferry crossing; otherwise the only way to travel from one district to another is by private plane or boat. South Andros is accessed from Nassau via commercial airline (currently two trips daily from Nassau to South Andros Airport), from the U.S. via two flights commercially from Fort Lauderdale International and other islands by charter airplane (usually from Fort Lauderdale, Florida), and from anywhere by private boat. A public ferry runs daily between South Andros and its northern neighboring Mangrove Cay which is also considered a part of South Andros. The mail boat comes to Andros once a week from Nassau, leaving Nassau Monday night and arriving at Drigg's Hill port on South Andros on Tuesday morning, which brings the majority of all imports and supplies to the island, from milk to petrol. =Roads= The Queen's Highway, a two lane paved and illuminated road without traffic lights, runs approximately from the northernmost edge of South Andros which is the port of Drigg's Hill, to the dockside settlement of Mars Bay. At Mars Bay the road ends in a cul de sac but the island extends approximately further south without roads or services, inaccessible except by boat. In its course from Drigg's Hill to Mars Bay, the highway crosses two bridges, one at Deep Creek and one further south at Little Creek, both refurbished in 2012. Settlements Almost the entire population of South Andros lives in housing abutting the Queen's Highway and a few short, paved roads trailing off it. The only other significant road is that leading west, inland, along the north side of Deep Creek, to Black Point, where there are a handful of additional homes. South Andros' widest point is about east to west, but only the eastern fringe is inhabited, as most of the island consists of salty marsh and tidal estuaries. All housing on South Andros consists of small, single family homes, sometimes clustered in small groups on a single tract of land, and almost all buildings are made of cement block and/or local limestone, as wood is expensive to import and does not withstand hurricanes well. Government provided electric, telephone and rubbish disposal services are available to all homes on the island, with a major power generation plant located mid-island in the settlement called The Bluff or Blufftown. Municipal water is supplied to much of the island inhabitants but for residents in the southern part of the island, water is obtained by catchment or private well: many parts of Andros enjoy an abundance of underground fresh water lenses. Natural gas is purchased by the tank, brought in weekly by mail boat from Nassau. Economy South Andros is known for the production of certain seasonal delicacies, fresh conch, land crab, and spiny lobster, in relative abundance, which are sold commercially in Nassau or to the representatives of Nassau food distributors, providing an important source of cash to many inhabitants. The only other current industry of note is tourism. Albeit limited, there is a small upscale ecotourism lodge, a 36-room traditional hotel and as well the management of \\"bonefish lodges,\\" small hotels which offer all-inclusive packages for tourists wishing to fish the world-famous \\"bonefish flats\\" of the southeastern fringe of the island. As of summer 2005, there were 4-6 such lodges in operation, each maintaining 4-12 guest rooms. The very low level of tourist traffic supports few restaurants and almost no shops aside from the necessary basic hardware and grocery stores. People and facilities South Andros is also the origins of many notable Bahamians like Dame Marguerite Pindling Governor General of The Bahamas and the wife of the late Sir Lynden Pindling), Picewell Forbes (longtime radio personality and current Member of Parliament for South Andros), Renward Wells, current Member of Parliament for Bamboo Town, Dr Leon Higgs (former President of the College of the Bahamas), and well-known businessman Garrett “Tiger” Finlayson. The majority of South Andros residents are members of either Baptist or Seventh- day Adventist Church congregations, with a few Catholic, Anglican and other denominations represented by a church or two. There are no movie theatres, video rental stores, chain restaurants, major hotels, or major car rental agencies on South Andros; however, Bank of the Bahamas has a branch in Kemp's Bay (ATM & public banking on Wednesdays).

He also invented the strategic board game Risk in 1957. Life Lamorisse was born in Paris, France. He first came into prominence – just after Bim (1950) – for directing and producing White Mane (1953), an award-winning short film that tells a fable of how a young boy befriends an untamable wild white stallion in the marshes of Camargue (the Petite Camargue). Lamorisse's best known work is the short film The Red Balloon (1956), which earned him the Palme d'Or Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and an Oscar for writing the Best Original Screenplay in 1956.Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Awards Database Lamorisse also wrote, directed and produced the well-regarded films Stowaway in the Sky (1960) and Circus Angel, as well as the documentaries Versailles and Paris Jamais Vu. In addition to films, he created the popular strategy board game Risk in 1957.The Red Balloon, IMDb database entry. In the mid-sixties Lamorisse shot parts of The Prospect of Iceland, a documentary about Iceland, which was made by Henry Sandoz and commissioned by NATO. Lamorisse died in a helicopter crash while filming the documentary Le Vent des amoureux (The Lovers' Wind), during a helicopter-tour of Iran in 1970. The helicopter was left where it crashed as a memorial to the filmmaker, and was still visible . His son and widow completed the film, based on his production notes, and released it eight years later. It was nominated for a posthumous Oscar for best documentary.

As defined in MARPOL Annex II, chemical tanker means a ship constructed or adapted for carrying in bulk any liquid product listed in chapter 17 of the International Bulk Chemical Code.[MARPOL Annex II, Chapter I, Regulation 1] As well as industrial chemicals and clean petroleum products, such ships also often carry other types of sensitive cargo which require a high standard of tank cleaning, such as palm oil, vegetable oils, tallow, caustic soda, and methanol. Oceangoing chemical tankers range from to 35,000 DWT in size, which is smaller than the average size of other tanker types due to the specialized nature of their cargo and the size restrictions of the port terminals where they call to load and discharge. Chemical tankers normally have a series of separate cargo tanks which are either coated with specialized coatings such as phenolic epoxy or zinc paint, or made from stainless steel. The coating or cargo tank material determines what types of cargo a particular tank can carry: stainless steel tanks are required for aggressive acid cargoes such as sulfuric and phosphoric acid, while 'easier' cargoes — such as vegetable oil — can be carried in epoxy coated tanks. The coating or tank material also influences how quickly tanks can be cleaned. Typically, ships with stainless steel tanks can carry a wider range of cargoes and can clean more quickly between one cargo and another, which justifies the additional cost of their construction. Classification In general, ships carrying chemicals in bulk are classed into three types: =Type 1= Tankers intended to transport products with very serious environmental and safety hazards requiring maximum preventive measures to prevent any leakage of cargo. =Type 2= Tankers intended to transport products with appreciably severe environmental and safety hazards requiring significant preventive measures to preclude an escape of such cargo. =Type 3= Tankers intended to transport products with sufficiently severe environmental and safety hazards to require a moderate degree of containment to increase survival capability in a damaged condition.[IBC Code, Chapter 2, 2.1 General] Most chemical tankers are IMO 2 and 3 rated, since the volume of IMO 1 cargoes is very limited. Main characteristics of chemical tankers Chemical tankers often have a system for tank heating in order to maintain the viscosity of certain cargoes, typically by passing pressurized steam through stainless steel 'heating coils' in the cargo tanks, transferring heat into the cargo, which circulates in the tank by convection. All modern chemical tankers feature double-hull construction and most have one hydraulically driven, submerged cargo pump for each tank with independent piping, which means that each tank can load a separate cargo without any mixing. Consequently, many oceangoing chemical tankers may carry numerous different grades of cargo on the same voyage, often loading and discharging these \\"parcels\\" at different ports or terminals. This means that the scheduling, stowage planning and operation of such ships requires a high level of coordination and specialist knowledge, both at sea and on shore. Tank cleaning after discharging cargo is a very important aspect of chemical tanker operations, because cargo residue can adversely affect the purity of the next cargo loaded. Before tanks are cleaned, they must be properly ventilated and checked to be free of potentially explosive gases. Chemical tankers usually have transverse stiffeners on deck rather than inside the cargo tanks, in order to make the tank walls smooth and thus easier to clean using permanently fitted tank cleaning machines. Cargo tanks, either empty or filled, are normally protected against explosion by inert gas blankets. Often nitrogen is the inert gas used, supplied either from portable gas bottles or a Nitrogen generator. Most new chemical tankers are built by shipbuilders in Japan, Korea or China, with other builders in Turkey, Italy, Germany and Poland. Japanese shipbuilders now account for the large majority of stainless steel chemical tankers built, as welding stainless steel to the accuracy required for cargo tank construction is a difficult skill to acquire. Notable major chemical tanker operators include MOL Chemical Tankers, Stolt- Nielsen, Odfjell, Navig8 and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, ASM. Charterers, the end users of the ships, include oil majors, industrial consumers, commodity traders and specialist chemical companies.

The Russian (Julian) calendar date is 10 April. See Comte Paul Vasili, La Sainte Russie : la cour, l'armée, le clergé, la bourgeoisie et le peuple, Libraire de Firmin-Didot et Cie, Paris, 1890 April 1847 – 17 February 1909) was a son of Emperor Alexander II of Russia, a brother of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and the senior Grand Duke of the House of Romanov during the reign of his nephew, Emperor Nicholas II. Grand Duke Vladimir followed a military career and occupied important military positions during the reigns of the last three Russian Emperors. Interested in artistic and intellectual pursuits; he was appointed President of the Academy of Fine Arts. He functioned as a patron of many artists and as a sponsor of the Imperial ballet.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs , p. 35 During the reign of his father, Emperor Alexander II, he was made Adjutant-General, senator in 1868 and a member of the Council of State in 1872. His brother, Alexander III, also promoted his career. He became a member of the Council of Ministers, Commander of the Imperial Guards CorpsAlexander, Once a Grand Duke, p. 139 and Military Governor of Saint Petersburg. He tried to exert some influence over his nephew Tsar Nicholas II, but had to content himself with holding a rival court with his wife Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna at his palace in Saint Petersburg. The events of Bloody Sunday in 1905, while he was Military Governor of St Petersburg, tarnished his reputation. During the last years of his life, the rift between his family and that of Nicholas II widened.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 98 He died after a stroke in 1909. Early life Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich was born on 22 April 1847 at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg.Chavchavadze, The Grand Dukes, p. 103 He was fourth among the eight children of Alexander II of Russia and his wife Maria Alexandrovna, born Princess Marie of Hesse-Darmstadt. He was eight years old when at the death of his grandfather Nicholas I, his father became Russian tsar. Grand Duke Vladimir was well educated and through his life he was interested in literature and the arts. However, as all male members of the Romanov family he had to follow a military career. As only the third son in a numerous family, he was far from the succession to the Russian throne. Nevertheless, in 1865, the early death of his eldest brother, the Tsarevich Nicholas, left Vladimir unexpectedly close to the throne as heir presumptive after his second brother Alexander. Unlike Alexander, the new heir, Vladimir was witty and ambitious. Rumors circulated at the time, that Alexander II would have his eldest surviving son removed from the succession placing Vladimir as his heir. Alexander himself would have preferred to step aside from the succession hoping to marry morganatically, but eventually he yielded to family pressure and married a suitable bride.Chavchavadze, The Grand Dukes, p. 105 Relations between the two brothers, although cordial, were never warm. A Russian Grand Duke Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich was a notorious playboy in his youthZeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 96 photo by Sergei Lvovich Levitsky In 1867 Grand Duke Vladimir was named honorary president of the Russian ethnographic society, the same year he accompanied his father and his brother Alexander to the World Fair in Paris, where his father was shot by a Polish nationalist. In 1871 he visited the Caucasus region, Georgia, Chechnya and Dagestan with his father and his brothers. In 1872 he accompanied his father to Vienna at the reunion of the three emperors: Russia, Germany and Austria. A member of the European beau monde, he made frequent trips to Paris. He became portly as a young man, although in later life he slimmed down. He was a skillful painter and gathered an important book collection. He was a well known gourmet, accumulating a collection of menus copied after meals, adding notations with his impressions about the food. Marriage Grand Duke Vladimir and Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg Schwerin. Engagement photograph, spring 1874Zeepvat, The Camera and the Tsars, p. 45 While traveling through Germany with his family in June 1871, Grand Duke Vladimir met Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (14 May 1854 – 6 September 1920), daughter of Friedrich Franz II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Augusta of Reuss-Köstritz.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 94 She was seventeen years old and was already engaged to a distant relative, Prince George of Schwarzburg. Grand Duke Vladimir was then twenty four. They were smitten with each other. Vladimir was a second cousin of Maria's father Friedrich Franz II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, a grandson of Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna of Russia. They were also second cousins in descent from Frederick William III of Prussia. In order to marry Vladimir, Maria broke off her previous engagement, but she refused to yield to the necessary conversion to the Orthodox religion.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 95 This delayed the couple's engagement for almost two years. Finally, Tsar Alexander II consented to Marie's continued adherence to her Lutheran faith, allowing Vladimir to marry her without loss of his rights to the Russian throne. The engagement was announced in April 1874. The wedding took place in Saint Petersburg on 28 August 1874 at the Winter palace. Vladimir's wife adopted the patronymic Pavlovna upon her marriage and was known as Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia. Only decades later, after Vladimir's death, she converted to the Russian Orthodox confession, then, Emperor Nicholas II bestowed her the title \\"the Orthodox Grand Duchess\\". Grand Duke Vladimir and his wife were both witty and ambitious. They enjoy entertaining and their residence in St. Petersburg became the heart of the Imperial capital social life. Well suited to each other, they had a long and happy marriage.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818–1959, p. 68 Vladimir's palace By the time of his marriage, construction had already been completed on Vladimir's own residence and he moved there with his wife. Named the Vladimir Palace, it was the last imperial palace to be constructed in Saint Petersburg. Grand Duke Vladimir appointed architect Aleksandr Rezanov to head the project because of his knowledge of ancient Russian architecture.Belyakova, The Romanov Legacy , p. 158 Rezanov was assisted by a team of architects: Vasily Kenel, Andrei Huhn, Ieronim Kitner and Vladimir Shreter. The foundation stone was laid on 15 July 1867.Belyakova, The Romanov Legacy , p. 160 Construction work lasted five years, from 1867 to 1872. The furniture was designed by architect Victor Shroeter. The site chosen for the palace was the Embankment near the Winter Palace in the center of St Petersburg. It had previously been occupied by the house of Count Vorontsov Dashkov which had been bought by the treasury. The lot was enlarged by purchasing the neighboring house of Madame Karatinga. The total construction and furnishing cost of Vladimir palace was 820,000 rubles, a much modest amount than the one spent building previous palaces for other grand dukes a decade earlier. The Vladimir palace stands, like the Winter Palace and the Marble Palace, on the Neva at Dvorstsovaya Embankment.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs , p. 36 The façade, richly ornamented with stucco rustication, was patterned after Leon Battista Alberti's palazzi in Florence. The main porch is built of Bremen sandstone and adorned with griffins, coats-of-arms, and cast-iron lanterns. Other details are cast in portland cement. The palace and its outbuildings contain some 360 rooms, all decorated in eclectic historic styles: Neo-Renaissance (reception room, parlor), Gothic Revival (dining room), Russian Revival (Oak Hall), Rococo (White Hall), Byzantine style (study), Louis XIV, various oriental styles, and so on. This interior ornamentation, further augmented by Maximilian Messmacher in 1881–1891, is considered a major monument to the 19th-century passion for historicism.Belyakova, The Romanov Legacy , p. 172 Grand Duke Vladimir decorated his apartments with his collection of Russian painting by the best artists of his time, such as Ilya Repin, Ivan Aivazovsky, Feodor Bruni, Vasili Vereshchagin, Ivan Kramskoy, Mikhail Vrubel, Nikolai Sverchkov and Rudoplh Frenz.Belyakova, The Romanov Legacy , p. 162 Children Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich and his wife Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna had five children: * Grand Duke Alexander Vladimirovich of Russia (31 August 1875 – 16 March 1877). He died in infancy * Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia (12 October (N.S.), 1876 – 12 October 1938). He married his first cousin Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. They had three children. * Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich of Russia (1877–1943). He married his mistress Zinaida Rashevskaya. He did not leave legitimate descendants. * Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia (1879–1956). He married his mistress Matilda Kchessinska. They had one son. * Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia (1882–1957). She married Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, third son of George I of Greece and Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia. They had three daughters. During three reigns Grand Duke Vladimir with his wife and children in 1884. The children are, from left to right, Boris, Elena, Kirill and Andrei.Zeepvat, The Camera and the Tsars, p. 47 Grand Duke Vladimir occupied important military positions during three reigns. He experienced battle in the Russo-Turkish War of (1877–1878), attending the war campaign with his father and brothers Alexander and Sergei.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818–1959, p. 72 He fought against the Turkish troops as the commanding officer of the XII Corps of the Russian army. However his military career interested him less than art and literature.Alexander, Once a Grand Duke, p. 138 In 1880, his father appointed him President of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts. He was also a member of the Academy of Science and agent of the Rumyantsev Museum.Zeepvat, The Camera and the Tsars, p. 136 Grand Duke Vladimir was in the Imperial capital when his father was killed and was succeeded by Alexander III in 1881. It fell upon Vladimir, who regained his composure more quickly than his brother, to announce their father's death to the public.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818–1959, p. 91 Vladimir inherited his father's personal library which the grand duke added to his large book collection that was arranged in three libraries at the Vladimir Palace.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs , p. 37 After the Russian revolution these books were sold off randomly by weight and currently form part of several American university collections. Although Alexander III was not close to Vladimir and there was a rivalry between their wives, he promoted his brother's career. The day after their father's death he appointed Vladimir Military Governor of St Petersburg, a post that was previously held by their uncle Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich. Vladimir served on the state council and chaired the official commission that supervised the building of the Cathedral of St. Saviour, built between 1883 and 1907 on the site of the assassination of his father, Tsar Alexander II of Russia. Grand Duke Vladimir, was a keen philanthropist. A talented painter himself, he became a famous patron of the arts. He frequented many artists and gathered a valuable collection of paintings and old icons.Alexander, Once a Grand Duke, p. 137 He later took a great interest in ballet. He financed the tour of Diaghilev Ballets Russes. Emperor Alexander III's three sons rendered Vladimir and his own three sons remote in the line of succession to Russia's throne. Nevern 1888 when Alexander III with his wife and all of their children were involved in a train accident at Borki. Vladimir and his wife were at the time in Paris and did not bother to come back to Russia. This annoyed Alexander III who commented that if he would have died with his children, Vladimir would have rushed to return to Russia to become Emperor.Chavchavadze, The Grand Dukes, p. 104 At Alexander III's death in 1894 there were unfounded rumors that the army intended to proclaim Grand Duke Vladimir emperor in place of his nephew Nicholas II.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs , p. 63 Over which Vladimir tried to have an influence, particularly at the beginning of Nicholas II's reign.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs , p. 67 Although the grand duke was conservative in his political views, he did not believe in human virtues. A little bit of a rascal himself, he preferred the company of amusing witty people regardless of their ideology or background. The more liberal members of Russian society were invited to lavish parties at his residence. He often intimidated people with his coarseness, rudeness and hot temper. Vladimir Alexandrovich was also a devoted family man. He was close to his children. Last years The Vladimirs, on the occasion of their silver wedding in 1899. From the left: Grand Duke Andrei, Grand Duke Vladimir, Grand Duchess Elena, Grand Duke Kirill, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, and Grand Duke Boris.Zeepvat, The Camera and the Tsars, p. 54 In January 1905 a wave of strikes broke out in St. Petersburg.Lincoln, The Romanovs, p. 645 On 9 January (O.S.)/22 (N.S.) a peaceful procession of workers led by a priest, Father Georgy Gapon, marched towards the Winter Palace from different points in the city hoping to present requests for reforms directly to Emperor Nicholas II.Lincoln, The Romanovs, p. 649 The Tsar, however, was not in the capital.Lincoln, The Romanovs, p. 650 General Ivan Fullon, St Petersburg Governor, tried to stop the march. When a large group of workers reached Winter Palace Square, troops acting on direct orders from Guards Commander Prince Sergei Vasilchikov opened fire upon the demonstrators. More than 100 marchers were killed and several hundred were wounded. Although Grand Duke Vladimir claimed no direct responsibility about that tragedy, since he was also away from the city, his reputation was tarnished. The massacre, known as Bloody Sunday, was followed by a series of strikes in other cities, peasant uprisings in the country, and mutinies in the armed forces, which seriously threatened the tsarist regime and became known as the Revolution of 1905. A month after Bloody Sunday, Vladimir's brother Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich was killed by a terrorist bomb in Moscow.Lincoln, The Romanovs, p. 651 In October that same year, Vladimir's eldest son and heir Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia married his first cousin Victoria Melita of Saxe- Coburg and Gotha, daughter of Vladimir's sister Maria. This marriage was disapproved by Nicholas II and Kirill was stripped of his imperial titles and banished.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 100 Vladimir protested the treatment given to his son and resigned from all his posts in protest.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 101 Although eventually Nicholas II relented and forgave his cousins for marrying without his consent, he did not allow them to return to Russia. The full pardon came only after several deaths in the family, including Vladimir's own, had placed Kirill third in the line of succession to the Imperial Throne. Grand Duke Vladimir died suddenly on 4(O.S.)/17(N.S.) February 1909 after suffering a major cerebral hemorrhage.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818–1959, p. 180 Vladimir's widow and their four children survived the Russian Revolution of 1917. In 1924 in exile, Kirill proclaimed himself Emperor de jure, Vladimir's line thereby claimed headship of the Imperial House. Vladimir was the paternal grandfather and namesake of the future pretender claimant Grand Duke Vladimir of Russia, born 1917. Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich's great granddaughter, Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna, is the current claimant.

It consists of 127 human and animal figures engraved on the rockwall probably carved during the late Neolithic, or before 2000 BC. They are the oldest known work of art in the Philippines. These inscriptions clearly show stylized human figures, frogs and lizards, along with other designs that may have depicted other interesting figures but erosion may have caused it to become indistinguishable. The engravings are mostly symbolic representations and are associated with healing and sympathetic magic. The site is sacred for indigenous Tagalog folk religion and is believed to be a home for anitos. The site has been declared by the National Museum of the Philippines as a National Cultural Treasure in 1973. It is also included in the list of the World Inventory of Rock Art in 1985 and historic sites of the World Monuments Watch and World Monuments Funds and part of the Philippines' tentative list of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. History Angono Petroglyphs, considered oldest form of art in the Philippines dated during the late Neolithic period. A closeup of the rock carvings of the Angono Petroglyphs. The existence of a rock shelter was reported to the National Museum by the late National Artist of the Philippines Carlos V. Francisco in March 1965 during a field trip with several boy scouts along the boundaries of Angono, Binangonan and Antipolo of the province of Rizal. Since then, some rock carvings have been damaged due to neglect and vandalism. In 1973, by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 260, it was declared as a national cultural treasure by the Philippine government. During that time, a team led by the National Museum of the Philippines started archaeological site conservation and site development of the petroglyphs in which a mini-museum, view deck and stone path, among others, were constructed. It was included in the list of National Cultural Treasures in 1973 and World Inventory of Rock Art in 1985. In 1996, The World Monuments Fund included Angono Petroglyphs on its list of preservation projects and has helped with the installation of a drainage system and assigned a caretaker to protect the site. The site is also on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the Philippines.  Description  The Angono Petroglyphs is located in a shallow rock shelter. It measures 63 meters wide, 8 meters deep and a maximum height of 5 meters. It has been created due to faulting and formed in volcanic soil during the Quaternary period. There are 127 drawings in the form of animate and static figures of circular or dome-like head on top of a 'V' shaped torso distributed on a horizontal plane on the rock wall area measuring 25 meters by 3 meters. Only 51 of the total 127 drawings are distinct. Due to the complexity and plurality of the drawings, it is suggested that the drawings on the rock were not only created by a single individual. It is widely believed that the figures drawn on the walls are for healing purposes as the site is a dambana. Researchers have argued that the figures were medicinal and religious in function as they were made by ancestors to transfer the sickness of a child onto the limestone wall, thus, curing the child from ailments.  Archaeological excavations  From October to November 1965, archaeological excavations, headed by Alfredo Evangelista, was done on the area of the rock shelter. Fragmented bits of earthenware, two pieces of obsidian flakes, two chert, flake stone tools, one stone core tool and polished stone adze with a blunted working edge were excavated in the rock shelter. The artifacts suggest that the site was used during the Neolithic age, or earlier than 2000 BC. In 2018, Jalandoni & Taçon proposed that the petroglyphs consist of two different phases created by different cultures. The older Phase 1 is composed of around 51 geometric shapes; including 11 disembodied vulva forms that are depicted as bisected triangles or ovals, small holes (cupules), and at least one human figure with bent elbows and knees. Phase 1 is believed to be created by Australo-Melanesian (Negrito) hunter-gatherers using stone tools. Phase 2, on the other hand, modified Phase 1 petroglyphs by adding limbs, heads, and torsos to previous stick human figures. Some depicted as having horn-like or rectangular-shaped headdresses, while three were holding curved objects. Four of the human forms had a bowling pin shape, three had oval bodies, and one had a \\"fishtail\\" for legs. Phase 2 is much more recent, with much sharper edges and lines, and may have been carved by Austronesian hunter-gatherers. Modern graffiti also contaminate the site, and there is a possibility that Phase 2 may also possibly be modern and carved by Philippine guerilla forces hiding in the caves during World War 2.  Management  The preservation and development of the Angono Petroglyphs is a collective effort of the National Museum of the Philippines, the Department of Tourism, World Monuments Fund, American Express and a Philippine real estate company. It was first opened to the public in 1989, with a green-painted iron fence and a low concrete wall separating the rock wall from viewers. The previous landowner, Antipolo Properties Inc. donated the land directly in front of the shelter to the National Museum, and they also maintain access roads, cleared vegetation, and bore a tunnel through the ridge for easier access by tourists. A viewing deck was installed by the National Museum in 1997. The site was closed for 14 months until October 2015 for renovations and the installation of a newer viewing deck. Graffiti by visitors is a problem. And though the site provides \\"visitor books\\" for guests to draw upon, these are rarely used as they are safeguarded by the National Museum staff. The tunnel leading to the area is not monitored and is also the site for graffiti by visitors, though these may have a positive impact as it channels away graffiti from the main site. The site of the Angono Petroglyphs is developed as the Angono Branch of the National Museum showcasing the cultural and artistic heritage of the province of Rizal. Its collections include remains of giant turtle, tusks, fossils, molar of Elephas sp., tradeware ceramics and paintings.

Jackson Jr. is an American Christian preacher and Pentecostal bishop who serves as the senior pastor at Hope Christian Church in Beltsville, Maryland, and serves as the Presiding bishop of the International Communion of Evangelical Churches. He is also a social conservative activist and commentator and is known for his opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion. Jackson is the founder and chairman of the High Impact Leadership Coalition, which is composed of ministers who actively promote socially conservative causes. Bishop Jackson is also a co-founder of The Reconciled Church Initiative which seeks to bring racial healing to the church and America. Early life Jackson was raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. He became involved in political activism as a child with his mother, Essie. He went to Cincinnati Country Day School where he commented in an interview that \\"I was the black kid at Country Day who stayed in the houses of wealthy white people\\". He attended Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where he played football. He got a tryout with the New England Patriots but didn't make the team. Jackson's family moved to the Washington, D.C. area in 1973, eventually settling in Silver Spring, Maryland. After graduating from college, he got a high-level executive job at Republic Steel and was admitted to Harvard Business School. He married his wife, Michele, in 1976. Ministry The death of his father, Harry Jackson Sr., caused Jackson to decide to become a Christian minister. He and his wife moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where he preached in the inner city. Soon he took a job at Corning Glass (now Corning Incorporated) in Corning, New York, and preached in his free time. There he founded a church called the Christian Hope Center, and his parishioners were mostly white. \\"We really broke racial barriers for a black man pastoring white people in 1981,\\" he says. =Hope Christian Church= Jackson's work in Corning attracted attention, and he was recruited to Beltsville, Maryland to take over Hope Christian Church. Views on marriage and abortion Jackson believes that same-sex marriage and abortion are morally wrong. He believes that abortion and gay marriage are causing the erosion of the black family, saying \\"I don't know of anybody black who says, 'I hate gay people.' We're more accepting generally. But you overlap that – homosexuality and gay marriage – with broken families, and we don't know how to put it back together,\\" he says. \\"I believe that the Bible teaches that same-sex marriage is an oxymoron,\\" he says. \\"If you redefine marriage, you have to redefine family. You'd have to redefine parenting. I'm looking at the extinction of marriage. And black culture is in a free fall.\\" Jackson has agreed with Pope Benedict XVI's belief that condoms promote AIDS.The Pope Versus AIDS =Activism= Jackson is a prominent activist against same-sex marriage. Jackson began writing about the black family in the late 1990s, and he gained national recognition through his columns for Charisma magazine, in which he frequently wrote about abortion and gay marriage. In 2009, he began leading the movement against legalizing same-sex marriage in Washington, D.C.Seeking to put asunder (Washington Post) A group led by Jackson filed a lawsuit in the District of Columbia after the D.C. Board of Elections refused to allow a ballot initiative on the issue of same-sex marriage, claiming that such an initiative would violate D.C.'s Human Rights Act. In January 2010, the D.C. Superior Court upheld the board's decision. Jackson appealed to the D.C. Court of Appeals, but the court upheld the Superior Court's decision in a 5–4 vote. Jackson then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, but it was rejected without comment in January 2011.Court rejects appeal over D.C. gay marriage law ReferencesExternal links *The Truth in Black & White (the bishop's official website) *Hope Christian Church (the official website of the bishop's congregation) *The Reconciled Church (the office website of the reconciled church) * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:African-American Christians Category:American Christian clergy Category:Living people Category:Protestant bishops Category:American anti- abortion activists Category:Harvard Business School alumni Category:Religious leaders from Cincinnati Category:People from Silver Spring, Maryland Category:People from Beltsville, Maryland Category:Activists from Ohio Category:Williams College alumni ","title":"Harry R.

History The Nupe trace their origin to Tsoede who fled the court of Idah and established a loose confederation of towns along the Niger in the 15th century. The proximity of Nupe to the Yoruba Igbomina people in the south and to the Yoruba Oyo people in the southwest led to cross-fertilization of cultural influences through trade and conflicts over the centuries. Population and demography There are probably about 4.5 million Nupes, principally in Niger State. The Nupe language is also spoken in Kwara, Kogi and Federal Capital Territory. They are primarily Muslims, with a few Christians and followers of African Traditional Religion. The Nupe people have several local, traditional rulers. The Etsu Nupe (Bida) is not pure Nupe, his great grandfather from his father side is Fulani while the family of his mother was complete Nupe. His great grandfather from his father side came to rule the Bida in the 1806. They have no present capital, although they were originally based at Rabah and only moved to Bida in the nineteenth century. Nupe part in Nigeria Traditions, art and culture The Nupe people have various traditions. Many practices have changed as a result of The movements started by Usman Dan Fodio jihad of the 19th century, but they still hold on to some of their culture. Many Nupe people often have scarification on their faces (similar to an old Yoruba tradition), some to identify their prestige and the family of which they belong as well as for protection, as well as jewelry adornment. But these traditions are dying out in certain areas. Their art is often abstract. They are well known for their wooden stools with patterns carved onto the surface. The Nupe were described in detail by the ethnographer Siegfried Nadel, whose book, Black Byzantium, remains an anthropological classic. =Examples of Nupe art= Museum of Ethnology Vienna 007.JPGBurtu wooden mask, used during bird hunting; Museum of Ethnology, Vienna.

It chronicles a young priest's movement away from his religion and toward the environmentalist teachings of an international lecturer known as \\"B\\". The Story of B expands upon many of the philosophical ideas introduced in Quinn's 1992 novel Ishmael, and acts as the spiritual successor to both this book and My Ishmael, also written by Quinn. Plot summary The Story of B is presented as a diary of the American first- person narrator and protagonist, Fr. Jared Osborne, a Roman Catholic priest of the Laurentian order. The Laurentians have traditionally made it their duty to be the first group to recognize the Antichrist. With this mission in mind, an esteemed member of the order, Fr. Bernard Lulfre, personally tasks Jared with investigating an itinerant American lecturer, Charles Atterley, who has gained notable attention in Europe and whose ideas the Laurentians consider a potential danger to humankind. Although told that Atterley was last spotted in Austria, Jared is initially unable to track down the enigmatic preacher. Upon discovering that Atterley is more commonly known to the public as \\"B\\", Jared at last discovers him on a lecture circuit throughout major cities in Germany. Jared begins to attend each of B's speeches and takes verbatim notes that he faxes back to Lulfre. Ultimately pressed for a judgment on the possibility of B's being the Antichrist, Jared is driven to penetrate B's inner circle where he soon finds his religious foundations shaken to their core. Jared meets with and soon gets to know B personally. Although B immediately understands that Jared is a potential threat to himself and his movement, he does not seem to be as suspicious of or cold toward Jared as are the rest of B's cohort, including B's closest companion, the extremely distrusting, lupus-stricken Shirin. Instead, B welcomes Jared and seems legitimately motivated to educate him, even presenting his teachings to Jared one-on-one. Among the tenets of B's philosophy are: an advocacy of new tribalism and the \\"Great Remembering\\"-- which is his idea humanity has forgotten its hunter-gatherer history and should reclaim this forgotten knowledge that once steadily supported humanity's survival--as well as an opposition to \\"totalitarian agriculture\\", the style of agriculture whereby its practitioners destroy all competition and assume all resources are made only for their own use. Jared finds himself logically supporting these and others of B's ideas, though is unable to rationalize them in terms of his religious convictions. On a train after one of B's lectures, Jared stumbles upon the murdered body of B in an empty railroad car. B's followers immediately suspect Jared or his organization. To Jared's surprise, Shirin resumes Atterley's lectures where he left off and claims that she is now B. Even more surprising, she begrudgingly continues to personally tutor Jared in B's philosophy, though she openly calls Jared stupid, not because he lacks the capacity to learn but because she has never seen a person \\"with so much mental equipment being put to so little use\\". Shirin's further teachings include the idea of a Law of Life, the concept that storytelling may be a genetic characteristic of humans, the promotion of animism, and the notion that totalitarian agriculture results in ecological imbalance and over-population, which themselves are rapidly leading to humankind's self-destruction. Jared begins to see how he cannot remain devout to his religion and in agreement with B's teachings simultaneously. The diary abruptly picks up when Jared regains consciousness after surviving a mysterious explosion. In the hospital, Jared attempts to piece together his memories, chronicling that one of B's lecture theatres was bombed, and Shirin and B's inner circle are presumably all dead. Flown back to the United States to recuperate, Jared eventually confronts Fr. Lulfre, from whom he learns that the Laurentian order indeed authorized both Atterley's assassination and the bombing of the theatre. Jared renounces his devotion to the order and returns hastily back to Europe, desperately searching for any information about possible survivors of the bombing and lamenting his lack of knowledge about the people he seeks out, for example, the fact that he never even learned Shirin's last name. Ultimately, Jared recalls that the theatre had a tunnel through which Shirin and the others might have escaped. Visiting the mouth of the tunnel, which is barricaded by wooden planks, Jared finds contact information engraved in the wood. He is later reunited with Shirin and the others, and the memory comes flooding in that he warned them to flee moments before the explosion, thus saving their lives. A brief epilogue explains that Jared and Shirin plan to completely disappear from the public eye together. Moments before Jared must leave to board a plane, he urges the spreading of B's philosophy and writes the final words of his diary: that Charles Atterley, Shirin, he, and the reader, too, are all B. The Teachings of B B's spoken lectures in Germany are fully written out at the end of the book in a roughly 80-page-long appendix called \\"The Public Teachings\\" (with a header on each of the following pages that reads \\"The Teachings of B\\"). Although the main text of the book is written in first-person point of view from Jared’s perspective, the author Quinn's real-life perspective echoes that of B, written in this appendix. The following teachings are from the lectures of B and represent Daniel Quinn’s historically-based ideas of human evolution and the future of human history. =The Great Forgetting= The \\"Great Forgetting\\" is the term B uses to describe an occurrence during the formative millennia of our civilization. What was forgotten is that there was a time when people lived without civilization and were sustained primarily by hunting and gathering rather than by large-scale animal husbandry and agriculture. By the time history began to be written down, thousands of years had passed since abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle and it had been assumed that people had come into existence farming. B argues that our knowledge and worldview today would be greatly altered had the foundation thinkers of our culture known there was history beyond the beginning of civilization. When paleontology uncovered three million years' worth of human generations, making it untenable that humanity, agriculture, and civilization all began at roughly the same time, our worldview was still not affected. Instead, humanity used terms like “pre-history” and “Agricultural Revolution” to label these events, rather than grafting their ramifications into our societal fabric. =Food and population control= A continual theme through B’s teachings is that population growth is dependent upon food production, with increases in food production leading to increases in population. B's (i.e. Quinn's) thinking here should not be confused with the ideas of Thomas Malthus, who made the prediction that population would outrun food supply. In B's own words, \\"Malthus's warning was about the inevitable failure of totalitarian agriculture. My warning is about its continued success.\\"Quinn, Daniel. 1997. The Story of B. New York: Bantam Books. p. 305. Quinn characterizes the Malthusian problem as \\"How are we going to FEED all these people?\\" and contrasts this with his own: \\"How are we going to stop PRODUCING all these people?\\"Quinn, Daniel. 2016. \\"The Question.\\" Ishmael.org. ABCs of ecology To better exemplify his ideas of food production and population control, B introduces the ABCs of Ecology. * Part A: The first part of ecology consists purely of food. Food is best described as all life forms. * Part B: The second part of ecology consists of how populations are affected by the food supply. B explains that population and food supply are in a delicate balance: \\"As food populations increase, feeder populations increase. As feeder populations increase, food populations decrease. As food populations decrease, feeder populations decrease. As feeder populations decrease, food populations increase.\\" =History of humanity since the Great Forgetting= The people of our culture established a style of agriculture that B labels \\"totalitarian agriculture.\\" \\"Prehistoric\\" hunters and gatherers operated according to a worldview that promoted coexistence and limited competition between predator and prey. However, the totalitarian agriculturist operates with the worldview that the world is theirs to control and all the food in the world is theirs to produce and eat. Totalitarian agriculturists, while originally representing a single society, eventually began to overrun other societies as their food supply and populations grew. (B sometimes calls the totalitarian agriculturists \\"Takers,\\" a term first used by Ishmael in the his eponymous novel). B notes that even tribal societies who battle with and claim victory over other ones do not normally force their defeated enemies to assimilate as do the members of our own world-dominating Taker culture. B comments, \\"The Tak [that is, B's name the earliest members of the Taker culture] had the remarkable and unprecedented idea that everyone should live the way they lived. It's impossible to exaggerate how unusual this made them. I can't name a single other [tribalistic] people in history who made it a goal to proselytize their neighbors.\\" Under proliferation of totalitarian agriculture, the world population began to double, first taking 2000 years; then taking 1600 years; and eventually only taking 200 years between 1700 and 1900 AD; then again between 1900 and 1960 AD; and yet again between 1960 and 1996 AD. Over the last 10,000 years, this single society has expanded to include 99.8% of the world’s population. B argues that this exponential growth of the human population is not sustainable. He points to several major problems in our society that he claims arose from over-produced food and an over-crowded population. He states that war, crime, famine, plague, an exploited labor force, drug abuse, slavery, rebellion, and genocide have resulted from Totalitarian Agriculturists' continual expansion. B emphasizes that to reverse the damage we have caused, humankind does not inherently need to change, but rather a single culture has to be changed. =Collapse of culture= B uses the phrase “cultural collapse” to describe the point of history that we are living through today. He believes that circumstances have rendered the cultural mythology of the Takers meaningless to its people. When this happens to a culture, B states, things fall apart. \\"Order and purpose are replaced by chaos and bewilderment. People lose the will to live, become listless, become violent, become suicidal, and take to drink, drugs, and crime... laws, customs and institutions fall into disuse and disrespect, especially among the young, who see that even their elders can no longer make sense of them.\\" =The Great Remembering= During his lectures, B introduces the Great Remembering as this generation’s most needed response to the Great Forgetting. He comments that, because we have already experienced a collapse of culture, our society is ready to abandon our totalitarian agriculture and industrial trends. B uses the examples of tribal cultures as the basis for this new society. He claims that the \\"Great Forgetting blinds us to the fact that we are biological species in a community of biological species and are not exempt or exemptible from the forces that shape all life on this planet.\\" He declares that what was forgotten in the Great Forgetting must be remembered in order for us to recognize \\"that what cannot work for any species will not work for us either.\\" =Tribal societies= B looks to tribal societies as models for future societies because they exhibited 3 million years of societal evolution before being overtaken by the totalitarian agriculturalist. B specifically looks at tribal law as a basis for law in the future. In hunter/gatherer tribes, there are no formal laws, only inherent practices that determine the identity of the tribe. Tribes do not write or invent their laws, but honor codes of conduct that arise from years of social evolution. B rejects the modern idea that there is one set moral standard for people to live by. Instead, he argues that the laws and customs that arise from each tribe are sustainable and “right” in their own way because they work for the tribe. Tribal societies offer a tested-true way for people to live and work today as well as they ever did. B acknowledges that tribes make war on one another, but for a different reason than Taker countries. Taker countries make war to gain resources or expand territory, but a tribe attacks another tribe to remind themselves that they have a tribal identity and that they are different from the other tribe. Again, this is a sustainable model, because little harm is done to either side in the war, tribal boundaries are maintained, and after the brief war, normal relations between tribes are restored. =Salvation= B finally discusses the idea of salvation and the organized institutions in the Taker society that he calls \\"salvationist religions.\\" He states that humans only began to think that they needed saving from humanity (i.e. themselves) because of the historical evolution of war, famine, etc., that resulted from totalitarian agriculture. The need for salvation by a Savior, he argues, like civilization and war, is not inherent to humanity but is a condition created by any human society, such as our own global one, that violates the Law of Life i.e. by practicing totalitarian agriculture. B asserts that humanity and the world do not need spiritual salvation, but, rather, that members of our one particular type of culture need to change their minds and actions if the human species is to survive in the world. B's final comment is that he is indeed, as accusers have said, the Antichrist, or more appropriately: the Antisavior. B calls for followers to abandon the idea that humanity needs to be saved from itself and to tell accusers that \\"we're straying from the path of salvation...but not for love of vice and wickedness as you contemptuously imagined we might. We're straying from the path of salvation for love of the world.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Story of B at the Ishmael Community *Ishthink, An online community discussing issues related to the subjects explored in Ishmael and The Story of B Category:1997 American novels Category:Novels by Daniel Quinn ","title":"The Story of B"},{"id":"2470063","text":"London Leah Tipton is a fictional character in Disney's Suite Life franchise which consists of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody,Disney's The Suite Life of Zack & Cody its spinoff, The Suite Life on Deck,Disney's The Suite Life on Deck and the made-for-TV Suite Life Movie.

TheStarScoop.com. Accessed 2008-12-11. She is the daughter of Wilfred Tipton, the owner of the Tipton Hotel chain and the SS Tipton. Along with Dylan and Cole Sprouse, she has appeared in every episode of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody except for \\"Have a Nice Trip\\" and \\"Birdman of Boston\\", and every episode of The Suite Life on Deck. Background London Tipton is the only child of wealthy businessman Wilfred Tipton. Her mother, who has never been named or seen, is of Thai origin; her father is American, though he claims British citizenship for income tax purposes. She is heiress to the Tipton corporate empire (which includes the Tipton hotel chain and many other companies, including several record labels and a cruise line).The Suite Life of Zack & Cody Episode 1x09: Band in Boston It is revealed in The Suite Life on Deck episode \\"A London Carol\\" that London at one time loved helping people, and that every Christmas she volunteered at homeless shelters. Despite being born into wealth and privilege, London had a very unhappy childhood; her father almost seems to have made a hobby of neglecting her, and remarried so many times that London never felt she had a mother. The Suite Life on Deck reveals that her father married a girl named Karina because London wanted her out of her way of her relationship with a magician on the ship. London herself says that Karina is her father's fourteenth wife. It is also said in the finale of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody that her father has been married a dozen times in the past, though in an episode on The Suite Life on Deck, she stated that he has been married eight times, though this is possibly due to London's ignorance and inability to do math. It is also revealed that London is nearly illiterate, due to her lack of education and neglect. Her father did not attend any of London's special events (not even Christmas) because he was supposedly busy, as revealed by London to Maddie in the episode \\"Lip Synchin' in the Rain.\\" As she grew older, she filled the void created by her father's absence with shopping, as Maddie discovers in the episode \\"Kisses & Basketball\\". Maddie claims that London buys clothes to cope with feelings of emptiness. In The Suite Life on Deck episode \\"The Beauty and the Fleeced\\", London admits to shopping when she is depressed. In the episode \\"The Prince & the Plunger\\", Moseby convinces London to attend the father-daughter dance with Mr. Tipton, though London is convinced her father will not come. After Moseby gets the hotel in perfect condition and hires a band to welcome his boss, he learns that Mr. Tipton is a no-show, as London predicted. Moseby discovers London crying in the linen closet; her tough attitude about her father once again disappointing her is revealed to be a front. Moseby asks London if she would like him to be her escort to the dance, and she agrees. At the age of 15, she met Maddie Fitzpatrick, who eventually becomes her best friend. At one point, London enrolled at Maddie's Catholic school, Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow. Later on in the series, London was expelled because she did not attend her classes, so she is forced to go to Cheevers High School. Then her father has her attend Seven Seas High, a high school program on the SS Tipton, because on a ship, she will not be able to run away. BiographyThe Suite Life of Zack & Cody= London is a very spoiled, selfish, rich teenager with her own private suite at the Tipton Hotel in Boston, complete with floors full of closets (each with its own obsequious talking mirror), and a kitchen that takes up most of the floor. Her best friend is Maddie Fitzpatrick, whom London is essentially bribing to spend time with her. She is also very good friends with Zack and Cody. Though London can often be seen as a superficial snob who looks down on lower-class people, she does make exceptions for those whom she really cares about and has been shown to be loyal to her friends. She loves fashion, and states that she has been wearing designer outfits since she was a baby, and usually never wears the same outfit twice. She has a Pomeranian named Ivana Tipton who is treated like royalty. Since London has no nanny, or any adult to look out for her, she often looks to the Tipton employees for help and/or guidance. She dislikes her stepmothers and talks to Mr. Moseby, Maddie, and sometimes Carey about her problems. When happy, London tends to clap her hands repeatedly and jump up and down while saying her catchphrase, \\"Yay me!\\" Though it seems like London may lead the ultimate extravagant life, her childhood was far from perfect. London has attended several private schools, but shows very little effort in her schoolwork. She transferred to the same private school as Maddie in the episode Forever Plaid, due to poor attendance at her old school (\\"And they even expect me to go on Fridays!\\"). In the episode First Day of High School, London transfers to Zack and Cody's public school, due to being expelled from all of the private schools she had previously attended. London's worst subject in school would probably be language arts, since she doesn't like reading and often claims to have trouble with the alphabet. As stated earlier, London has below average intelligence. She is confused with many things, and is tricked by many characters such as Maddie and Nia. London, apparently, has some belief in certain mythological aspects; Maddie and Esteban once tricked her into doing many idiotic things by changing her horoscope. Though, annoying to some characters, London being gullible is found to be quite an advantage in difficult situations. It is also revealed in one episode that she must think before doing the smallest everyday actions. For example, she was walking through the lobby while thinking \\"left, right, blink, breathe\\" in the episode Super Twins. London's gullibility tends to get the better of herself and it gives others the impression that she's not very bright, as shown in an episode of The Suite Life on Deck when London gullibly believed to be in an actual relationship with herself, even sending herself \\"surprise\\" gifts and then actually being surprised when she receives them, up to the point when she wrote herself a break-up letter and was truly heartbroken when she re-opened and read it a few moments later. Having such a glamorous lifestyle, London also has trouble with anything that involves hard work, which is something her dad encourages her to do sometimes (much to the dismay of London), usually because of her frivolous money spending. London's poor ability is often caused by her lack of effort and understanding, as it's normally easy for her to get her own way in life. Though sometimes she'll put her ego aside, and show she can do more than she's given credit for, which shows her to being occasionally smart and/or selfless. Though curiously, her stupidity seems to have increased during season 3. London has her own web- show, ever since the episode Tiptonline. The original producer of Yay Me, Starring London Tipton was Cody Martin. After Cody quit, due to crazy things London made him do on set, London's friend Chelsea Brimmer became the producer, but Chelsea left after one webshow because she was a horrible producer and the fans demanded they bring Cody back. London then realized how she needed Cody and apologized to him on the air. After Cody saw the show, he rushed to London's suite in the middle of the show and stated that he would return. However, whenever Cody was unavailable, Maddie often filled in as a substitute, and soon became the official producer. London continues to do her webshow on the SS Tipton, with Woody Fink as her producer. She sees her father in person only rarely, but she often talks to him on the telephone. London says that Mr. Moseby appears much more times in her family's photo albums than Mr. Tipton or any of his ex-wives. Although she is not of Jewish descent, London observes Hanukkah. In \\"Big Hair & Baseball\\", while she and Carey swoon as the New York Yankees check into the Tipton, she says of the players, \\"They're even cuter than that hockey team Daddy bought me for Hanukkah\\". In \\"Cookin' with Romeo and Juliet\\", London states that she's used to getting everything she wants on her birthday, Christmas, and Hanukkah. When Maddie points out that London shouldn't be able to celebrate Hanukkah since she isn't Jewish, London replies \\"And miss out on 8 days of presents? Not this Shiksa.\\" Throughout the series, London peppers her speech with other Yiddish vernacular, such as \\"Oy Vey,\\" \\"Plotz,\\" and \\"Mazel Tov.\\" London hates to work out but has been shown to be very strong in several episodes. She is also tone deaf, but still likes to sing. It is revealed in \\"Super Twins\\" she is also easily hypnotized, which is also shown in The Suite Life on Deck. =The Suite Life on Deck= London journeys onto the SS Tipton with the belief that she is on a vacation, until she is informed otherwise by Mr. Moseby that it is for her to attend Seven Seas High (or as London refers to it, \\"stupid sea-school\\") so she can attend school properly without skipping class. London bitterly sees this as more as a punishment than an opportunity. When London finds out later that she has to share a cabin, she bribes her cabin-mate, Padma, with jewelry to leave in \\"The Suite Life Sets Sail\\", so she can have her own cabin. At the end of the episode, Bailey Pickett is revealed to be a girl, which prompts her to be assigned in London's half-vacant cabin. This pushes a stubborn London to escape the SS Tipton via helicopter to Parrot Island, after bribing an employee. Therefore, in the following episode, the ship makes a special journey to the island to rescue her, as she has been imprisoned because Tipton Industries cut down Parrot Island's trees, which made the native parrots immigrate to Seal Island close by. Later, she writes a check for $10 million to rehabilitate the island, and resumes residence on the SS Tipton. At the school, London is treated like a regular student. In order to skid her way through school, London has often tried to bribe the teacher (such as handing in a blank report with $100 bills on each page). However, she has been seen putting a little more effort into her school work, and even states in the episode \\"Sea Monster Mash\\" that she enjoys having a feeling of accomplishment. London is also slightly smarter than what she was in The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, as seen in multiple episodes (though she still retains the ditzy demeanor). Also despite her frequent attempts to escape the SS Tipton so she can resume her normal free life, London has found ways to adapt on the ship. Since London now has limited closet space in her cabin, it is mentioned that most of her clothes are carried by a submarine that follows the ship, though she continues to find more room. London quickly establishes a tenuous friendship with Bailey. In Broke N' Yo-Yo, she moves Bailey to a cramped loft near the ceiling of the cabin, and Bailey retaliates by faking an attack of fictional \\"Sea Snarks\\", but eventually comes clean and they agree to share the cabin equally. London later reunites with Ivana, her dog, flown in by a helicopter in The Kidney of the Sea, and Cody referees an intelligence competition between her dog and Bailey's pet, Porkers the pig, but in the end Ivana and Porkers end in a draw. London occasionally mistreats Bailey such as humiliating her using her webshow, \\"Yay Me\\" on a segment called \\"Boo You\\". Despite this, London means well as a friend and Bailey is willing to forgive her. Although London admits that she doesn't \\"do things for other people\\", she has often attempted to do many generous things, with unfortunate results. In \\"Mom and Dad On Deck\\", she hoped to find Moseby the perfect gift for his birthday, but resulted in her annoyingly following him everywhere in order to find out what he likes. She even tried to nurse Moseby after he got injured slipping on the sky deck, but only ends up making him feel crowded. In the same episode, it is revealed that it takes her half-an-hour to read one page in even the simplest books (she reads 'The Pokey Little Princess' to Moseby, and her problem is revealed). In the season two episode \\"Smarticle Particles\\", Bailey tricks London into doing well in school by giving her a \\"smart perfume\\" (as a placebo), to which London responds to as planned. However, London finds out later that the perfume is fake, and is upset that her 'smarticles' weren't real, and she states while crying that she can't be smart now, and that she likes \\"being smart\\" Bailey then cheers her up with a \\"smart lipstick\\", which London happily uses. This shows that London is actually very bright but lacks enough confidence to believe so. But other instances conclude that she doesn't know very much at all (e.g., in \\"Marriage 101\\", when she's mentioned the number of her father's marriages she holds up six fingers, though clearly saying \\"eight\\"). In \\"Family Thais\\", the gang travels to Thailand, where London meets her grandmother, and at first is upset, and disgusted after finding out that she was a farmer. In \\"Lost at Sea\\", London pretends to go insane and that she's on an island resort in order not to have to do any work. After they finally escape the island in a balloon made out of her clothes and fly back to the SS Tipton, she reveals her deception and makes Cody and Bailey acknowledge she's a lot smarter than they give her credit for. She is also seen to be precise with her hands, such as when she repaired a small boat with various eyebrow care products in \\"Cruisin' for a Bruisin'\\". In the season three episode \\"Silent Treatment\\", after Bailey is ready to go onto the Sky Deck carrying a cat in a dress, London snaps Bailey out of her depression after her breakup with Cody by calling Bailey young, smart and pretty, which she responds to in shock. In \\"My Oh Maya\\", London pretends to be Zack's ex- girlfriend to help him get a girl and pretends to be Marcus' wife to get Dante (Marcus' identity thief) off the ship. It isn't revealed whether or not she did it for free but it can be assumed that because she is maturing she did it without cost. Since then she has been displaying continuous signs of attraction towards Zack. In the last episode, it was shown she would miss Mr. Moseby, since he was the one that raised her. London Tipton's last line in the series is \\"Little me, off to Paris\\", in a French accent, apparently trying to sound rich, smart, and sophisticated. This line mirrored her first ever line in the original series \\"Little me, back from Paris\\". Family *Yolanda (unseen) - One of London's former stepsisters. In \\"Poor Little Rich Girl\\", London called her on her cell phone, looking for a place to sleep. Yolanda refuses because London never helped her. London refers to her as 'sis'. *Khun Yai (played by Elizabeth Sung) - London's grandmother and Mrs. Tipton's mother from Thailand. London visits her in the On Deck episode \\"Family Thais\\", where London is surprised to find out that her grandmother is a poor rice farmer. London tries to connect with her grandmother by giving Khun Yai a makeover and redesigning her hut with expensive furniture and appliances. However, Khun Yai is uncomfortable with all the luxuries, which confuses London. After talking with Bailey, London learns to accept her grandmother's lifestyle and the two share a close bond unlike any relationship London has with the rest of her family. Khun Yai also has a pet elephant who she can understand well, similar to London's relationship with Ivana. =Father= *Wilfred Tipton (voiced by Bob Joles in The Suite Life of Zack & Cody; played by John Michael Higgins in The Suite Life on Deck) - The owner of the Tipton hotel and father to London. His face had never been shown until the third part of the Twister trilogy. He is most commonly seen surrounded by his bodyguards and usually only his hand is shown. In \\"Not so Suite 16\\", his body and legs were shown, but his face was hidden by a large birthday present. It is not clear how he became the owner of the Tipton, because London mentions many times that her father bought the hotel while, in a few episodes, it is said that Tipton's ancestors owned the hotel before he did. Wilfred rarely sees London in person. He often wishes for London to have a better work-ethic in school. He also hopes for her to learn the proper value of money; he often threatens to have her dis-inherited. His hand was once seen in the episode \\"Lip Synchin' in the Rain\\" in which he was wearing a diamond ring. Wilfred Tipton has a history of marrying much younger women without London's consent, most of whom do not last long. In fact, Mr. Moseby once mentioned that the warranty on at least two of the wedding gifts he had given to Mr. Tipton lasted longer than the marriages. In \\"Twister: Part III\\", Mr. Tipton arrives on Kettlecorn to discuss providing financial aid for them after a tornado caused them damage. Later in the same episode he buys the Pickett's farm which he later returns to its rightful owners. =Mothers= *Mrs. Tipton (unseen) - London's mother and Mr. Tipton's third ex-wife. Divorced from Mr. Tipton and remarried, she visited London's sweet sixteen party but remains unseen. According to London, she never stays in one place for long. Nothing more has been said about her. According to Mr. Moseby, she has extremely strong arms. In \\"Twister: Part 3\\", she was said to be Mr. Tipton's third wife. *Stepmother 1 (unseen) - Mr. Tipton's fourth ex-wife. She thought she and Mr. Tipton would be together for a long time. *Stepmother 2 (unseen) - Mr. Tipton's fifth ex-wife. She believed she and Mr. Tipton were soul mates. They were divorced and remarried. *Louise Tipton (Stepmother 3) (unseen) - Mr. Tipton's sixth ex-wife. She was with Mr. Tipton for the shortest time. She refers to London as \\"that kid\\" and London refers to her as \\"that woman\\". She was mentioned in \\"A London Carol\\", where London said she only hugged her once just to pick her pocket. *Stepmother 4 (unseen) - Mr. Tipton's seventh ex-wife. *Brandi Tipton (Stepmother 5) (played by T Lopez) - Mr. Tipton's eighth ex-wife seen in The Suite Life of Zack & Cody episode \\"What the Hey\\". She was Mr. Tipton's assistant. She comes to visit London, but they do not get along well. Over the course of the episode they become friendlier to each other. As pointed out by Mr. Moseby, Brandi, out of all the stepmothers, has been shown to have the most concern for London. They were remarried and redivorced. In \\"Mr. Tipton Comes To Visit\\", it is suggested that he has remarried when London says \\"All 12 of Daddy's wedding cakes have been that flavor (German Chocolate)\\". *Stepmother 6 (unseen) - Mr. Tipton's ninth ex-wife. Mr. Moseby revealed that he was the best man at their wedding in \\"Twister Part 3\\". *Stepmother 7 (unseen) - Mr. Tipton's tenth ex-wife. She was Mr. Tipton's assistant. *Stepmother 8 (unseen) - Mr. Tipton's eleventh ex- wife. *Stepmother 9 (unseen) - Mr. Tipton's twelfth ex-wife. *Stepmother 10 (unseen) - Mr. Tipton's thirteenth ex-wife. London refers to her as \\"Mommy #11\\". *Stepmother 11 (unseen) - Mr. Tipton's fourteenth ex-wife. London refers to her as \\"Mommy #12\\". *Stepmother 12 (unseen) - Mr. Tipton's fifteenth ex- wife. *Karina Tipton (Stepmother 13) (played by Briana Lane) - Mr. Tipton's sixteenth ex-wife. She appears in the episode \\"Ala-ka-scram!\\" on The Suite Life on Deck as the magician's assistant. London and Armando start dating, so London gets jealous of Karina and tells her dad to \\"get rid of her\\", but he marries her instead. *Stepmother 14 (unseen) - Mr. Tipton's seventeenth ex- wife. *Stepmother 15 (unseen) - Mr. Tipton's eighteenth ex-wife. *Stepmother 16 (unseen) - Mr. Tipton's nineteenth ex-wife. *Stepmother 17 (unseen) - Mr. Tipton's twentieth ex-wife. *Stepmother 18 (unseen) - Mr. Tipton's current wife. =Friendships= *Marion Moseby (Phill Lewis) is almost like a father to London. He often gives London support and good advice, and it has been mentioned that he has taken care of London since she was very young. As London states, he is in her family album much more than her dad or any of his ex- wives. He helped London take her first steps across the lobby of the Tipton Hotel, and also taught her how to drive. The two have a very close bond. *Maddie Fitzpatrick (Ashley Tisdale) is London's best friend and they always hang out with each other. They are shown to have a very close bond, yet London is still not above putting down Maddie's taste in clothes and hair, often exaggerating just because of the difference on their economic status. London often refers to Maddie as \\"hideous hair Maddie\\", which Maddie doesn't enjoy. Maddie serves as London's conscience and voice of reason, but also sometimes takes advantage of her wealth and is shown to be sarcastic with London's intelligence. *Bailey Pickett (Debby Ryan) - London's close friend, introduced in The Suite Life on Deck. They both attend Seven Seas High and are cabin- mates. Though London did not like her at first (she did not want a cabin- mate), they have since become friends. A bone of contention is tales of Bailey's large family, which the parentally-ignored London often envies. *Zack and Cody Martin (Dylan and Cole Sprouse) London maintains a close friendship with the twins. Cody is her web caster and often helps her with difficult homework assignments, and London often gets mixed up in Zack's various schemes. *Woody Fink (Matthew Timmons) - Cody's cabin-mate in The Suite Life on Deck. *Marcus Little (Doc Shaw) - Zack's cabin-mate, former singing sensation, previously known as 'Lil' Little', who leaves the ship to star in a Broadway show in New York City. *Nia Moseby (Giovonnie Samuels) - Moseby's niece and Maddie's temporary replacement at the Tipton during season 3. She and London have an interesting friendship, in which Nia takes advantage of London's wealth and sometimes gets her involved in a few of her schemes, which London never seems to notice. London refers to her as 'Cranky Maddie'. *Ivana (voiced by Emma Stone) is London's pomeranian dog, who is treated like royalty. She is seen in an episode that she can contact London with her cellphone. *Chelsea Brimmer (Brittany Curran) is one of London's wealthy friends. She is just as air-headed as London. First seen in Miniature Golf, and a guest star and former producer on London's web-show, Yay Me. She visited London on the S.S. Tipton in the episode, Flowers and Chocolate of The Suite Life on Deck. *Tiffany (Alexa Nikolas) another one of London's friends. She is shallow, air-headed, and diet-prone. First seen in Miniature Golf. *Portia Tanenbaum (unseen) - A friend of London's who's mentioned many times. She has her own webshow similar to London and gave to charity on one occasion. They usually go on shopping trips to Paris. In the episode Cody Goes to Camp, London says that Portia's going to teach her how to drive. Mr. Moseby nixes this by mentioning that Portia drove her father's yacht into piers 10, 11 and 12. London defends this saying, \\"She was putting on sunscreen.\\" When London searches the name 'Portia Tanenbaum' on the Internet, Cody tells London that she has more results than London. Then London decides to start her own web show called Yay Me! starring London Tipton!. It is apparent that London has fierce rivalry with Portia and considers her an enemy instead of a real friend. *Francesca Grubman (Georgina Rosso) - Seen in the episode Health and Fitness, is one of London's rich friends. She attends London's junior fashion show in the episode, and frequently insults London and Maddie. Georgina Rosso, who portrays Francesca, is the older sister of Rebecca and Camilla Rosso, the twins that portray Jessica and Janice. *Maya Bennett (Zoey Deutch) - Zack's ex-girlfriend. *Addison (Rachael Kathryn Bell) - Classmate in The Suite Life on Deck. *Arturo Vitali (Todd Sherry) - London's favorite fashion designer. Although mentioned frequently in the series (London is constantly wearing his clothes and accessories), he makes just one appearance, in The Suite Life on Deck Season 3 episode \\"Frozen.\\" Ivana Ivana Priscilla Veronica Tipton- Fitzpatrick is a character on the Disney Channel sitcom The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and The Suite Life on Deck. She is voiced by Emma Stone and her Greek voice is provided by Sofia Tsaka in the episode \\"Crushed\\". Ivana is the pet dog of The Tipton Hotel heiress London Tipton. She is a Pomeranian breed although Estaban calls her a Shih Tzu. She does not talk to the human characters, but communicates to Maddie's dog Scamp, who she will have puppies with and marry. However, Maddie Fitzpatrick herself treats Ivana as a real person in one episode when she takes care of Ivana for a day. In this case, she was given sub-titles and barked, unlike how she talks to Scamp (although Maddie reacted, it is unknown whether or not she was actually understood). There was a book about Ivana in one episode, called Ivana lives in a Hotel. London copied it from Maddie for a short story assignment and gets an 'A', and in the end it becomes apparent that Maddie spoke it from a book her mother used to read to her when she was little. When Ivana has puppies with Maddie's dog Scamp, Maddie names her puppy Scruffy and London names hers Prince Percival Persimmon Du Loc. London looked down on Scamp, who had to stay at The Tipton Hotel because Maddie's house was being fumigated, and set Ivana up with a \\"fancy pants\\" White Pomeranian duke, named Lord Quorckeran, (whom Ivana wasn't fond of, despite what London thought). Until Scamp showed up and whisked Ivana to suite 25. Esteban had been secretly feeding them, and stated \\"they are in love\\". When Moseby was showing the Ambassador to \\"his\\" suite, the dogs were found out. London eventually saw that Ivana was happy with Scamp. They ended up having four puppies: Maddie's (Scruffy), London's (Prince Percival Percimmon Du Loc), Esteban's (Maria Consuela Margarita Fransesca DeCielo), and Moseby's unnamed puppy, it is unknown if Mr. Moseby's puppy is a boy or girl. Apparently Ivana is aware of London's lack of intellect, stating, when London thought she liked the Pomeranian Duke, \\"you also think one and one is four\\", although it isn't surprising that Ivana is smarter than London. In \\"Footlooser\\", Esteban said \\"She's making you give her Shih Tzu a shiatsu\\" even though Ivana is a Pomeranian. She is often seen in the first season, but not as much in the later seasons. In \\"Poor Little Rich Girl\\", Ivana is unseen but Zack and Cody said they took her to Doggy Day Care. Ivana returns in \\"The Kidney of the Sea\\" on The Suite Life on Deck being dropped in by a helicopter and helps clear Zack's name after being blamed for stealing the kidney of the sea. In the episode \\"The Defiant Ones\\", she is mentioned. It is possible that she was named after former Czech fashion model and businesswoman Ivana Trump. Reception The show's breakout character, London Tipton has garnered much media recognition. Song became a household name after The Suite Life of Zack & Cody debuted in 2005. In an April 2009 andPOP.com article, they stated that as London Tipton \\"Song is the One to Steal the Spotlight\\" on the Disney Channel. They said: \\"If you ever watched an episode of ‘The Suite Life with Zack & Cody’ you should realize that show is watchable because of one character: London Tipton.

(1977) The Penguin Dictionary of Decorative Arts. London: Allen Lane, p. 800. Pottery decorated using the technique is known as transferware or transfer ware. It was developed in England from the 1750s on, and in the 19th century became enormously popular in England, though relatively little used in other major pottery-producing countries. The bulk of production was from the dominant Staffordshire pottery industry. America was a major market for English transfer-printed wares, whose imagery was adapted to the American market; several makers made this almost exclusively. The technique was essential for adding complex decoration such as the Willow pattern to relatively cheap pottery, but the ease with which very detailed images could be used rather went to the head of early-19th-century potters, who tended to produce dense overcrowded designs that, though very evocative of their period, are in questionable taste. Earlier and later wares show more restrained designs. In particular, transfer printing brought the price of a matching dinner service low enough for large numbers of people to afford. Apart from pottery, the technique was used on metal, and enamelled metal, and sometimes on wood and textiles. It remains used today, although mostly superseded by lithography. In the 19th century methods of transfer printing in colour were developed. Process The process starts with an engraved metal printing plate similar to those used for making engravings or etchings on paper. The plate is used to print the pattern on tissue paper, using mixes of special pigments that stand up to firing as the \\"ink\\". The transfer is then put pigment-side down onto the piece of pottery, so that then sticky ink transfers to the ceramic surface. Usually, several different transfer sections were needed for each piece if the design covered the whole object (see illustration). The paper is either floated off by soaking the piece in water, or left to burn off during the firing. This can be done over or under the ceramic glaze, but the underglaze (\\"underprinting\\") method gives much more durable decoration. The ceramic is then glazed (if this had not been done already) and fired in a kiln to fix the pattern. With overglaze printing only a low-temperature firing was needed. The process produces fine lines similar to engraved prints.Honey, 6–7; Savage, 30 Before transfer printing ceramics were hand painted, a laborious and costly process. Transfer printing enabled the high quality of representation that had been developed in painting on porcelain to be done far more cheaply, in the process making large numbers of painters redundant. Initially, it was also mostly used on porcelain, but after a few years it was also used on the new high-quality earthenwares that English potters had been developing, such as creamware and pearlware.Battie, 117 By the end of the 18th century, a variant technique giving \\"bat-printed\\" wares was introduced. This used \\"pliable glue bats or slabs\\" of a rubbery texture instead of the paper. The plate printed glue onto the bat, which was then transferred to the piece, and powdered pigments were then added, which stuck to the glue. The technique was associated with the introduction of stippling rather than line engraving as the technique used on the copper plates.Godden, 44 The process was much more complicated, and little used after about 1820.Honey, 7; \\"Bat-Printed Porcelain\\", Regency World =Colour= Tile designed by Walter Crane, c. 1890, made in Wheeling, West Virginia. Both these techniques printed a single colour, which was most often the cobalt blue that had been heavily used for painting pottery for centuries. Its success was because the colour was attractive, and cobalt kept its colour in firing even at very high porcelain temperatures. Initially cobalt blue, black and brown were probably the only colour options for underglaze transfer printing. Transfer printing could be supplemented with colour added by hand, or gilding, and this technique was used from early on. The use of multiple transfers, each with a different colour, was introduced quite early when different areas were printed in each colour, for example, a plate with the centre in one colour, and the border in another. It was more difficult to build up a full polychrome image, but this was perfected by Messrs F&R; Pratt of Fenton in the 1840s.Godden, 44 ;gallery; all pieces Staffordshire pottery unless otherwise stated File:DAR pot - IMG 8595.JPGTeapot with scene of a fortune-teller.

Early scenes, mostly relatively small and on larger pieces occupying only the centre of the piece, included genteel or pastoral couples or small groups, landscapes, classical ruins, ships and portraits, especially of the military heroes of the Seven Years' War of 1756–63. All these came from the existing repertoire of china painting, with scenes from Aesop the most popular literary references. Transfer-printed English wares are recorded in New York by 1776, and North America became an important market. By this time transfer-printing on the refined earthenwares such as creamware had become common. Large numbers of designs celebrated the new republic and in particular George Washington, with elaborate decorations around the central image as the century came to an end.  History Italy= Although England dominated the history of commercial transfer printing, the technique had first been used in Italy. A few maiolica pieces, probably from around Turin, mix printed and painted elements in their decoration. They date to the late 17th century, or possibly the early 18th; four surviving pieces are known. Between about 1749 and 1752, just at the time of the earliest English printeds, the Doccia porcelain factory near Florence also used transfer printing. They also experimented with stencils, and some pieces mix these techniques. About 50 pieces are known to survive.\\"Early Italian Ceramic Printing\\", Printed British Pottery and Porcelain =England= Battersea enamel, Venus Begging Arms From Vulcan, 1753-56 In the 1750s three men made significant advances in the application of printed decoration to ceramic surfaces; it does not seem likely that they were aware of the Italian precedents. Most early uses were on expensive porcelain wares, in contrast to the 19th century, when it was much more used on earthenwares. Initially, all pieces were overglaze printed. A single Chelsea porcelain plate survives in the British Museum, which has a transfer-printed design and the \\"raised anchor\\" form of the Chelsea mark, indicating a date between 1750 and 1752. A Swiss enamel artist also records seeing printing being done at an unidentified factory near to (but different from) the Chelksea works, during a visit to London that ended in late 1752.\\"Overglaze Printing on English Porcelain: the beginnings\\" In 1751 John Brooks, an Irish engraver then based in Birmingham, petitioned for a patent for “printing, impressing, and reversing upon enamel and china from engraved, etched and mezzotinted plates and from cuttings on wood and metal...” He was primarily concerned with printed decoration on enamels – boxes, plaques, medallions, etc. His patent application failed and he moved from Birmingham to London where he continued to unsuccessfully apply for patents. He was involved in early printing on enamels at Battersea in London, and probably Bilston near Birmingham.Honey, 7; Savage, 30 Printing on enamel probably began around 1753 (a letter of Horace Walpole dated 7 September 1755 mentions a printed Battersea box), and by around 1756 his process was being used on some Bow porcelain, although the results were not excellent, perhaps as the glaze was \\"too soft and fusible\\", giving a tendency to blur the image. The colours of the 1750s were a \\"purplish or brownish black\\" or a \\"beautiful warm brick-red\\". By around 1760 there was some underglaze printing in blue.Honey, 7, 116–121, 120 quoted; Savage, 30 Blowing Soap Bubbles, about 1760-1770, Staffordshire, salt-glaze earthenware. Five years after Brooks's first patent attempt, in 1756,Hildyard, Robin. (1999) European Ceramics. London: V&A; Publications, p. 90. John Sadler (in partnership with Guy Green) claimed in a patent affidavit that they had spent the past seven years perfecting a process for printing on tiles and that they could \\"print upwards of Twelve hundred Earthen Ware Tiles of different patterns \\" within a period of 6 hours. Sadler and Green printed in Liverpool, where their trade included overglaze printing on tin-glazed earthenware, porcelain, and creamware.Honey, 295–296 Transfer printing on porcelain at the Worcester porcelain factory in the 1750s is usually associated with Robert Hancock, an etcher and engraver, who signed some pieces and had also worked for Bow. Richard and Josiah Holdship, the managers of Worcester, were very supportive and involved with Hancock's work. By the mid-1750s the Worcester factory was producing both underglaze prints in blue and overglaze prints, predominately in black.Dawson, 172–192; Honey, 7, 118, 220–224 Some printed pieces were in complicated shapes and included gilding, showing that the technique was at this point regarded as suitable for luxury products.Dawson, 186 From 1842 the United Kingdom Patent Office introduced a system of registered marks, usually impressed or printed on the underside of pieces. Transfer-printed designs were easily registered by submitting the transfers printed on paper./mark/reg.htm The Potteries, \\"Ceramic Marks\\" The technology of transfer printing spread to Asia as well. Kawana ware in Japan developed in the late Edo period and was a type of blue-and-white porcelain. Manufacturers Major 19th- or 20th-century English manufacturers include Crown Ducal, Enoch Wood & Sons, Royal Staffordshire, Royal Crownford, Alfred Meakin (Tunstall), Spode, Johnson Brothers, and Mason's. The process was popular in other countries including Germany.

Election to legislature Cameron was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1920 provincial election, in the constituency of Winnipeg. At the time, Winnipeg elected ten members via a single transferable ballot. Cameron finished fourth on the first count, and was declared elected on the thirty-third count. The Liberal Party won a minority government in this election, and Cameron served as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's government for the next two years. Running for re-election in the 1922 campaign, Cameron finished eighth on the first count but fell behind on transfers, and placed eleventh on the final ballot. He ran again in the 1927 election, but finished fifteenth on the first count and was eliminated on the nineteenth count. Cameron tried again to return to the legislature in the 1932 campaign, as a supporter of the newly formed Liberal- Progressive alliance. He fared poorly, finishing in twenty-fourth place on the first count. He was eliminated on the eighth count. Death He died in Toronto at the age of 83.

The East Saharan montane xeric woodlands is an ecoregion of central Africa, a number of high mountains in the middle of the huge area of savanna on the edge of the Sahara Desert. Location and description The ecoregion covers the higher elevations of the Ennedi Plateau and the Ouaddaï Highlands of eastern Chad and the extinct volcano system Jebel Marra in Darfur, western Sudan. These mountain ranges rise above the semi- desert sahelian Acacia savanna at the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. The ecoregion covers an area of . The summer rains are irregular, even more so in Chad than on Jebel Marra, which has two crater lakes. Flora Plant life includes many species typical of the sahel belt including Ammania gracilis, the grass Panicum laetum, the forb Chrozophora brocchiana and the herbs Farsetia stenoptera, Indigofera senegalensis and Tephrosia gracilipes. One classic element of the natural flora was Laperrine's Olive (Olea europaea laperrinei). Fauna Water from mountain streams makes the area an important habitat for wildlife such as a numbered of threatened antelope species such as addax (Addax nasomaculatus), Dama gazelle (Gazella dama), Dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas) and Red-fronted gazelle (Gazella rufifrons). Endemic species include the Arid Thicket Rat (Grammomys aridulus) from Jebel Marra. The mountains are home to birds of both Eurasia and Africa, species include Nubian bustard (Neotis nuba) and Cinereous Vulture (Aegypius monachus). Threats and preservation Jebel Marra has been inhabited since antiquity and although the steep mountain valley areas are mainly uninhabited and undisturbed, habitat on the more accessible slopes has been affected. In Chad the ecoregion is thinly populated, mainly by nomadic pastoralists. Recent conflict in both Chad and Darfur have meant that less agriculture is taking place and to an extent original flora is reestablishing.

They speak the Nyakyusa language, a member of the Bantu language family. In 1993 the Nyakusa population was estimated to number 1,050,000, with 750,000 living in Tanzania and 300,000 in Malawi. Nyakyusa are marked as highly educated and eager agriculturists . The Nyakyusa are colonising people where success and survival depended on individual effort. Nyakyusa have managed to collect vast wealth from trade and agriculture than any tribe in Tanzania . Historically, they were called the 'Ngonde' below the Songwe River in British Nyasaland, and 'Nyakyusa' above the river in German territory. The two groups were identical in language and culture, so much so that the Germans referred to the Nyakyusa region above the Songwe River and its people as 'Konde', at least until 1935. HistoryOrigins= According to their oral history they traced their roots to an Ancient Nubian Queen called Nyanseba, She was abducted by a warrior and a herdsmen, it is said the herdsmen turned the rulership of Empresses to Emperors, but the power and influence of women among the Nyakyusa can be seen through in their traditions the Boys take their mother’s clan name while the girls take their father’s clan name. =Colonial history= The Scots had founded Karonga in 1875. In 1889, the treaties of Harry Johnston reduced the state of regular war between the Konde Chiefs and the Arabs. In 1895 the British hanged Mlozi, a slave trader. Finally the area was incorporated as 'British Central Africa', with Karonga itself fortified with palisades on the lake and defended on the other three sides with trenches, which could be swept from brick bastions. Gates protected the trenches of the fort with two cannons, one Norden field machine-gun, and 300 to 400 armed inhabitants, who were ready even during peacetime. Administrators and warehouses were to be found inside—the houses of the inhabitants were outside—within their own palisades, protected by the guns of the fort. It is said that slave raids were conducted almost within sight of Karonga, leaving the Nyakyusa and others uncertain as to whether or not to support Mlozi or a European power. Three hundred to five hundred warriors finally supported England. Karonga was important as England's main support base for the 'Stephenson Road', from Lake Nyasa to Lake Tanganyika, which by 1892 was already falling apart due to a lack of funds. In contrast to the Ngonde in the south, the Nyakyusa were unsophisticated and isolated from contact with the outside world, had unfortified villages, little to do with the ivory trade, slavery, or Arabs, or anything east of the effectively protective Livingston Mountains, and kept their over one hundred small chiefdoms independent, at least until the arrival of the Europeans. Being warriors, they were able to repeatedly repulse the attacks of the Sangu of Merere and the Ngoni. =European accounts= European travelers, being strongly impressed with cleanliness and neatness, seem to have found it north of Lake Nyasa. Joseph Thomson, in To the Central African Lakes and Back (1881), comes close to describing the Nyakyusa, \\"It seemed a perfect Arcadia.... Imagine a perfectly level plain, from which all weeds, garbage, and things unsightly are carefully cleared away. Dotted here and there are a number of immense shady sycamores with branches almost as large as a separate tree. Every few spaces are charmingly neat circucular huts, with conical roofs, and walls hanging out all round with the clay worked prettily into rounded bricks, and daubed symmetrically with spots. (These have always been considered normal and typical, but due to the German 'hut tax' the rectangular huts began to dominate) The grass thatching is also very neat. The 'tout ensemble' renders these huts a place in any nobleman's garden.\\" Merensky, in Deutsch Arbeit am Nyaßa, quotes a missionary: \\"We wandered through magnificent banana groves and elegant, cleanly built huts of our Nyakyusa. When one contemplates the people it appears as though they celebrated a festival every day. They look as clean as though they knew no work. One sees women and children picking fallen fruit from the ground while men and young people walk mostly hand in hand.... The entire image gives a charming picture, really more lovely than words can express.\\" Missionary Richard is quoted in much the same way. \\"One could imagine being in a garden on Lake Geneva.\\" Quoting Major von Wissmann, \\"They are as happy as Africans can be...modest, hospitable, and have until now been able to keep dangerous enemies off of their necks and keep their independence.\\" The film Mother Night is set among the Chaga and Nyakyusa people of Africa, and claims to be based on the funereal rituals of these tribes. At his father's death, the protagonist, Danny, is required by custom to have sex with all seven of his widowed stepmothers in one night. Konde Revolt By 1897 the Germans were no longer happy with their status in East Africa and we have what can be called the Konde Revolt of 1897, the three cornered dispute between the military, missionaries and the Nyakyusa with some Kinga, including the involvement of German Safari Conductor Bauer. Zugführer Bauer was personally acquainted with Baron v. Eltz, and almost all of the missionaries in the area, and at least some of the Chiefs. Almost everyone knew Bauer but few knew his rank. (Even Charsley in his book lists him as a lieutenant.) Von Eltz, who had no Askari available, decided to cede the administration of justice to missionaries in 'trifles and punishment', forcing affairs to really hit the fan on December 2, 1893, with Lutheran Missionary Schumann writing, \\"Five cattle have been stolen by Muambeneke on the Rungue- Mountain. I have tried to influence Muambeneke, with however, no results.\\" Missionary Schumann continues, \\"On December 23, 1893 a different chief had also stolen cattle but is said...in the process of returning them. Muambeneke refuses to return his stolen cattle etc. saying he does not even know the 'White' (Elz) in Rumbira (Langenburg), maybe you wish the cattle etc. etc.... May I point out that the protectorate forces have not yet introduced themselves as the higher judiciary to the black population, there is no present concept of the difference between the protectorate forces and the missionaries. In the eyes of the inhabitants they are one and the same.\\" (this last probably refers to Bauer.) \\"I (Schumann) have even been accused of judging with a gun in my hand.\\" August 8, 1894 Zugführer Bauer writes that Häuptling Makiemba said, \\"If one wanted somethingh from him than the Germans should come to him for he was afraid of Nyassa (Lake?). On the other hand if we wanted war he was ready\\". Governor Scheele writes \\"...Provisionally no company is to be sent there...\\". Finally in October 1894 Bauer reports taking cattle away from Chief Masakiwande and burning the village down because of cattle theft and even though many inhabitants brought their grievances to him to be adjudicated he could find none to act as porters and in the confusion ten Askari were forced to drag Bauer's loads to the mission Manow. As Bauer listened to their complaints they abruptly dismissed him. On November 5, 1894 he (Bauer) reports, \\"Muarukwa was not in agreement with the return of 10 cattle saying the Europeans in Langenburg had nothing to do with it\\". The issue ended as Bauer burned down this village and taking away the cattle, thereby killing five men and three women. The situation is completely out of hand by 1897 with Chief Makelimba having two Askari 'murdered' on February 5, with Bauer barely getting away (knapper Not Davon) and by December 1897, following Bauer' departure for Germany (he may have smelled trouble coming) the Nyakusa and some of the Kinga chiefs had gotten together to rid the land of all missionaries and other whites. The German authorities were late in learning of the plot from the missionaries who had not pass the information on. Lt. Alpons claimed he went with a troop of forty-five Askari who were then ambushedby more than two thousand Konde (Hehe style), who being certain of victory did not use their spears, for they wanted to strip Alpons naked and put a copper ring on his head for taunting them for their nakedness, wishing to have the konde working, buying cloth, earning money, and probably paying taxes, the Konde were defeated by superior firepower. Missionary Maaß reported seeing roughly 30 dead Konde in just one area. The entire revolt seems to have been blamed on Lt. Alpons and Missionary Cristoph Bunk of the Lutheran Missionary Gesellschaft for not having notified the military. The missionaries claimed Lt. Alpons had deliberately provoked the Konde. As a result Missionry Bunk was transferred to Ubena and Lt. Alpons was recalled as district commander. Culture and society Collectively, the Nyakyusa are traditionally thought of as being related to the Kinga of the Livingston Mountains, who had themselves spread westwards as immigrants. 'Nobles', ruling the land, were credited with divine powers, lived in strict religious seclusion, their chiefs (Princes), being strangled by their councillors in old age or illness in order to maintain rain, fertility, and the health of the village. The chief's advisers were never his kinsmen, but only non-hereditary commoners with considerable power over the chief. The Nyakyusa were a colonizing people where success and survival depended on individual effort. According to M. Wilson slavery was reported as being totally unknown in 1892, although the slave trade certainly existed in the vicinity of the Konde of Karonga. They lived in very small chiefdoms, not in groups of relatives, but in groups of age-mates attempting to live in harmony to avoid misfortune. The Nyakyusa were eager agriculturists. They practiced intensive crop rotation with corn, beans, squash, sorghum, millet, yams, etc., with banana plantations stretching for miles. Clearing and hoeing the land three to four hours a day was the responsibility of the men and his sons, never the women. The crops were used for food, beer, and hospitality, as well as for sale and barter. Neither old age nor high status excused a man from his duty to hoe. They were said to fear leaving their area for concern of being unable to exist without their accustomed food of meat, milk, bananas etc. Each year at the beginning of the rainy season, the Nyakyusa assemble at a place called 'Chikungu' where their chief Kyungu calls for rain. All villagers are told not to light fire in their homes in the morning of the ritual rain-calling ceremony. All the villagers wait for the sacred fire from the shrine called moto ufya to be distributed. Arbitration in disputes by a friend or neighbor is considered very important. The headman or prince had no power to enforce decisions and while there was no attempt to quiet a quarrel it is considered most proper to arrive at a settlement through some group opinion of equals, established before adolescence, resting on friendship, assistance, and cooperation. There were no clans, or descent groups with a common name and by the third generation kinship bonds were often forgotten. Tradition rarely mentions warfare, although boundary disputes were normal and could lead to fights. Hunters, not warriors, were heroes, and they hunted for the protection of life and property, although the selection of weapons indicates they also organized for war. Missionary Nauhaus was told of a boundary dispute in November, 1893, in which six men fell on one side and only one on the other. Such friction was not called war, \\"I was told it only happens so that there would be something to talk about\\". Outside the chiefdom the world could also be dangerous. A journey of twenty-five miles could take three days because of the need to often take cover. Not only were there unfriendly villages, but also because leopards, elephants, buffalos, hippos, crocodiles, etc., were plentiful. Before the arrival of German missionaries, the Nyakyusa just 'cast their dead away' or left them at 'itago' to die. Societal life The women were dominated by the older men. They lived at their husband's residence, married ten years earlier than the men, lacked solidarity, developed little leadership, and had no kinsmen to protect their interests. Missionaries reported adultery, divorce, litigation, and marital instability to be widespread. The Nyakyusa were accused of having a 'frivolous' attitude towards marriage, for few women of thirty were still married to their first husband and were very often on their fifth or sixth. Women spent thirty hours a week fetching wood, and only when co-wives were sisters, or an aunt or niece, were they expected to work together regularly. Intense competition for the position of favorite among a man's various wives was thought by the missionaries to be at least partly responsible for the low status of women, which was still considered higher than other tribes. Age-groups dominated their whole lives. Boys guarded the fields and cattle and lived in separate camps starting at about ten years of age and lasting a lifetime. Since the women married much earlier than the men, incest was of great concern to the Nyakyusa and was resolved by putting fathers in one village and sons in another. Up to the age of ten or eleven the boys herded their father's cattle in groups, then hoed the field of their fathers and continued to eat their mother's food. They no longer slept in the houses of their fathers but joined an age-grade village of boys with a separate leader, laws, and customs and could be considered members of two villages. Men and boys were expected to eat regularly with age-mates and were encouraged to bring home two or three friends to eat; parents being proud when they did so, for if a young man often came home alone to eat, his father could beat him, or even take a spear and wound him. Isolates were not easily tolerated. The following is from M. Wilson, 'This great fool comes alone to my place, again and again, it is good to eat with friends or go around in groups of four or five.' Eating with age-mates was considered right, proper, and moral. It was considered improper, unseemly, and somewhat immoral to eat with juniors or women. Women ate alone with their young children and unmarried daughters. Sexual morality depended on the separation of the sexual activities, 'If he sleeps at home he will hear what his parents talk about at night, the night is always full of lewd talk; he may even see them undressing. He will grow up a fool.' Once again > Wilson When an oversupply of young bachelors and a shortage of unmarried girls was created, it was resolved by forming another settlement. It was only after a young man had his wife permanently with him that he was able to have his own fields and eat its produce. Cultivation of land demanded the cooperation of a man and a woman, while elaborate cooking demanded a woman. Until the man was married he still worked his father's fields and ate at his father's house. When the oldest sons of a chief reached thirty-three to thirty-five years of age the father handed over the country's government to them in the 'coming out', a ceremony of great pomp. All fires were now extinguished and new fires, kindled by friction, were lit. Since the sons were now new owners of a chiefdom, other princedoms were raided for cattle and food; they also raided their own father's land for milk, cattle, and bananas. =\\"Swagger\\"= Swaggering parades provided feasts, dances, the exhibition of beautiful bodies, and the physical strength of both men and women. Parading ornaments, fine clothes, or splendid cattle were all part of it. A father would say 'swagger first', if a son wished to marry young. Since a bachelor was thought to be a fiercer warrior than a married man, marriages were often delayed, for while urbanity and good temper were praised, readiness to fight was a valuable quality useful in war. 'We did not drive away violent men in the old days; they will fight with us in the future.' Swagger display was felt to be appropriate, particularly in bachelors, but married men also fought with skill, and none developed a military kingdom. They just raided for their neighbor's cattle, leaving the missionaries confused. Subsistence The Nyakyusa were primarily herders and banana cultivators, with cattle and milk being most important. Small cattle, being their greatest pride, were tied up at night and milked only by the men. Women were not allowed to have anything to do with cattle, and played no part in public life. They were expect to show obedience, respect, and use 'yes, my lord' when addressed, and were reported to be totally dominated by the men, but were still thought, by the missionaries, to have a position higher and better than that of other tribes. Cattle for bridewealth, however, were considered vital and gave men even more control, even though the missionaries assumed the position of women was not bad. While the Nyakyusa were expert mat makers, they produced no pots, cloth, iron, or salt, and trade remained very small. The only trade was with the Kinga when the Nyakyusa exchanged their surplus food for weapons and agricultural implements of considerable artistic merit. While the trade in weapons and tools with the Kinga was important, marriage partners with Kinga women was not, for Kinga women were considered too dirty to marry. The outbreak of rinderpest may not have devastated their herds until 1892–1896. The protection of cattle from raiders by day and witches by night, long remained the traditional community activity. People continued to use bark, home-woven cloth, or animal skins, at least until German calico came in. The chief's power depended upon his right to demand food, high bride price for his daughters, and the anticipation of entertainment. It was the Nyakyusa's practice to work together in community groups, each family doing so two or three times each year. From the missionaries' point of view, while tending to be unreliable, lying, and stealing, they found 'fireside company' very important and stressed the obligation of eating and drinking together with urban manners and friendliness. They found merry conversation to be a discussion between equals, finding it to be an outstanding example of the sustainable comfort obtainable in African life within a simple Iron Age culture. Cultivation carried prestige and provided for the hospitality on which the Nyakyusa community rested and depended. Great stress was placed on geniality and praise was placed on man for being a good mixer. Considerable pressure compelled both men and women to cultivate diligently, but not too conspicuously for each must keep in step with his neighbors. Pressure helped keep laggards up to the mark and kept the energetic from getting too far ahead. There was some small trade between the various small Nyakyusa princedoms. However, economic links between princes was flimsy at best and exchanges were most commonly within a chiefdom. There was actually very little trade between the various chiefdoms, for a state of war always existed among the Nyakyusa, whether actual or potential. The weakness of any central authority was indicated by the recurrent civil wars before the Ngoni invasion. Belief system The Nyakyusa stood naked before evil. Notions of reward and punishment in an after-life were lacking. Religion was this-worldly and concerned with fertility and prosperity. They feared punishment on this earth; and according to Monica Wilson 'a woman's barrenness was the result of her failings and she would be oppressed with guilt'. Only the coming of Christianity did the fear of burning in hell appear with rewards and punishments reserved for an after-life. =Medicines= Medicines were important in winning success, cultivation, herding, hunting, love, war, treatment of the sick, protection and retaliation, or even directly harming an enemy and defending against witches. It could be used against a thief or adulterer or put on houses or fields to bring ills quite legally. Medicine could be good or evil, legal or illegal, and able help or to harm. =Spiritual Beliefs= Belief in existence of witches was pertinent in the world view of the Nyakyusa. It was believed that certain people flew on pythons, harming people and cattle at night. These witches inherited their power and pythons from a parent, and greed was the typical motive for harming men and cattle. Pythons lusted for the meat and milk available at the funeral of those killed. Sexual dreams were not thought to come from witchcraft, even though the witches always went naked, flew through the air riding their pythons, while 'throttling' is a polite word for sexual intercourse. Some people in a village had the power to see and fight witches in their dreams and were called 'defenders', the most important being the village headmen. The visions and power of the defenders came from the same source as the witches and pythons. The defenders worked within the law and morality, while the witches acted selfishly against the law and morality. Defenders worked through dreams at night. They were powerful, using their power to punish wrongdoers and acted particularly to protect cattle, for all lived on bananas, beans, and the milk of cattle, and even though witches could avoid defenders they were considered pillars of society. They could see and drive away witches and cause them or their children to fall ill, all through the 'Power of the Python', the 'Breath of Man', the 'curse', or general public opinion. No-one admitted to having python power: it would have been boastful, proud, and ill-mannered. It was not just the lack of hospitality that shocked people and could bring on the 'Breath of Man'. Bad behavior towards parents or in-laws, swearing at or hitting a husband, having children after a daughter-in law has reached puberty, and indications of pride, could all bring on lingering illness. Still, in general the Konde were thought of as brave and intelligent. Witches are usually described as isolated and unpopular, proud men who treated neighbors with disdain and were silent in public, and women who were glum and failed to greet other women and inquire after their children. Witches seldom acted without reason: they act from greed or hatred, and against those with whom they have a grudge. Beginning with childhood, most Nyakyusa have a lively fear of witchcraft, lasting a lifetime. When a man was convicted of witchcraft he could be forced to move from a village and sometimes from the chiefdom. A woman was generally divorced, but soon remarried. Rarely was a supposed witch killed, for a witch was too useful in war to be lost to the chiefdom. If there were doubts regarding accusations of witchcraft, 'Umwafi' was resorted to. If, in drinking Umwafi, a person did not vomit, he or she was thought to be guilty. Doubters claimed that each family chose members who vomited easily. At times entire groups of people were tested with the 'Umwafi Ordeal' in order to see where the trouble was coming from. According to Monica Wilson the last case seems to have been in 1932.

Because the glaze subsequently covers it, such decoration is completely durable, and it also allows the production of pottery with a surface that has a uniform sheen. Underglaze decoration uses pigments derived from oxides which fuse with the glaze when the piece is fired in a kiln. It is also a cheaper method, as only a single firing is needed, whereas overglaze decoration requires a second firing at a lower temperature.Savage, 26-28 Many historical styles, for example Persian mina'i ware, Japanese Imari ware, Chinese doucai and wucai, combine the two types of decoration. In such cases the first firing for the body, underglaze decoration and glaze is followed by the second firing after the overglaze enamels have been applied. However, because the main or glost firing is at a higher temperature than used in overglaze decoration, the range of colours available in underglaze is more limited, and was especially so for porcelain in historical times, as the firing temperature required for the porcelain body is especially high. Early porcelain was largely restricted to underglaze blue, and a range of browns and reds. Other colours turned black in a high- temperature firing.Savage, 26-28 Examples of oxides that do not lose their colour during a glost firing are the cobalt blue made famous by Chinese Ming dynasty blue and white porcelain and the cobalt and turquoise blues, pale purple, sage green, and bole red characteristic of İznik pottery - only some European centres knew how to achieve a good red.Savage, 27 The painting styles used are covered at (among other articles): china painting, blue and white pottery, tin-glazed pottery, maiolica, Egyptian faience, Delftware. In modern times a wider range of underglaze colours are available. An archaeological excavation at the Tongguan kiln Site proved that the technology of underglaze colour arose in the Tang and Five Dynasties periods and originated from Tonguan, Changsha. However cobalt blue was first used in Persian pottery.Savage, 26 The technique has been very widely used for earthenware and porcelain, but much less often on stoneware.Savage, 29  History  Ptolemaic Faience = Ancient Egyptian faience production in the New Kingdom period employed the use of underglaze in works producing green and blue pieces that are distinct from other eras of production. This was achieved by the use of an underglaze that contrasts with the overglaze. This produces the effect of highlighting and lending spectral variance to relief patterns that are embossed into pieces such as tableware such as bowls or jars. Desired blue and green finishes were achieved with the use of copper oxide on their glazing process. Ptolemaic faience has a self-glazing process. In addition to not using successive layers of glaze after the underglaze, Ptolemaic faience also applied a lower kiln temperature. At the firing stage a bake between 900 °C and 1000 °C is applied to achieve a spectrum between turquoise blue and green. Underglaze in Ptolemaic faience was widely used for Ushabti dolls en masse for grave goods in the late Kingdom period. = Chinese Porcelain = Chinese porcelain dish with the typical Ming underglaze blue on white porcelain, Xuande Reign 1426–1435, Ming Through the Yuan and Ming dynasty, Imperial porcelain was produced with red oxide under glazes and more popular cobalt blue. Cobalt blue underglaze porcelain was adopted into the imperial style for both domestic production and Chinese export porcelain under the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties. Until late in the Xuande period the cobalt was imported from Persia; it has specks with high iron and low manganese content. This cobalt had a tendency to run when used in a tin glaze, and Persian artisans relied on the experimentation of the Chinese in Jingdezhen porcelain to achieve clear blue designs in their ceramics. Chinese whiteware was prized as an import to Islamic countries that would then trade cobalt for the manufacture of more Chinese porcelain. This was changed to a Chinese form of cobalt that in its ore form had a higher composition of MnFe2O4 rather than Fe3O4. Due to the Middle Eastern demand for blue and white porcelain the primary use of this underglaze technology was utilised in creating many designs with Islamic decoration. =Faience= Most styles in this group, such as Delftware, mostly used blue and white pottery decoration. =Islamic world= Classical İznik pottery from the Ottoman Empire has a stonepaste or frit body, and uses lead glazing rather than tin, and has usually been painted in polychrome.Savage, 95-97 Persian pottery, which was aware of Chinese styles throughout the period, made great use of underglaze decoration, but mostly in a single colour, often blue using the local cobalt, but also black.Savage, 91-93 = English Transfer Printed Earthenware = Transfer printed plate using two transfers, puce and green, c. 1830, Staffordshire pottery, Enoch Wood & Co. Underglaze normally uses a transparent glaze, and therefore reveals the undecorated parts of the fired body. In porcelain these are white, but many of the imitative types, such as Delftware, have brownish earthenware bodies, which are given a white tin-glaze and either inglaze or overglaze decoration. With the English invention of creamware and other white-bodied earthenwares in the 18th century, underglaze decoration became widely used on earthenware as well as porcelain. Transfer printing of underglaze was developed in England in Staffordshire pottery from the 1760s. The patterns were produced in the same way as printed engravings, a very well-understood technique. A copper printing plate engraved with the design would transfer underglaze pigment to a piece of dampened tissue paper through a rolled press which could then be adhered to earthenware. The colourants were the usual metallic pigments, such as cobalt blue but also include the use of chromium to create greens and browns[8]. In the English techniques, a quick firing at a low temperature might be given to fix the colours, known as \\"hardening on\\".Hughes, 136 Initially most production just included one colour, but later techniques were developed for printing in several colours.Hughes, 136 One type of English creamware using blue, green, orange and yellow colours is known as “Prattware”, after the leading manufacturer.[9] This technique was also used in Europe and America in the 19th century. = Current use = Underglaze is available in a variety of colours from commercial retailers and is used in industrial production of pottery. Low firing temperature underglazes have been formulated as well as application options such as in the form of liquid pens of glaze or solid chalk blocks. The application of underglaze techniques such as stained slips have diversified and a variety of artists have created independent chemical processes of their own to achieve desired effects. Within commercial production there is a decline in underglaze use in comparison to 18th century use due to the creation and improvement of other glazing techniques that do not require such a high heat point. The vibrancy that only underglaze was able to supply is now achievable with a variety of over-glazes therefore discounting the advantage that underglaze commercial production had. = Underglaze Transfers = Underglaze transfers are a technique that involves screenprinting a pattern onto a transfer paper (often rice paper or newspaper) which is then placed, dampened, and burnished onto the surface of a leather- hard piece of clay (similar to how a lick-and-stick tattoo might be applied). Artists can acquire rice paper to make their own custom designs, and also purchase pre-printed designs online. Unlike overglaze decals, underglaze decals are often applied to greenware and bisque and fired at higher temperatures compared to their overglaze counterparts.  Forgeries  The desirability of specific periods of white and blue underglazed Chinese porcelain has led to wide and sophisticated forgery operations. The collector market of blue and white underglaze porcelain is notable due to orientalism’s popularity in Europe. Counterfeiting operations have developed both in foreign areas and within China to profit from the collectability of Ming and Qing dynasty blue and white porcelain. From the baroque period onward, there was a slight decline in the profitability of forging Chinese porcelain as European hard paste techniques were developed but kept as industry secrets in countries such as Germany and France. Despite this there still was and continues to be a high European demand for Chinese blue and White porcelain. In the last three decades there has been a considerable increase in demand for antiques of Ming and Qing porcelain amongst China’s rising middle class, which has led to another growth in counterfeiting efforts to supply the large amount of new collectors. This counterfeiting is performed within China and sold to its own population unlike previous rushes in Europe.  Analysis of Composition  Due to the extensive efforts to counterfeit Chinese blue and white porcelain, there has been a promotion of detailed scientific analysis of the composition of cobalt used in the underglazes through Xeroradiography which has provided insight to the chemical make up of original underglaze recipes on a chemical scale. This in turn reveals historical data about the supply and manufacture industry within China at the time of production of each piece. = Identification of Pigment in Scientific Research = Multiple enquires are being made in an academic and scientific context as to quantifying the physical and chemical composition of multiple types of underglaze. X-ray fluorescence is a primary building block if this but is not acceptable for full understanding. The more prevalent techniques include the use of synchrotron radiation-based techniques. This is to achieve an analysis of the microstructure of underglazes and attempt in verifying and dating historical porcelains such as those of the Ming dynasty. This functions as a method to identify pigments and their origin. Such information is conducive to understanding the trade relations of nations at given times as pigments are sourced internationally and speak to the relationships between nations or empires. Differing cobalt’s used to colour underglazes in the Middle East and Asia regions were traded and that evidence can be found by inspecting the microstructures of historic samples of pottery using these underglazes therefore supporting other archaeological data on the interactions of these cultures.

Cannell Productions in association with Walt Disney Television. The show originated as a television movie. The program originally aired from March 31 to May 26, 1991, and lasted less than one season. Plot The series followed the story of Black Jack Savage (Steven Williams), the ghost of a legendary 17th-century Caribbean pirate who teams up with Barry Tarberry (Daniel Hugh Kelly), a crooked Wall Street con artist who has escaped trial by coming to the Caribbean. Facing eternal damnation, both of them discover that they need to save 100 lives to compensate for the damage done by their sinful lives, and thus save their own souls. Any time Black Jack tries to leave the safety of his castle haunt on San Pietro Island, he is fair game for the \\"snarks\\". They are entities that can transport Jack to Hell through an entrance at the base of the tree where he was originally hanged. Tarberry has his own difficulties dodging the government agents sent to extradite him back to the United States to stand trial for his crimes. Other characters on San Pietro include the corrupt governor-general, Abel Vasquez (Bert Rosario), with whom Tarberry is able to make another deal, and island activist Danielle (Roma Downey), who is constantly trying to help protect the locals from the effects of Vasquez's corruption and is not above enlisting Tarberry's help in doing so. The show follows the misadventures of both Black Jack and his human counterpart as they team up to dodge the law, both supernatural and secular, to make their 100 soul quota and thus win their way to salvation. Each episode ended with a graphic telling the viewers \\"??? Lives To Go...\\" = Blackbird powerboat = A regular part of every episode was an appearance of the high tech powerboat. Built by scientist/inventor Logan \\"FX\\" Murphy (played by Steve Hytner), the Blackbird was a black trimaran speedboat that resembled a SR-71 reconnaissance plane. It was originally commissioned by the previous owner of Blackbird Castle, a drug runner. After his arrest, Tarberry took possession of the Blackbird from Murphy. When not in use, the Blackbird was moored at a secret dock at Blackbird Castle on San Pietro Island.

Its industry includes furniture production. Etymology Ocotlán means \\"near the pines\\" or \\"place of the ocote (pines)\\". Ocote is from Nahuatl ocōtl, Pinus montezumae, a species of pine. History Ocotlán was founded in 1530. Two main cathedrals line the plaza. One is the church named La Purisima (\\"The Most Pure\\"), which is one of the oldest buildings in Jalisco. The altar is dipped in gold. The other cathedral, more recent than La Purisima, was built in the late 1800s and dedicated to Nuestro Señor de Misericordia (Our Merciful Lord), which honors a vision of Christ seen after an extremely destructive earthquake. The current municipal president is Lic. Absalón García Ochoa, from the National Action Party. Appearance of Christ On October 2, 1847 at approximately 0730, a large and powerful earthquake destroyed most of the city, including the original church. The following day, a Sunday, when the faithful were attending a Mass outside of the destroyed church, a vision of the crucifix was claimed to have been seen. It is said that they saw the vision of Christ, which is why the people of Ocotlán celebrate this day with high regards. It is a recognized event, not to be forgotten. It has become a tradition passed from generation to generation, with celebrations taking place in Ocotlán, and in different parts of the United States by those who have migrated from Ocotlán. Geography Ocotlán borders Poncitlán and Tototlán and is only 50 minutes drive east-southeast from the city of Guadalajara. It is on the northeast end of Lake Chapala, Mexico's largest lake. As of 2010, the city had a population of 92,967. The municipality of Ocotlán, which has an area of 247.7 km² (95.64 sq mi), had a population of 89,340. The proper gentilic for the inhabitants is Ocotlense. The altitude of the city is 5020 ft, and the time zone is UTC-6. Businesses Some of the businesses in Ocotlán are Nestlé, Celanese, Forrajes El Nogal, Maderas primas de occidente, Triplay y Aglomerados, Fábrica de Muebles La Cibeles and many other furniture factories, like EMMAN, an MDF manufacturer. Celanese closed its acetate flake plant, built in 1947, on 31 October 2019, eliminating 200 jobs. Architecture One of the most important buildings is the new library and media center, recently opened to the public in 2000, and operated by the University of Guadalajara. The modern building is inspired by the lineal constructions of the university center. It features an impressive lobby of multiple heights in which the main elements of the visual composition of the space are the books themselves. The building was designed by the young architecture firm LeAP, based in Guadalajara. It has been published and exhibited locally and internationally.

The film earned US$28,881,266 at the box office, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film starring Pauly Shore (behind Encino Man, Son in Law and A Goofy Movie). Plot The film begins as two slackers, Bones Conway (Pauly Shore) and Jack Kaufman (Andy Dick) work at \\"Crazy Boys\\" discount electronics store in Glendale, California. While they goof off on the job, both have aspirations of opening their own electronics store in the future. Both are fired though, after destroying a rack of television sets. Looking to score some quick start-up money for their store, and believing that the commitment will be minimal (they are easily lured by the recruiting slogan \\"One weekend a month, two weeks a year\\"), the two join the United States Army Reserves. Bones chooses water purification for their field since his brother was an experienced pool man and the field appeared to be devoid of combat. After surviving basic training, they attend water purification training. The two meet up with Christine Jones (Lori Petty), a female recruit longing for infantry, and Fred Ostroff (David Alan Grier), a skittish dental student. The foursome adopts the nickname of \\"waterboys\\". The group then returns to Glendale. What Bones and Jack do not realize, however, was that Libya has been planning an invasion of Chad, and they are consequently called up for service overseas. They first try to get a military discharge by pretending to be homosexuals, but they fail. Upon arriving in Chad, the four do not get along well with the full-time soldiers, particularly Special Forces Staff Sergeant Stern (Esai Morales). On a routine mission to resupply a forward base, their convoy is ambushed by a Libyan commando squad. The misfit reserves are thought to have been killed in action (KIA) and are left to fend for themselves. After a few days lost in the desert, they are captured by the Libyan forces and spend a night in a Libyan POW camp. There the reservists meet up with Staff Sergeant Stern who has been shot and captured in an ambush. He briefs them on his failed mission to rendezvous with two HALOed Fast Attack vehicles and destroy mobile Scud launchers carrying missiles armed with chemical warheads aimed at American bases in the region. During an airstrike, the four reservists and Stern escape and find the Fast Attack vehicles. They make contact with the American headquarters and are ordered to finish the Special Forces' mission. After locating the missiles, they have a difficult time holding off a battalion of Libyans while painting the missiles with a laser for an incoming airstrike. The airstrike goes off-target, forcing the reservists to destroy the missiles themselves. Bones grabs an AT4 anti-tank rocket launcher and destroys the Scud launcher base in one hit, but not before accidentally firing one rocket backwards, forcing the group to use the last rocket they have. The \\"waterboys\\" return home as heroes. At the end of the film, they open up their electronics shop next to an Army recruiting station -- where two men like themselves are looking skeptical about joining the reserves.

She was named for Midshipman Loveman Noa. At the beginning of World War II she was converted to a High-speed transport and redesignated APD-24. History Noa was built by the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia. Authorized 6 October 1917, she was laid down 18 November 1918. She was launched on 28 June 1919, sponsored by Mrs. Albert Morehead, sister of Midshipman Loveman Noa; and commissioned 15 February 1921. Following shakedown out of Virginia, Noa operated out of Charleston, South Carolina. Through May 1922, she participated in Atlantic Coast training maneuvers. In late May, she sailed for duty on the Asiatic Station, steaming via the Mediterranean and Aden and Ceylon. She reached Singapore 14 August and on 30 September, she arrived at her new home yard at Cavite, Philippine Islands. Through the summer of 1922, Noa remained active on the Asiatic station. She patrolled Chinese and Philippine waters and attempted to protect American interests during the Chinese Civil War, which was renewed in November 1922. On 27 February 1927, the Noa arrived at Nanjing, China, relieving USS Simpson as the ship stationed there \\"to protect American lives and property.\\" On 24 March 1927, with her sister ship, USS William B. Preston, and Royal Navy light cruiser HMS Emerald, she helped to rescue foreigners from Nanjing. The three ships used their main batteries to lay down a barrage of shrapnel and high explosive on Socony Hill, driving back hostile Chinese forces and also halting sniping along the Nanjing Bund and a sortie by Kuomintang gunboats. This allowed refugees to retreat down the hill to the safety of U.S. and British warships. Noa also participated in the periodic fleet exercises which were intended to keep crew and equipment at peak efficiency. Upon return to the United States on 14 August 1929, Noa went into the Mare Island Navy Yard for overhaul before assignment to West Coast operations. Through the next five years, she operated out of San Diego as a unit of the Battle Fleet. During the fall and winter of 1929, Noa was called upon to assist in plane guard duties with carriers and , off the California coast. She thus participated in the early development of U.S. carrier-group tactics. She also took part in the fleet exercises from 1930 to 1934. Noa served as cruise ship for Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps students from the University of California, Berkeley from 17 June to 8 July 1934. She then steamed for Philadelphia on 14 August 1934, decommissioned there on 11 November 1934, and was placed in reserve. World War II Noa recommissioned at Philadelphia on 1 April 1940 and was fitted with a seaplane which nested just forward of the after deckhouse, replacing the after torpedo tubes. At the same time, a boom for lifting the aircraft was stepped in place of the mainmast. She steamed for the Delaware Capes in May and conducted tests with an XSOC-1 seaplane piloted by Lt. G. L. Heap. The plane was hoisted onto the ocean for takeoff and then recovered by Noa while the ship was underway. Lt. Heap also made an emergency flight 15 May to transfer a sick man to the Naval Hospital at Philadelphia. Such dramatic demonstrations convinced the Secretary of the Navy that destroyer-based scout planes had value, and on 27 May, he directed that six new destroyers of the soon-to-be-constructed Fletcher-class (DD 476–481) be fitted with catapults and handling equipment. Because of mechanical deficiencies in the hoisting gear, the program was cancelled early in 1943. The concept thus failed to mature as a combat technique, but the destroyer-observation seaplane team was to be revived under somewhat modified conditions during later amphibious operations. Noa spent much of the next two years on experimental assignments and on midshipman training operations out of Annapolis, Maryland. She underwent availability at Boston Navy Yard the first week of December 1941 and then participated in Chesapeake Bay exercises through 27 December. Next, she steamed for Key West, Florida and participated in the shakedown of major fleet units in the Gulf of Mexico. After acting as a plane and screen guard for the carrier , she steamed for Hampton Roads. En route, a large wave carried away part of her bridge and she put in at Charleston, S.C. for emergency repairs. She then steamed for Boston via Bermuda. Upon completion of repairs at Boston Navy Yard, she was directed to conduct Atlantic coast antisubmarine warfare (ASW) patrols, commencing 25 March 1943. At 09.03 hours on 3 April 1943, the unescorted Gulfstate (Master James Frank Harrell, lost) was hit by two torpedoes from U-155 about 50 miles southeast of Marathon Key, Florida, while steaming a nonevasive course at 10.5 knots. Eight officers, 26 crewmen and nine armed guards were lost. Three of the wounded were later transferred to Noa for medical treatment. She also participated in the training program for the Navy's Sound School at Key West. Until 28 July, she operated out of Key West, assigned training, patrol, rescue, and convoy escort duties. Noa reported to the Sixth Amphibious Forces 31 July. During August and September, she was converted, at Norfolk Navy Yard, to a high speed transport and was reclassified APD-24 on 10 August 1943. Work was completed 17 September and after shakedown in the Chesapeake river, she departed Norfolk 18 October and escorted to San Diego via the Panama Canal, arriving 2 November. Noa steamed for Pearl Harbor 4 November, arriving 10 November for a week of yard availability. Underway 19 November, she escorted SS J. H. Kincaid to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, via Samoa, arriving 4 December. She departed 5 December and steamed to Buna, New Guinea, where she assumed duty as landing craft control ship 11 December. In this capacity, she steamed between Buna, and Cape Cretin, New Guinea. She was detached from this duty and anchored off Cape Sudest 21 December. She steamed for Cape Gloucester, New Britain, 25 December and arrived just before dawn the next day. After a preliminary bombardment by naval and army air units, Noa landed 144 officers and men of the First Marine Division. She returned to Cape Sudest via Buna 27 December to take on 203 more First Division Marines, who reinforced the forces at Cape Gloucester 29 December. Her operations in the Cape Gloucester landings extended through 1 March 1944. Noa's participation in the Bismarck Archipelago operation also took her through the Green Island landings (15–19 February). In the Purvis Bay area of the Solomon Islands, she performed patrol and escort operations 21 February – 7 March. She next steamed to Tassafaronga Point, Guadalcanal, and took on Fourth Marine Division troops for the Emirau Island assault of 23 March. By 8 April, she was back at Cape Cretin, New Guinea, where she took on troops for the Hollandia amphibious operations that extended from late April through 1 May. Noa steamed for Pearl Harbor 11 May, arrived 23 May, and embarked units of the Second Marine Division for transport to Saipan. She patrolled assigned areas off Saipan 15 June and that day shot down a raiding aircraft. The next day, she landed her troops and continued patrol operations until 24 June, when she steamed to Eniwetok Atoll. Noa departed Eniwetok 30 June and escorted to Saipan, arriving 4 July. She conducted patrol and screening operations off Tinian and Saipan through the next week. During the Guam operations of 12 July – 15 August, Noa served as a screening ship. By 16 August, she had returned to Guadalcanal and the next day, she commenced patrol operations out of Purvis Bay. Departing Purvis Bay 6 September, she steamed for the Palau Islands to conduct underwater demolition activities. While en route, she was rammed by at 0350, 12 September 1944. She immediately began to settle. Rescue efforts were performed by the crew of Fullam in an attempt to save the sinking Noa; numerous members of the team received battlefield commissions, including Seaman Joseph DeSisto. The order to abandon ship was given at 0501, but by 0700, Noas commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander H. Wallace Boud, USNR had returned to her with a salvage party, including Lt. George A. Williams, Engineering Officer of the Noa who also testified at the court martial of the Fullams commander. Salvage efforts failed, however, and the second order to abandon ship was given at 1030; the old ship sank by the stern at 1034 with no loss of life. The commanding officer of Fullam was court-martialed in November 1944 in San Francisco, California.

The term encompasses people of all ethnic backgrounds with ancestry in present-day Myanmar (or Burma), regardless of specific ethnicity. They are a subgroup of Asian Americans. The majority of Burmese Americans are of Burmese Chinese descent, particularly Teochew, Hokkien, and Yunnanese, rather than Bamar, the dominant ethnic group in Myanmar; they may alternatively identify as simply Chinese Americans. However, other types of Burmese ethnic groups immigrating to the U.S. have been on the rise in recent years. As a small group, Burmese Americans have largely integrated into the larger Southeast Asian and South Asian American communities. History in the United States The first Burmese to study in the United States was Maung Shaw Loo, an ethnic Mon, who came in 1858 to study at the University at Lewisburg (now Bucknell University) in Pennsylvania. He graduated with a medical degree in 1867 and returned the following year. The first major wave of immigration from Myanmar occurred in the 1960s, after Ne Win established military rule in 1962, to the late 1970s. Most who immigrated were primarily those with Chinese origins, who arrived in increasing numbers following the 1967 anti-Chinese riots.Cheah 201. The Burmese Chinese were the first major group of Theravada Buddhists to immigrate to the United States and were largely educated professionals, business entrepreneurs and technically skilled workers. A minority were of Anglo- Burmese and Indian descent. Some of the Burmese immigrated to the United States after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 abolished the previously existing quota on Asian immigrants. A second wave occurred during the 1980s to the early 1990s after the national uprising in 1988. This wave consisted of many different ethnic groups, including Bamars, Karens, and those from other ethnic minorities, particularly in search of better opportunities. Among this wave are political refugees numbering a few thousand, who were involved in the 8888 Uprising and are concentrated in Fort Wayne, Indiana.Cheah 202. From 1977 to 2000, 25,229 Burmese immigrated to the United States, although the figure is inaccurate because it does not include Burmese who immigrated via other channels or through other third countries. A third wave of immigration, from 2006 to date, has been primarily of ethnic minorities in Myanmar, in particular Karen refugees from the Thai-Burmese border. From October 2006 to August 2007, 12,800 Karen refugees resettled in the United States. Burmese in far smaller numbers continue to immigrate to the United States today mainly through family sponsorships and the \\"green card lottery\\". Thousands of Burmese each year apply to a Diversity Visa Program (previously known as \\"OP\\" and now called \\"DV\\"), a lottery-based program that grants visas to those who wish to reside in the United States. According to the 2010 United States Census, 100,200 persons of Burmese descent resided in the United States, an increase of 499% over the previous census, which recorded 16,720 individuals of Burmese descent. Leading up to the census, an awareness campaign was conducted by the Burmese Complete Count Committee, which consisted of Burmese American organizations, to convince Burmese Americans to self-identify as \\"Burmese\\" on their census forms. Following the 2010 census, Burmese-Americans are no longer ambiguously categorized as \\"Other Asian,\\" but in a separate category. Communities Rakhine minority performing on the Burmese New Year, Thingyan, in New York City Most Burmese Americans live in metropolitan areas with large immigrant populations. As of 2015, the metropolitan areas with the largest Burmese populations are Minneapolis-Saint Paul (with 10,000), Dallas-Fort Worth (with 7,000), Greater New York (with 7,000), the Bay Area (with 6,000), Atlanta (with 6,000), Los Angeles (with 5,000), Indianapolis (with 4,000), Buffalo (with 4,000), Washington (with 4,000), and Des Moines (with 3,000). Other areas of significance include Tulsa, Oklahoma; Fort Wayne, Indiana, the residence of many Burmese refugees; Chicago; San Diego; and Florida. * Minneapolis, Minnesota — Most of Minnesota's 2,500+ Karen live in the Twin Cities. * Fort Wayne, IndianaBoen, Jennifer L., (2009-01-30).

A few ethnic Mon and Rakhine monasteries serve their respective ethnic populations. Burmese Christian churches consisting mainly of ethnic Karen, Chin, Kachin, and Anglo-Burmese congregations can also be found in large metropolitan areas. Many Christian Burmese found asylum in the U.S. as refugees. English is the primary language for most Burmese Americans, albeit with varying levels of fluency depending on the level of education and the years lived in the country. Burmese is still widely spoken or understood as most Burmese Americans are recent immigrants or first generation children of those immigrants. Still, the command of spoken Burmese among the American-born Burmese is basic to poor, and that of written Burmese is close to none. Some older Burmese of Chinese origin speak some Chinese (typically, Mandarin, Minnan, or Cantonese); likewise some of Indian-origin speak some Indic language (usually Tamil and Hindi/Urdu). Notable people This is a list of notable Burmese Americans including both original immigrants who obtained American citizenship and their American descendants.

It was established by Alexander Tilloch in 1798;John Burnett, \\"Tilloch, Alexander (1759–1825)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, May 2006, accessed 17 Feb 2010 in 1822 Richard Taylor became joint editor and it has been published continuously by Taylor & Francis ever since. Early history The name of the journal dates from a period when \\"natural philosophy\\" embraced all aspects of science. The very first paper published in the journal carried the title \\"Account of Mr Cartwright's Patent Steam Engine\\". Other articles in the first volume include \\"Methods of discovering whether Wine has been adulterated with any Metals prejudicial to Health\\" and \\"Description of the Apparatus used by Lavoisier to produce Water from its component Parts, Oxygen and Hydrogen\\". 19th century Early in the nineteenth century, classic papers by Humphry Davy, Michael Faraday and James Prescott Joule appeared in the journal and in the 1860s James Clerk Maxwell contributed several long articles, culminating in a paper containing the deduction that light is an electromagnetic wave or, as he put it himself, \\"We can scarcely avoid the inference that light consists in transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena\\". The famous experimental paper of Albert A. Michelson and Edward Morley was published in 1887 and this was followed ten years later by J. J. Thomson with article \\"Cathode Rays\\" – essentially the discovery of the electron. In 1814, the Philosophical Magazine merged with the Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts, otherwise known as Nicholson's Journal (published by William Nicholson), to form The Philosophical Magazine and Journal.see the \\"Advertisement\\" at the start of Volume 42 of The Philosophical Magazine 31 December 1813 https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/53080#page/20/mode/1up announcing the merger. Further mergers in 1827 with the Annals of Philosophy, and in 1840 with The London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science (named the Edinburgh Journal of Science until 1832) led to the retitling of the journal as The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science. In 1949, the title reverted to The Philosophical Magazine. 20th century In the early part of the 20th century, Ernest Rutherford was a frequent contributor. He once told a friend to \\"watch out for the next issue of Philosophical Magazine; it is highly radioactive!\\" Aside from his work on understanding radioactivity, Rutherford proposed the experiments of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden that verified his nuclear model of the atom and led to Niels Bohr's famous paper on planetary electrons, which was published in the journal in 1913. Another classic contribution from Rutherford was entitled \\"Collision of α Particles with Light Atoms. IV. An Anomalous Effect in Nitrogen\\" – an article describing no less than the discovery of the proton, which he named a year later. In 1978 the journal was divided into two independent parts, Philosophical Magazine A and Philosophical Magazine B. Part A published papers on structure, defects and mechanical properties while Part B focussed on statistical mechanics, electronic, optical and magnetic properties. Recent developments Since the middle of the 20th century, the journal has focused on condensed matter physics and published significant papers on dislocations, mechanical properties of solids, amorphous semiconductors and glasses. As subject area evolved and it became more difficult to classify research into distinct areas, it was no longer considered necessary to publish the journal in two parts, so in 2003 parts A and B were re-merged. In its current form, 36 issues of the Philosophical Magazine are published each year, supplemented by 12 issues of Philosophical Magazine Letters. Editors Previous editors of the Philosophical Magazine have been John Tyndall, J.J. Thomson, Sir Nevill Mott, and William Lawrence Bragg. The journal is currently edited by Edward A. Davis.  Philosophical Magazine Letters  In 1987, the sister journal Philosophical Magazine Letters was established with the aim of rapidly publishing short communications on all aspects of condensed matter physics. It is edited by Edward A. Davis and Peter Riseborough. This monthly journal had a 2014 impact factor of 1.087. Series Over its 200-year history, Philosophical Magazine has occasionally restarted its volume numbers at 1, designating a new \\"series\\" each time. The journal's series are as follows: * Philosophical Magazine, Series 1 (1798–1826), volumes 1 through 68 * Philosophical Magazine, Series 2 (1827–1832), volumes 1 through 11 * Philosophical Magazine, Series 3 (1832–1850), volumes 1 through 37 * Philosophical Magazine, Series 4 (1851–1875), volumes 1 through 50 * Philosophical Magazine, Series 5 (1876–1900), volumes 1 through 50 * Philosophical Magazine, Series 6 (1901–1925), volumes 1 through 50 * Philosophical Magazine, Series 7 (1926–1955), volumes 1 through 46 * Philosophical Magazine, Series 8 (1955–present), volumes 1 through 95 (through December 2015) If the renumbering had not occurred, the 2015 volume (series 8, volume 95) would have been volume 407.

The islands lie off the western coast of Africa. Geography The ecoregion covers an area of 3,645 km². The archipelago is volcanic in origin. The archipelago consists of ten islands and five islets, divided into the windward (Barlavento) and leeward (Sotavento) groups. The six islands in the Barlavento group are Santo Antão (779 km²), São Vicente (227 km²), Santa Luzia (34 km²), São Nicolau (379 km²), Sal (216 km²), and Boa Vista (620 km²). The four islands in the Sotavento group are Maio (269 km²), Santiago (991 km²), Fogo (476 km²), and Brava (66 km²). All but Santa Luzia are inhabited. Santiago is the largest island, and is home to half the country's population and its capital, Praia. Several of the islands are mountainous, and summits over are 1000 meters are found on Fogo (Pico do Fogo, 2,829 m), Santo Antão (Tope de Coroa, 1,979 m), Santiago (Pico de Antónia, 1,392 m), and São Nicolau (Monte Gordo, 1,312 m). Three islands – Sal, Boa Vista, and Maio – are generally low and dry, and lack reliable water supplies. The Cape Verde islands are part of Macaronesia, a group of archipelagoes in the Atlantic Ocean which share similarities in climate and ecology. Climate The Cape Verde Islands have a tropical climate. Most rainfall is during the warm August and November wet season. The dry season extends from December to July. Higher islands create orographic precipitation and receive higher rainfall. Flora The islands' original flora is not well understood, but likely included savanna or steppe at lower elevations, with semi-desert plants on the lower and drier portions of the archipelago. The higher islands with more precipitation may have supported dry monsoon woodlands or forests. The more humid areas of the islands have been converted to agriculture, and native woodland vegetation persists in isolated enclaves on steep slopes. There are 750 species of vascular plants on the islands. The majority have been introduced since the islands were settled. 33 pteridophyte species and 240 flowering plants are thought to be native. There are many endemic species among the natives, including the fern Dryopteris gorgonea and 85 flowering plant species from 42 genera, including the endemic genus Tornabenea. Native tree species include the dragon’s blood tree (Dracaena draco), the fig trees Ficus sycomorus ssp. gnaphalocarpa and Ficus sur, the tamarisk Tamarix senegalensis, and the endemic trees marmulan (Sideroxylon marginatum) and Cape Verde Island date palm or tamareira (Phoenix atlantica). Most of the native trees are threatened by destruction of their habitat.Duarte, Maria & Romeiras, Maria. (2009). \\"Cape Verde Islands\\". in Encyclopedia of Islands University of California Press, USA, 2009. pp.501-512. After Portuguese colonization in the 15th century, the clearing of land for agriculture and grazing by goats reduced and degraded the native vegetation and tree cover, which caused extensive soil erosion. Portuguese colonial authorities began to establish forest plantations in the early 20th century to reduce soil erosion and restore watersheds. Between 1928 to 1975, 30 km² were afforested with non- native pines, cypresses, and eucalyptus, mostly on Santo Antão, Fogo, and São Nicolau. The oldest plantations in the highlands of Santo Antão and São Vicente have now grown into dense forests. Tree planting continued after independence in 1975, and recent afforestation projects have focused on the drier areas of Santiago, Maio, and Brava islands. The species used in these areas include Prosopis juliflora, Acacia spp., and Ziziphus mauritiana, which are adapted to the drier conditions.\\"Land Use, Land Cover, and Trends in Cabo Verde\\". West Africa: Land Use and Land Cover Dynamics. U.S. Aid and USGS. Accessed 7 May 2020. In 2013, it was estimated that 97 km² of the islands were covered in forest, 22 km² in woodland, and 225 km² in tree plantations.Tappan, G. G., Cushing, W.M., Cotillon, S.E., Mathis, M.L., Hutchinson, J.A., Herrmann, S.M., and Dalsted, K.J., 2016, West Africa Land Use Land Cover Time Series: U.S. Geological Survey data release, http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F73N21JF Fauna The Cape Verde Islands are home to five endemic bird species. The Iago sparrow (Passer iagoensis) and Cape Verde swift (Apus alexandri) are found on most of the islands. The endangered Raso lark (Alauda razae) is limited to uninhabited Raso Island, and the Cape Verde warbler (Acrocephalus brevipennis) is found only on Santiago Island. The Cape Verde buzzard (Buteo bannermanni) is also endemic to the islands. Bourne's heron or Cape Verde heron (Ardea purpurea bournei) is a endangered subspecies of heron endemic to the islands, with 40 birds living on Santiago Island. The islands are an important nesting area for seabirds. Two species breed only in the Cape Verde Islands. The Cape Verde shearwater (Calonectris edwardsii) breeds in February and March, principally on the islands of Brava, Branco and Raso in February and March Fea's petrel (Pterodroma feae) breeds on Fogo, Santo Antão, São Nicolau and Santiago in the spring and autumn. The islands are also important breeding areas for the magnificent frigatebird (Fregata magnificens), and for a subspecies of red-billed tropicbird (Phaethon aethereus mesonauta ). Prior to colonization, the only mammals on the islands were bats. Several species have since been introduced to the islands, including sheep, goats, and cattle, green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus), slender mongoose (Galerella sanguinea), European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), black rat (Rattus rattus) and brown rat (Rattus norvegicus).Duarte, Maria & Romeiras, Maria. (2009). \\"Cape Verde Islands\\". in Encyclopedia of Islands University of California Press, USA, 2009. pp.501-512. There are 22 native species of lizards on the Cape Verde Islands, all of which are endemic – three geckos in genus Hemidactylus, 12 wall geckos of genus Tarentola, and seven skinks in genus Chioninia. There are three non-native reptiles living on the island.Vasconcelos, R., Brito, J., Carranza, S., & Harris, D. (2013).

In his earlier political career he was tribune of the plebs in 141 BC and praetor in 136 BC. He also held the position of Pontifex Maximus for sixteen years after his consulship and died around 115 BC. Scaevola was consul at the time of Tiberius Gracchus' tribuneship and murder, and was heavily involved in reconciling the senate following Gracchus' death. According to Cicero, Scaevola supported Gracchus' land reforms (Lex Sempronia Agraria), but the extent of his involvement has been debated by some historians.  Family  Publius belonged to the gens Mucia, a noble Plebeian family of Rome, of which the Scaevolae were the main branch. Several Scaevolae appear in Roman magistracies before the appearance of Publius Mucius, including a certain Publius Mucius Scaevola who served as a tribune of the plebs in 486 BC and a Publius Mutius Scaevola—who, while not of the same branch, clearly belongs to the Scaevola clan—who held the Tribunate of the Soldiers in the same year, suggesting the Scaevola family was an entrenched Republican family of senatorial class from at least 486 BC. In legend the Scaevolas draw their name from a Gaius Mucius Scaevola of 508 BC who supposedly attempted to assassinate the Etruscan king of Clusium, Lars Porsena and upon killing his secretary due to a mix up in interpreting Etruscan dress, thrust his arm into a brazier and declared that 300 young men like him would come for Porsena, leading to the king's withdrawal out of fear for his personal safety. Publius Mucius Scaevola had a father of the same name, who was consul in 175 BC with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Scaevola served as Pontifex Maximus following his younger brother Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus’s death. Mucianus was elected consul alongside with high priest Lucius Valerius Flaccus in the year 131 BC, after previously serving as Pontifex Maximus in 132 BC. Scaevola was also the father of Quintus Mucius Scaevola who was a consul in 95 BC. He was responsible for the Lex Licinia Mucia, which sent Italian residents of Rome falsely claiming citizenship back to their own towns.  Early political career  Tribune of the Plebs 141 BC = Publius Mucius Scaevola served as tribune of the plebs in 141 BC. The consuls of this year were Cnaeus Servilius Caepio and Quintus Pompeius. Not much is known of Scaevola’s actions during his year as tribune. Most significant in the historical record is his carrying of a plebiscite which placed Hostilius Tubulus on trial for accepting bribes during his year as praetor in 142 BC. = Praetor 136 BC = Scaevola was elected as praetor in 136 BC. Lucius Furius Philus and Sextus Atilius Serranus were consuls during this year. During his year as a praetor Scaevola argued vehemently against the citizenship rights of Mancinus, who had demonstrated cowardice the previous year during a campaign in the Numantine War and had subsequently been surrendered to the Numantines as punishment, but had been rejected.  Consulship 133 BC  Rome during Scaevola’s Consulship = thumb Publius was elected consul at a pivotal point in Roman history. The Punic Wars had ended only 13 years beforehand and Rome now controlled many new territories around the Mediterranean through military expeditions such as Scipio Aemilianus’ conquest of Numantia in modern-day Spain, as well as the annexation of Asia Minor. Upon the death of Attallus III of Pergamum in 133 BC Rome was granted the land belonging to Attallus in his will. However, an Attalid pretender called Eumenes III tried to retain the lands. In 130 BC he defeated Scaevola’s brother and then-consul Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus, killing him. Later, Scaevola’s son Quintus Mucius Scaevola engaged in more fighting in the region, though not of clear nature, receiving a proconsular command in 121 BC. The rapid expansionism throughout this period caused internal unrest that had triggered the First Servile War in Sicily two years earlier in 135 BC. Publius Mucius Scaevola’s fellow consul Lucius Calpernius Piso led armies in 133 BC against the slave revolt on the island of Sicily. This revolt was led by a man named Eunus, a semi-prophetic military leader who managed to win several small scale engagements against larger Roman forces. Piso managed to suppress this long-running revolt, though Scaevola had little involvement in this campaign and therefore shared little of the popularity and prestige it incurred. At some point during this period both Piso and Scaevola were absent from the city of Rome, meaning the Senate was presided over by the urban praetor. = Tiberius Gracchus = Lex Sempronia Agraria  Guillaume Rouille (1518?-1589) - \\"Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum\\" Before Tiberius Gracchus drew up the highly significant Lex Agraria, he consulted with the preeminent citizens of the day, including Publius Mucius Scaevola, who was consul at the time. Plutarch describes Publius Mucius as a jurist, foremost in virtue and reputation. Following his consultation with Publius Mucius, among others, Gracchus drew up a law that was more lenient towards those occupying public lands than expected.  Jury (Gracchus vs. Scipio)  When conflict between Tiberius Gracchus and his opponents came to a head, Publius Mucius Scaevola publicly refused to support Scipio Nasica’s attempt to depose Gracchus. But following Tiberius' death he tried to restore stability to the Senate, by retrospectively approving the violent events he had previously refused to support. Twentieth century historians have debated whether this about-face demonstrates a man of integrity standing above the factional squabbles in order to secure stability in precarious circumstances, or the propensity to change his factional allegiance at the drop of a hat. For example, in 1965 Erich S. Gruen depicted Publius Mucius Scaevola as a man constantly changing factional allegiance – describing him as a successful but unprincipled politician. In contrast, Wiseman, Bernstein, and Badian all argued in the early 1970s for a more favourable assessment of Scaevola as a man of independence and integrity.  Later life  Pontifex Maximus 130-115 BC = Publius Mucius Scaevola became Pontifex Maximus in 130 BC, after his brother, Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus, was killed in battle while fighting in the kingdom of Pergamum. His most notable contribution during this period was the publication of the final Annales Maximi. The Annales Maximi were annals maintained by the Pontifex Maximus, dating back to 400 BC. The Pontifex Maximus, the highest- ranking priest in the Roman Republic, was responsible for recording the names of the magistrates of each year, as well as significant events. The annals ceased being written in the 130s BC, and Publius Mucius Scaevola reportedly published the complete record in his capacity as Pontifex Maximus. = Death = According to historian David Stockton, the exact year of Publius Mucius Scaevola’s death is unknown. Later juristic writers indicate he was still alive in 121 BC, but he must have died some time before 114 BC, when a different chief pontiff presided over the first trial of the Vestal Virgins.

The top ten on the 2019-2020 list are as follows: Golf Digest, America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses, January 2019 # Pine Valley Golf Club – Pine Valley, New Jersey # Augusta National Golf Club – Augusta, Georgia # Cypress Point Club – Pebble Beach, California # Shinnecock Hills Golf Club – Southampton, New York # Oakmont Country Club – Oakmont, Pennsylvania # Merion Golf Club (East Course) – Ardmore, Pennsylvania # Pebble Beach Golf Links – Pebble Beach, California # National Golf Links of America – Southampton, New York # Sand Hills Golf Club - Mullen, Nebraska # Fishers Island Club – Fishers Island, New York The top ten on the 2009–10 list were as follows:America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses/2009-10 , Golf Digest, Accessed April 8, 2009 # Augusta National Golf Club – Augusta, Georgia # Pine Valley Golf Club – Pine Valley, New Jersey # Shinnecock Hills Golf Club – Southampton, New York # Cypress Point Club – Pebble Beach, California # Oakmont Country Club – Oakmont, Pennsylvania # Pebble Beach Golf Links – Pebble Beach, California # Merion Golf Club (East Course) – Ardmore, Pennsylvania # Winged Foot Golf Club (West Course) – Mamaroneck, New York # Fishers Island Club – Fishers Island, New York # Seminole Golf Club – Juno Beach, Florida The top ten on the 2007–08 list, published in May 2007, were as follows: #Pine Valley Golf Club – Pine Valley, New Jersey #Shinnecock Hills Golf Club – Southampton, New York #Augusta National Golf Club – Augusta, Georgia #Cypress Point Club – Pebble Beach, California #Oakmont Country Club – Oakmont, Pennsylvania #Pebble Beach Golf Links – Pebble Beach, California #Merion Golf Club (East Course) – Ardmore, Pennsylvania #Winged Foot Golf Club (West Course) – Mamaroneck, New York #Seminole Golf Club – Juno Beach, Florida #Crystal Downs Country Club – Frankfort, Michigan \\"America's Top 50 Courses for Women\\" In 2010 Golf Digest produced its inaugural ranking of \\"America's Top 50 Courses for Women\\". In creating the ranking, the magazine used nominations and evaluations by its panel of over 100 female raters as well as the woman-friendly criteria established by the editors. Those criteria included: at least one tee less than 5,300 yards; at least two sets of tees with USGA slope and course ratings for women; run-up areas to most or all greens and minimal forced carries for those playing from the forward tees. Golf Digest, America's Top 50 Courses for Women, January 5, 2010 The top ten on the 2013 list are as follows: Golf Digest, America's Top 50 Courses for Women, July 2013 # Pine Valley Golf Club – Pine Valley, New Jersey # Sea Island Golf Club – St. Simons, Georgia # The Boulders Resort and Golf Club – Carefree, Arizona # Bandon Dunes Golf Resort (Old MacDonald)– Bandon, Oregon # Running Y Ranch – Klamath Falls, Oregon # Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort (Ocean Links) - Amelia Island, Florida # LPGA International (Champions) - Daytona Beach, Florida # Rope Rider Golf Course at Suncadia Resort - Cle Elum, Washington # Keystone Resort (River) - Keystone, Colorado # Grand Cypress Golf Club (East/North) - Orlando, Florida \\"America's 100 Greatest Public Golf Courses\\" Alongside the \\"100 Greatest Courses\\" ranking, and using the same methodology, Golf Digest publishes a list of \\"America's 100 Greatest Public Golf Courses\\". In this context, \\"public\\" means a golf course that is open to play by the public, as opposed to a private club—not necessarily a course operated by a governmental entity. The top ten on the 2007–08 list, also published in May 2007, was as follows: #Pebble Beach Golf Links – Pebble Beach, California #Pacific Dunes Golf Course – Bandon, Oregon #Pinehurst No. 2 – Pinehurst, North Carolina #The Straits Course, Whistling Straits – Haven, Wisconsin #Bethpage Black Course – Farmingdale, New York #Shadow Creek Golf Course – North Las Vegas, Nevada #Bandon Dunes Golf Course – Bandon, Oregon #The Ocean Course at Kiawah Island – Kiawah Island, South Carolina #Prince Golf Course – Princeville, Hawaii #Arcadia Bluffs Golf Course – Arcadia, Michigan Of these courses, the only one that is operated by a governmental entity is Bethpage Black. In addition to its national rankings, Golf Digest also ranks courses at a state level. For example, in a 1998 survey of Connecticut Public Golf Courses, Golf Digest ranked Crestbrook Park Golf Course as one of Connecticut's top public golf courses. \\"100 Best Golf Courses Outside the United States\\" The magazine also compiles a list of the leading courses outside the United States. This is created using information from national golf associations, plus votes by the same panelists supplemented by some additional ones with international knowledge. In 2007, the most represented countries were Scotland with fourteen courses in the top 100, Canada with ten, England with ten, Canada with nine, and Australia and Republic of Ireland with eight. The top 10 were: # Royal County Down Golf Club – Newcastle, Northern Ireland # Old Course at St Andrews – St. Andrews, Scotland # Royal Dornoch Golf Club (Championship Course) – Dornoch, Scotland # Royal Portrush Golf Club (Dunluce Course) – Portrush, Northern Ireland # Muirfield – Gullane, Scotland # Royal Melbourne Golf Club (Composite Course) – Melbourne, Australia # Ballybunion Golf Club (Old Course) – Ballybunion, Ireland # Turnberry (Ailsa Course) – Ayrshire, Scotland # Carnoustie Golf Links – Carnoustie, Scotland # Cape Kidnappers Golf Course – Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand In 2005, the most represented countries were Scotland and Canada with thirteen courses each in the top 100. The top 10 were: # Old Course at St Andrews – St. Andrews, Scotland # Royal Melbourne Golf Club – Melbourne, Australia # Royal Portrush Golf Club – Portrush, Northern Ireland # Royal County Down Golf Club – Newcastle, Northern Ireland # Royal Dornoch Golf Club – Dornoch, Scotland # Muirfield – Gullane, Scotland # Ballybunion Golf Club – Ballybunion, Ireland # New South Wales Golf Club – Sydney, Australia # National Golf Club – Woodbridge, Ontario, Canada # St. George's Golf and Country Club – Toronto, Ontario, Canada Recognition In 2009, Golf Digest was nominated for a National Magazine Awards by the American Society of Magazine Editors in the Magazine Section in recognition of the excellence of a regular section of a magazine based on voice, originality and unified presentation. Controversy In April 2014, Golf Digest was widely criticized when, after neglecting to picture a female golfer on their cover for six years, they chose to picture model Paulina Gretzky in a revealing outfit as their May 2014 cover. The move was \\"particularly frustrating\\" to LPGA golfers. LPGA Tour Commissioner Mike Whan issued a statement echoing the concerns expressed by LPGA players. In the October 2014 edition, U.S. Women's Open winner Michelle Wie appeared on the cover. In May 2016, the magazine again featured a female celebrity in the cover, Paige Spiranac, which was criticized by veteran golfer Juli Inkster.Spiranac on Golf Digest cover irks some within LPGA – Randall Mell, Golf Channel, 20 April 2016 See also *Kingdom magazine ReferencesExternal links *Official site *Official site of Golf World magazine, a Golf Digest publication *Composite of all U.S. courses ever ranked *Official site for Golf Digest Golf Schools Category:1950 establishments in the United States Category:Discovery, Inc.

Hamilton (September 25, 1927 – September 30, 2016) was the chairman of The Hamilton Companies LLC, a loosely connected group of companies focused on oil production, real estate holdings and educational institutions. Frederic C. Hamilton founded Hamilton Oil Corporation in the late 1960s. He built it into an international oil company as well as a domestic gas company, both of which he merged into a major integrated oil company in the mid-1980s. At the time of his death Hamilton was the Chairman of The Hamilton Companies, which is active in venture capital, private equity, oil and gas, real estate, mortgage lending, securities and acquisitions operations. Fred Hamilton was inducted into the Colorado Business Hall of Fame by Junior Achievement-Rocky Mountain and the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce in 2010. Early life Hamilton was born in Columbus, Ohio, but spent much of his childhood in Springfield, Illinois. He was educated at Millbrook and Lawrenceville Schools and Babson College. He also served in the United States Air Force. Hamilton began his career as a roughneck and roustabout in the oil fields of Texas. Oil exploration Hamilton has been referred to as having been one of the United States’s oil pioneers. In 1950, he started Hamilton Brothers Drilling Company along with his brother Ferris, in Dallas, Texas with a $5,000 loan from their mother. Their success enabled them to expand into oil and gas exploration with a partnership known as Hamilton Brothers. In 1962, this became Hamilton Brothers Oil Company and the company moved to Denver. Hamilton's family have resided in Denver for more than 50 years. In the early '70s, Hamilton Brothers was the first company to find and produce oil in the North Sea. They drilled the first well in the East China Sea and later the first in the Barents Sea, offshore Russia. They also developed and used the first floating production system in the world. Philanthropy Hamilton served as the Chairman Emeritus of the Denver Art Museum (DAM) Board of Trustees. He served as the DAM's Vice Chairman beginning in 1984, became Chairman of the Board of Trustees in 1994 and acted as Co-Chairman with J. Landis (Lanny) Martin from July 2011 to January 2013. He guided the museum through several major milestones, most notably the planning, financing and construction of the Frederic C. Hamilton Building, designed by Daniel Libeskind. It first opened to the public in October 2006. Additionally, Hamilton led two major endowment campaigns for the DAM during his tenure, growing those assets to more than $100 million. He also helped lead the fundraising effort to complete the $110 million expansion project. In recognition of his long-time support, the museum named its 146,000-square-foot expansion, the Frederic C. Hamilton Building. Hamilton was a member of the Trustees Council of the National Gallery of Art, an alumni member of the Smithsonian Institution Board of Directors, on the Board of Trustees of the Denver Area Council Boy Scouts of America and President of the Graland Country Day School Foundation Board. He established endowed chairs in endocrinology, macular degeneration and skin cancer research at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and created endowments at NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical College for research and for clinical scholars. Fred always knew that the point of having is to give. Hamilton was a lifetime trustee at Graland Country Day School where several buildings bear his name, including the Frederic C. Hamilton Gymnasium https://issuu.com/graland/docs/digital-gtnov13-jan14 and classroom buildings named Hamilton West and Hamilton East.

He has written numerous articles on the topics of Mormon theology, philosophy, and thought.  Background  Blake Thomas Ostler was born in 1957 in Murray, Utah. Ostler served a mission to Milan, Italy from 1977 to 1979. He married Christine Edwards who he met while attending Brigham Young University. They have five children: Carina Wendy Heilner (Stephan), Corey Blake (Elizabeth), Jacob Edward (Marina), David Thomas (Amelia) and Chersten Nicole Wallentine (Jakob). In addition, Ostler and his wife Christine completed a Spanish speaking mission in Utah where he taught English and gave legal advice to immigrants and non-English speakers. Ostler received his B.A. in philosophy and B.S. in psychobiology in 1981 from Brigham Young University (BYU). He received his J.D. as a William Leary Scholar from the University of Utah in 1985. In each of his these degrees, Ostler graduated with honors. He is a practicing attorney specializing in education law, commercial litigation; franchise law and litigation, construction law and litigation, property and development law and litigation educational law, employment law and intellectual property. Ostler has published widely on Mormon philosophy in journals such as Religious Studies, International Journal for the Philosophy of Religion, Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, BYU Studies and the FARMS Review of Books. He is best known for his award winning and groundbreaking four volume series entitled Exploring Mormon Thought. The first volume, The Attributes of God, addresses the attributes of God from a Mormon perspective. Ostler argues that God cannot know what acts a person will freely do in the future. The first volume also expounds a Mormon Christology or theory of Christ as both fully human and fully divine at once. Ostler also assesses the attributes of divine power, divine mutability, divine pathos, divine temporality and human and divine nature. The second volume, The Love of God and the Problems of Theism, addresses Mormon soteriology or theory of salvation. Ostler addresses whether God's love can be properly called \\"unconditional\\" in Mormon thought. He also addresses the problems of petitionary prayer. He develops a theory of ethics based upon a modified agape theory of ethics. He then addresses and critiques salvation by grace in classic Christian thought. He develops a theory of human nature and sin departing from self-deception theory. He elucidates and exegetes several scriptural passages based upon self-deception as the underlying cause of the human condition of alienation. Ostler elucidates a \\"Compassion Theory of Atonement\\" and describes how free acceptance of Christ's gracious gift of divine light leads to interpersonal healing and overcoming alienation. He presents two arguments that creation ex nihilo (out of nothing) is logically incompatible with both libertarian and compatibilist views of free will. Finally he argues that Joseph Smith's \\"King Follett Discourse,\\" given 7 April 1844, has been misunderstood. He argues that Joseph Smith did not teach that God the Father became divine after not having been divine for an eternity prior to experiencing a mortality; but that Joseph Smith quoted John 5:29 to show that the Son did what the Father had done before him. Because Christ was fully divine before becoming mortal, it follows (he argues) that the Father must also have been fully divine before becoming mortal. The third volume, Of God and Gods, addresses the relation of the Israelite council of gods, the early Christian view of the Godhead and the angel of Yahweh, and finally analyzes the Mormon view of the Godhead as a social trinity that reconciles these views. Ostler relies on critical biblical scholarship to argue that what Joseph Smith's critics took to be theological innovations contrary to scripture are in fact a faithful understanding of the Hebrew scriptures. He elucidates the Near Eastern background of the biblical beliefs in a council of gods overseen by a Most High God. He also critiques the most prominent views of the Latin and Social Trinity. The fourth volume, Mormonism and the Problem of Evil, (due to be published in 2019) addresses the problem of evil. Ostler presents three different approaches to theodicy (explanation of why God allows evils) based upon three very different views of God's relation to the natural universe in Mormon thought—a naturalistic theodicy, a process theodicy and a Plan of Atonement theodicy. Ostler has also published a short volume relying on continental philosophers in the existential tradition Martin Buber and Søren Kierkegaard. Ostler also plans a fifth volume to address spiritual knowledge and epistemology. Ostler adopts an epistemology of \\"supra-verbal\\" experiential knowledge and subjectivity (following the Danish philosopher Søren Kiekegaard and the German philosopher Immanuel Kant) to elucidate a theory of religious knowledge. It also addresses the problems arising from competing claims among various world religions. Ostler argues that Mormonism adopts a form of soteriological and epistemological Inclusivism as a solution to the latter problem. Ostler accepts the Book of Mormon as an actual historical account, but as edited and expanded in light of Joseph Smith's vocabulary and capacity for expression within his world view. He argues that it is a modern expansion of an ancient document.See Blake Ostler, \\"The Book of Mormon as a Modern Expansion of an Ancient Source,\\" Dialogue 20:1 (Spring 1987) 66-123 review of New Approaches to the Book of Mormon: Explorations in Critical Methodology, by John A. Tvedtnes in FARMS Review Because Ostler adopts the Expansion Theory, he affirms that the Book of Mormon was translated through the gift of God and reflects a revelation of the content of an ancient source though we have access only to its modern translation. Ostler currently practices in Salt Lake City.

It was established by the Pala Emperor Gopala I in the 8th century. It is considered the second oldest of India's Mahaviharas after Nalanda University and was situated in Magadha. Acharya Ganga jee of Vikramashila was a student at this Mahavihara. According to the Tibetan records there were about 12,000 students at Odantapuri which was situated at a mountain called Hiranya Prabhat Parvat and by the bank of the river Panchanan. In the modern era, it is situated in Bihar Sharif, headquarters of Nalanda district. History In a Tibetan history of the Kalachakra tantra by Ngakwang Künga Sönam, 27th Sakya Trizin (,1597–1659), it is mentioned that Odantapuri was administered by \\"Sendha-pa\\", the Tibetan referent for a Śrāvakayāna Buddhist school. According to the Tibetan historian Tāranātha, King Mahāpāla supported 500 Śrāvakasaṅgha bhikshus at Odantapuri. As an annex to this monastery, he built a monastery called Uruvasa, where he supported 500 Sendha-pa or Sendhava Sravaka.Chattopadhyaya, Alaka and Chimpa, Lama, translators. Tāranātha’s History of Buddhism in India, Motilal Books UK, . 2000: 289. During the reign of King Rāmapāla, a thousand monks, belonging to both Hinayana and Mahayana, lived in Odantapuri and occasionally even twelve thousand monks congregated there.Chattopadhyaya, Alaka and Chimpa, Lama, translators. Tāranātha’s History of Buddhism in India, Motilal Books UK, . 2000: 313. According to Peter Skilling, the \\"Sendha-pa\\" Śrāvaka-s could possibly have been Sāmmatīya-s since the probable derivation of \\"Sendha-pa\\" is from the Sanskrit saindhava or ‘residents of Sindh’ where the Sāmmatīya-s were the predominant school.Skilling, Peter. “The Saṃskṛtāsaṃskṛtaviniṣcaya of Daśabalaśrīmitra”, Buddhist Studies Review, Vol. 4, No. 1, 1987: 3–23, p. 16. Tāranātha links the Sendhapa or Sendhava Śrāvaka monks at the Mahabodhi at Bodhgaya to the “Singha Island”, i.e. Sri Lanka, and “other places”.Chattopadhyaya, Alaka and Chimpa, Lama, translators. Tāranātha’s History of Buddhism in India, Motilal Books UK, . 2000: 279. A number of monasteries grew up during the Pala period in ancient Bengal and Magadha. According to Tibetan sources, five great mahaviharas stood out: Vikramashila, the premier university of the era; Nalanda, past its prime but still illustrious, Somapura Mahavihara, Odantapuri, and Jagaddala.Vajrayogini: Her Visualization, Rituals, and Forms by Elizabeth English. Wisdom Publications. pg 15 The five monasteries formed a network; \\"all of them were under state supervision\\" and there existed \\"a system of co-ordination among them . . it seems from the evidence that the different seats of Buddhist learning that functioned in eastern India under the Pala were regarded together as forming a network, an interlinked group of institutions,\\" and it was common for great scholars to move easily from position to position among them.Buddhist Monks And Monasteries Of India: Their History And Contribution To Indian Culture. by Sukumar Dutt, George Allen and Unwin Ltd, London 1962. pg 352-3 The university perished, along with Nalanda, at the hands of Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji around 1193.

The amount of the tax is in proportion to the amount subject to taxation.Sommerfeld, Ray M., Silvia A. Madeo, Kenneth E. Anderson, Betty R. Jackson (1992), Concepts of Taxation, Dryden Press: Fort Worth, TX \\"Proportional\\" describes a distribution effect on income or expenditure, referring to the way the rate remains consistent (does not progress from \\"low to high\\" or \\"high to low\\" as income or consumption changes), where the marginal tax rate is equal to the average tax rate.Hyman, David M. (1990) Public Finance: A Contemporary Application of Theory to Policy, 3rd, Dryden Press: Chicago, ILJames, Simon (1998) A Dictionary of Taxation, Edgar Elgar Publishing Limited: Northampton, MA It can be applied to individual taxes or to a tax system as a whole; a year, multi- year, or lifetime. Proportional taxes maintain equal tax incidence regardless of the ability-to-pay and do not shift the incidence disproportionately to those with a higher or lower economic well-being. Flat taxes are defined as levying a fixed (“flat”) fraction of taxable income. They usually exempt from taxation household income below a statutorily determined level that is a function of the type and size of the household. As a result, such a flat marginal rate is consistent with a progressive average tax rate. A progressive tax is a tax imposed so that the tax rate increases as the amount subject to taxation increases.Webster (4b): increasing in rate as the base increases (a progressive tax)American Heritage (6). Increasing in rate as the taxable amount increases.Britannica Concise Encyclopedia: Tax levied at a rate that increases as the quantity subject to taxation increases. The opposite of a progressive tax is a regressive tax, where the tax rate decreases as the amount subject to taxation increases. The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789 proclaims:  Proportional rates  Proportional taxes on consumption are considered by some to be regressive; that is, low-income people tend to spend a greater percentage of their income in taxable sales (using a cross section timeframe) than higher income people. A regressive tax is when the average tax rate is lower, with higher income. So income and average tax rate have an inverse relationship. However, this calculation is derived when the tax paid is divided not by the tax base (the amount spent) but by income, which is argued to create an arbitrary relationship. The income tax rate itself is proportional, with people with higher incomes paying more tax but at the same rate. If a consumption tax is to be related to income, the unspent income can be treated as tax-deferred (spending savings at a later point in time), at which time it is taxed creating a proportional rate using an income base. However, consumption taxes such as a sales tax can often exclude items or provide rebates in an effort to create social justice.

His occupation was listed as carpenter. Life Lucas was born in Leatherhead, Surrey, England, to parents John Lucas & Mary Bradford in 1764. Lucas was tried at the Old Bailey, London on 7 July 1784 for feloniously stealing clothing with a value of 40 shillings. Lucas was sentenced to transportation for seven years and left England on the Scarborough in May 1787. Norfolk Island After the First Fleet arrived at Port Jackson in January 1788, Phillip ordered Lieutenant Philip Gidley King to lead a party of fifteen convicts (9 men and 6 women) and seven free men to take control of Norfolk Island and prepare for its commercial development. Lucas was aboard , which arrived at Norfolk on 6 March 1788. On board Supply Nathaniel met Olivia Gascoigne (b. 1763 - d. 12 Jun 1830) whom he married on 5 November 1791, on Norfolk Island. Nathaniel and Olivia had thirteen children, although twins (Sarah and Mary) were killed at the age of two years when a large Norfolk Island Pine fell on the Lucas house. In 1791 he received a grant of and in 1793 purchased another from Charles Heritage, a former marine. Lucas took up farming and in August 1802 sold wheat, maize and pork worth £450 to the government stores on the island. On 22 May, 1802, Lucas was appointed Master Carpenter at Norfolk Island. New South Wales In April 1805, Lucas returned with his family to Sydney in the Investigator.

He spent his career at Abbott Laboratories working his way from staff chemist to CEO. He was a pioneer in the field of anesthetic pharmacology, assisting in the development of two breakthrough drugs, Nembutal and Pentothal. Volwiler also helped Abbott Laboratories to achieve commercial success for its pharmaceutical products including the commercialization of penicillin and sulfa drugs during World War II. Early life and education Ernest Henry Volwiler was born on August 22, 1893 to Mr. and Mrs. Jacob Volwiler of Hamilton, Ohio, German-speaking immigrants. They lived on a farm near the intersection of Layhigh and Robinson roads in Morgan Township, Butler County, Ohio. As a child, Volwiler and his brother Albert Tangeman Volwiler attended a one-room schoolhouse. Later, Ernest attended Morgan Twp. High School in Okeana, Ohio, graduating in 1909. He then spent a year teaching in a country school, to earn money for university. Volwiler received a bachelor's degree from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio in 1914. He became interested in chemistry after attending a lecture by John C. Hessler of James Milliken University, Decatur, Ill. He went on to receive a master's degree and Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Illinois in 1916 and 1918. Volwiler was Roger Adams' first doctoral student. Starting in 1915 as a summer student, Volwiler worked with Clarence Derick's Organic Chemical Manufactures unit at the University of Illinois, learning to make and sell chemicals that had previously been imported from Germany. From 1916 to 1917 Volwiler served as Chemist-in-Charge of Organic Chemical Manufactures. From 1917 to 1918 he was a Fellow in Chemistry at the University of Illinois. Abbott Laboratories Recruited by Wallace C. Abbott, Volwiler joined Abbott Laboratories as a research chemist in 1918. Volwiler became Chief Chemist in 1920 and Director of Research in 1930. From 1933 to 1946 he acted as Vice President of Research and Development. From 1946 to 1950 he became Executive Vice President of Abbott Laboratories, and from 1950 to 1958, President and General Manager. In 1958 he became Chairman of the Board, retiring in 1961. Abbott Laboratories produced significant financial returns during his tenure as CEO. =Barbital= His first job at Abbott Laboratories was to recreate the German sedative Veronal, for use in World War I hospitals. Volwiler was able to meet the demand, successfully synthesizing Barbital and overseeing its production in spite of shortages of time, people and equipment. = Nembutal = Volwiler was a pioneer in the field of anesthetic pharmacology, assisting in the development of two breakthrough drugs, the barbiturates Nembutal and Pentothal. Nembutal, developed by Ernest H. Volwiler and Donalee L. Tabern of Abbott Laboratories in 1930, was a novel barbiturate that could induce sleep within 20 minutes. It had the advantage of rarely producing hangovers or other side effects. An oral-hypnotic barbiturate, Nembutal has a long narcotic duration, with attendant risk of abuse. = Pentothal = In 1934, Volwiler and Tabern synthesized the first intravenous general anesthetic, Sodium thiopental, in 1934. In the mid 1930s, Volwiler and Tabern spent three years screening over 200 candidate compounds in search of a substance which could be injected directly into the blood stream to produce unconsciousness. They eventually discovered that 5-ethyl-5-(1-methylbutyl)-2-thiobarbituric acid, a sulfur-bearing analogue of Nembutal, was fast, effective and lacked side effects such as twitching or delirium. Sodium thiopental was first used in humans on 8 March 1934 by Ralph M. Waters in an investigation of its properties, which were short-term anesthesia and surprisingly little analgesia. Three months later, John Silas Lundy started clinical trials of thiopental at the Mayo Clinic at the request of Abbott Laboratories. Volwiler and Tabern were awarded U.S. Patent No. 2,153,729 in 1939 for the discovery of thiopental. Pentothal's discovery revolutionized intravenous anesthesia. The anesthetic can quickly put patients to sleep for a short period of time to relieve the discomfort of surgery or other medical procedures, or to allow physicians to administer longer lasting, inhalable anesthetics. As well as being easy to use it is relatively safe to handle: fireproof, non-explosive and easily transported. The dangers of cardio-depressant effects and overdose due to repeated use were soon discovered. During World War II, 78% of patients received Pentothal anaesthetic, with a mortality rate of 0.018%. Pentothal has sometimes been referred to as a \\"truth serum\\", because it can cause people to talk freely. For a time after World War II Pentothal was valued in some forms of psychotherapy for this disinhibiting effect. There is no guarantee, however, that what is reported is reliable, and such results have been rejected as evidence in court. = Sulfa drugs and Penicillin = Volwiler helped Abbott Laboratories to achieve commercial success for its pharmaceutical products including the commercialization of sulfa drugs and penicillin during World War II. Abbott was one of five companies enlisted in 1941 by the U. S. government to develop penicillin. = Wartime Intelligence = At the end of World War II, Volwiler was asked to visit German chemistry facilities on an intelligence mission to assess the types and extent of Germans chemical technology. Following just days after the Allied troops, he viewed bombed industrial facilities and talked to German scientists. Volwiler did not find the scientists difficult to speak with, remembering \\"Oh, they were scared to death and they were very cooperative.\\" The visit yielded important information, previously unknown, about the types of chemicals being used in German chemical warfare. =Later career= In the 1940s and 1950s, Volmiler led the company as it expanded into areas such as radiopharmaceuticals., the treatment of epilepsy, and the development of the non-caloric sweetener Sucaryl for use in diabetic diets. He retired in 1961. From 1958 to 1964, Volwiler served a six-year term on the National Science Board, appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The NSB is the 24-member governing board of the National Science Foundation. Philanthropy Volwiler was an active community leader and philanthropist serving, among others, on the boards of Lake Forest College and the Phi Kappa Tau Foundation. He served on the Board of Regents helping to establish the United States National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland in 1959. He made major philanthropic gifts to his alma maters, Miami University and the University of Illinois. In 1983 he donated $250,000 to Miami University to create a research professorship, the Ernest H. Volwiler Distinguished Research Professor in Chemistry, which has been awarded every three years beginning in 1984. In 1989 he contributed an additional $450,000 to endow a chair in the chemistry department. He also established Ernest H. Volwiler Distinguished Scientist Lectureship and the Ernest H. Volwiler Chair in Natural Sciences and Mathematics at Lake Forest College, Lake Forest, Ill., where he had been a trustee. Following Ernest Volwiler's death, the Ernest H. and Lillian H. Volwiler Fund was created at the Chicago Community Trust to be used in support of education. Awards and honors Volwiler received honorary degrees from Northwestern University, Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, St. Louis College of Pharmacy, Southwestern at Memphis, Coe College, Knox College and Lake Forest College. Other honors include the IRI Medal from the Industrial Research Institute in 1955, the American Chemical Society's Priestley Medal in 1958, and the American Institute of Chemists Gold Medal in 1960. Volwiler and Tabern were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1986 for their work on Pentothal. The American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy gives the Volwiler Research Achievement Award in Volwiler's memory. Abbott established the Volwiler Society in his honor in 1985 to recognize the company's most distinguished scientists and engineers.  Family  Volwiler's brother was the noted Ohio University historian, Albert T. Volwiler. Ernest Volwiler married Lillian F. Huggler (1894-1991) in 1920. The couple were survived by two daughters and a son.

(In Portuguese) An extensive notice of his life and thought (Vita) was written by his nephew, a canon of Évora also named Jerónimo Osório, to introduce his edition of his uncle's Complete Works (dedicated to King Philip I of Portugal) published in 1592.'Hieronymi Osorii Lusitani Vita auctore Hieronymo Osorio nepote', in Hieronymi Osorii Lusitani Episcopi Algarbiensis Opera Omnia, Hieronymi Osorii Nepotis Canonici Eborensis Diligentia in unum collecta et in quatuor volumina distributa (ex bibliotheca Georgii Ferrarii, Romae; ex typographia Bartholomaei Bonfadini, Romae; ex typographia Gabiana, Romae 1592), Volume I, pages 1–19 (separate pagination). (In Latin). F.A. Lobo apparently depends upon this. LifeYoung life and education= Osório was a native of Lisbon and one of two sons of João Osório de Fonseca, and Francisca, daughter of Affonso Gil de Gouveia, Ouvidor of the lands of the Infante Ferdinand,Lobo, 'Jerónimo Osório', p. 294. both families of aristocratic lineage. His father, appointed by John III to be Ouvidor Geral (Auditor-GeneralN.R. Madhava Menon (ed.), Criminal Justice India Series, Vol. 9, Goa 2002 (Allied Publishers, 2003), p. 56.) of Portuguese rule in India, went alone, and there found himself under the authority of Vasco da Gama.Osorio, Vita Auctoris, p. 1. Jerónimo, at school in Portugal, showed such prodigious ability in Latin that in 1519, when aged 13, his mother sent him to Salamanca in Spain to study civil law.Osorio, Vita Auctoris, p. 1. Two years later, with further fluency in Latin and Greek, he returned home wanting to make a military career with the Knights Hospitaller in Rhodes: his father sent him back to Salamanca, where he worked to strengthen and discipline both body and mind for that calling when his father's objections should be overcome.Osorio, Vita Auctoris, pp. 1–2. But he developed strongly devotional feelings, and on his father's death his mother persuaded him to give up military ambitions.Osorio, Vita Auctoris, pp. 1–2. In 1525, aged 19, he went to Paris to study Aristotelian logic and Natural philosophy.Osorio, Vita Auctoris, pp. 2–3. There he became a near associate of Peter Faber, who with his companion Francis Xavier and others was then drawing close to Ignatius of Loyola.Osorio, Vita Auctoris, p. 3. Returning to Portugal to settle his affairs, Osório next proceeded for Theology to Bologna, immersing himself in the Church Fathers (particularly Gregory Nazianzen, St Basil, John Chrysostom, Augustine of Hippo and St Jerome) and St Thomas Aquinas and making a higher study of Cicero, Demosthenes and Plato.Osorio, Vita Auctoris, p. 3. His Neoplatonic leanings were nourished by the Corpus Areopagiticum, the author of which he considered, next to the Apostles, to be the prince of theologians.Osorio, Vita Auctoris, p. 3. He made such a name that King John III invited him in 1536–1537 to lecture in the reorganized University of Coimbra, where he expounded on Isaiah and on St Paul's Epistle to the Romans.Lobo, 'Jerónimo Osório', p. 295. =De Nobilitate= Returning to Lisbon in 1540 he became secretary to Prince Luís, and tutor to his son António (afterwards Prior of Crato), obtaining also two benefices in the diocese of Viseu. Before the age of 30 he had begun his twin treatises De Nobilitate Civili and De Nobilitate Christiana: their publication in Lisbon in 1542 rapidly won him international acclaim.Hieronymi Osorij Lusitani, De Nobilitate Ciuili, libri duo; (eiusdem) De Nobilitate Christiana, libri tres (Ludovicum Rodericum [Luis Rodrigues], Olyssipone [Lisbon] 1542). Opera Omnia (1592), Vol. 1, pp. 1–36, 37–112. His mastery of Latin style earned him the name \\"The Portuguese Cicero\\".

He was named archdeacon of Évora in 1560, and much against his will became Bishop of Silves, the diocese of the Algarve, in 1564.Prestage, Encyclopedia Britannica 1911. =The English question= As Osório had denounced Machiavelli, so in addressing England he could denounce the influence of Martin Luther and Martin Bucer.E.F. Hirsch, Damião de Gois: The Life and Thought of a Portuguese Humanist, 1502–1574, International Archives of the History of Ideas, 19 (Martinus Nijhoff, The Hague 1967), pp. 182–84. As the Council of Trent drew towards its close, in 1562, at the prompting of Cardinal Henrique,Osório was reputedly moved to this by a dream in which, while fishing from the promontory, he caught a sea monster: brought to the beach, it turned into a beautiful woman wearing a royal crown, who kneeling at his feet begged for baptism. Osórius, Vita Auctoris, p. 5. Osório published a Latin epistle to Queen Elizabeth urging her to return to the Roman Catholic communion and to accept papal authority.Latin texts in A.

In 1571 his extensive History of the reign of King Emmanuel was published at Lisbon,De Rebus Emmanuelis Regis Lusitaniae Invictissimi Virtute et Auspicio Gestis, libri duodecim, auctore Hieronimo Osorio Episcopo Sylvensi (Apud Antonium Gondisaluum Typographum, Olyssipone 1571) Cum Privilegio Regio. which rendered in his accomplished Latin much of the material in the Chronicle on the same subject by Damião de Góis.D. de Góis, Crónica do Felicíssimo Rei Dom Emanuel (casa de Françisco Correa, Lisboa 1566–67) digitized (Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal). Encompassing the adventures of Vasco da Gama, it coincided with the publication of Os Lusíadas, The Lusiads, of his great contemporary Luís Vaz de Camões.L. de Camões, Os Lusíadas (casa de Antonio Gõçaluez, Lisboa 1572) digitized (Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal). He further showed his zeal for the commonwealth by writing two letters, one seeking to dissuade the King from going to Africa, and the other sent during the latter's first expedition there calling upon him to return to his kingdom.Osorio, Vita Auctoris, pp. 14–15. Sebastian looked with disfavour on opponents of his African adventure, and Osório found it prudent to leave Portugal for Parma and Rome to make a visit ad limina. His scruples regarding residence, and the appeals of the King and the Cardinal Prince, prevented him from long enjoying the hospitality of Pope Gregory XIII.L. Bourdon, 'Le voyage de Jerónimo Osório évêque de Silves en Italie (1576–77)', Annales publiées par la Faculté de Lettres de Toulouse (1951). He therefore returned to his diocese, the seat of which was transferred from Silves to Faro in 1577,J.A. Pinheiro e Rosa, 'A Diocese do Algarve e a Universidade de Coimbra', Revista da Universidade de Coimbra XXXVII (1992), pp. 77–91, at p. 78. and continued there through the brief reign of the Cardinal King. He died at Tavira on 20 August 1580.Encyclopedia Britannica, which follows F.A. Lobo, which follows Osorio, Auctoris Vita. =The library= Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex Haddon said of him that \\"he was a most perverse, overthwart Brawler, who besides a commendable Facility in the Latin Tongue, could profit the Publick nothing at all.\\"Strype, Annals of the Reformation, I, p. 422. It has been said that his library was carried off from Faro when the Earl of Essex, returning from the Capture of Cádiz, raided the town in 1596.(Encyclopedia Britannica). See Lytton Strachey, Elizabeth and Essex, A Tragic History (Chatto & Windus, London 1928), pp. 104–115. The library taken by the Earl was that of Dom Fernando Martins Mascarenhas, then Bishop of Faro, whose house Essex occupied during the raid: it is said to have included many of Osorio's books.J.B. Silva Lopes, Memorias para a Historia Ecclesiastica do Bispado do Algarve (Lisboa 1848), p. 369. In 1600 Essex gave some 200 volumes to the Bodleian Library (then in the care of Thomas Bodley) in Oxford, none of which bear the signature of Bishop Osório.K.M. Pogson, 'A Grand Inquisitor, and his Library' (together with 'A list of books presented by the Earl of Essex in 1600, still in the Bodleian'), The Bodleian Quarterly Record III (Oxford 1922), pp. 239–44. It is possible however that the early codex of Tomé Pires' Suma Oriental and the Book of the cartographer Francisco Rodrigues, among the French National Manuscript Collections, belonged to Osório.A. Cortesao (ed.), The Suma Oriental of Tomé Pires (etc), 2 vols (Hakluyt Society, London 1944), (introduction p. xv, & note).

Its primary purpose is hydroelectric power generation and its power station has an installed capacity of 3,015 MW. Construction of the dam began in 1961 and the power station's first generator was commissioned in 1972. The last generator was commissioned in 1979 and the entire project was completed in 1980 when Tajikistan was still a republic within the Soviet Union, becoming the tallest dam in the world at the time. At , it is currently the second tallest man-made dam in the world, after being surpassed by Jinping-I Dam in 2013. The Rogun Dam, also along the Vakhsh in Tajikistan, may exceed it in size when completed. Construction The Nurek Dam was constructed by the Soviet Union between the years 1961 and 1980. It is uniquely constructed, with a central core of cement forming an impermeable barrier within a -high rock and earth fill construction. The volume of the mound is 54 million m3. The dam includes nine hydroelectric generating units, the first commissioned in 1972 and the last in 1979. An estimated 5,000 people were resettled from the dam's flooding area. The dam is located in a deep gorge along the Vakhsh River in western Tajikistan, about east of the nation's capital of Dushanbe. A town near the dam, also called Nurek, houses engineers and other workers employed at the dam's power plant. Electricity generation A total of nine Francis turbine-generators are installed in the Nurek Dam's power station. Originally having a generating capacity of 300 MW each (2,700 MW total), they were redesigned and retrofitted between 1984 and 1988 so now have a capacity of 335 MW each (3,015 MW total). As of 1994, this formed most of the nation's 4.0 gigawatt hydroelectric generating capacity, which was adequate to meet 98% of the nation's electricity needs. Reservoir thumb The reservoir formed by the Nurek Dam, known simply as Nurek, is the largest reservoir in Tajikistan with a capacity of 10.5 km3. The reservoir is over in length, and has a surface area of . The reservoir drives the hydroelectric plant located within the dam. Stored water is also used for irrigation of agricultural land. Irrigation water is transported 14 kilometers through the Dangara irrigation tunnel and is used to irrigate about of farmland. It is suspected that the reservoir may have caused induced seismicity when being impounded.

It was founded on September 22, 1989 in Paris, France, following the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests. The group has members all over the world, including mainland China. Active members are located in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Thailand and in other European and Asian countries. The group was very active in the five years following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and has been substantially reinvigorated and active since 2003 with large congresses attracting a broad cross-section of leading Chinese Democracy Activists and exiles. In 2005 Chen Yonglin, then Chinese consulate-general working in Sydney, defected to the Australian government by a formal claim for political asylum. Chen claimed that a network of 1,000 Chinese government spies were operating in Australia, leading the chairman of the Australian branch of the FDC to comment that such claims could \\"lead to [an] atmosphere of distrust and even antagonism towards the Chinese community.\\" On October 8, 2012, during the 11th Congress of FDC, Sheng Xue, who lives in Canada was elected as the President of the FDC. She was the first female president of the FDC, and the first female president of any major organization in the overseas Chinese pro-democracy movement. On March 24, 2017, during the 13th Congress of FDC, Chin Jin, who lives in Australia, was elected as President. Jin Xiuhong of the United States, Sheng Xue of Canada, Wang Dai of Japan and Zhang Jian of France were all elected as Vice- Presidents, and Luo Le from Canada was elected as the Chair of the Supervisory Committee. Other former Presidents of the FDC include Yan Jiaqi and Wan Runnan, who both lived in France during the FDC's initial stages and later moved to the United States.

The scientific name is derived from the Greek words odon (tooth) and glossa (tongue), referring to the two tooth-like calluses on the base of the lip. This genus of cool to cold growing orchids is to be found on open spots in the humid cloud forest at higher elevations from Central- and West South America to Guyana, with most species around the northern Andes. The abbreviation for this genus is Odm. in the horticultural trade. Most are sympodial epiphytes, or rarely terrestrials. The pseudobulbs are compact with leaf-like bracts at the base. They give one to three apical leaves. An arching (and sometimes erect) inflorescence grows from its base. The ruffled sepals and petals of these spectacular flowers are spreading. The lip is rather complex, entire or with three lobes. It stands erect or parallel to the long column. The high altitude species show long inflorescences with up to 150 flowers (as in O. cirrhosum), while the lower altitude species have shorter inflorescences with up to 20 flowers. These flowers may be white, red, purple, brown, yellow, or even be blotched with a showy blend of many colors. Many of these species are in great demand with orchid lovers because of their spectacular and flamboyant flowers.  Species  This genus used to contain more than 400 species. Many have now been reclassified in other genera such as Amparoa, Aspasia, Cochlioda, Cuitlauzina, Cyrtochilum, Gomesa, Lemboglossum, Mesoglossum, Miltonia, Miltonioides, Oliveriana, Oncidium, Osmoglossum, Otoglossum, Rhynchostele, Rossioglossum and Ticoglossum. This new genera occurred outside the Andes in different climatological habitats. There is some debate going on whether Odontoglossum is a separate genus or if most or even all species should be included in Oncidium. If the latter opinion is followed (see Genera Orchidacearum by Alec M. Pridgeon, Phillip J. Cribb, Mark W. Chase, and Finn N. Rasmussen) most species in the list below are actually called Oncidiums. The following list gives the presently accepted names. There are six subgenera : Erectolobata, Lindleyana, Nevadensia, Odontoglossum, Serratolaminata and Unguisepala. * Odontoglossum alberti P.Ortiz 2005 (Colombia) * Odontoglossum alvarezii P.Ortiz 2001 (Colombia) * Odontoglossum ariasii Dalström 2001 (Peru) * Odontoglossum armatum Rchb.f. 1876 : Armed Odontoglossum (Ecuador) * Odontoglossum aspidorhinum F.Lehm. 1895 : Shield- leather Odontoglossum (Colombia to Ecuador) * Odontoglossum astranthum Linden & Rchb.f. 1867 (Ecuador to Peru) * Odontoglossum aurarium (Rchb.f.)

The hybrids with red pigmentation are nearly all derived from a crossing with the genus Cochlioda and especially with Cochlioda noezliana.

The figure's significance is unknown, but it is usually interpreted as some kind of great spirit or master of animals. The unusual nature of The Sanctuary's decoration may also reflect the practice of magical ceremonies in the chamber. In his sketches of the cave art, Henri Breuil drew a horned humanoid torso and the publication of this drawing in the 1920sHenri Breuil, Quatre cent siècles d'art paiétal (Montignac, 1954, p. 166 (Mary E. Boyle, tr., as Four Hundred centuries of Cave Art, London: Zwemmer, 1952); Breuil, Les Cavernes du Volp, 1958. influenced many subsequent theories about the figure.As S. G. F.

Brandon, \\"The Ritual Perpetuation of the Past\\" Numen 6.2 (April 1959:112-129) p. 112. However, Breuil's sketch has also come under criticism in recent years.Hutton, Ronald Witches, Druids, Arthur. p. 34 A single prominent human figure is unusual in the cave paintings of the Upper Paleolithic, where the great majority of representations are of animals.  Breuil's drawing  Henri Breuil asserted that the cave painting represented a shaman or magician — an interpretation which gives the image its name — and described the image he drew in these terms. Margaret Murray having seen the published drawing called Breuil's image 'the first depiction of a deity on earth', an idea which Breuil and others later adopted. His views held sway in the field for much of the 20th century, but they have since been largely superseded. Breuil's image has been commonly interpreted as a shaman performing a ritual to ensure good hunting.Jean Clottes and David Lewis- Williams The Shamans of Prehistory: Trance and Magic in the Painted Caves Critique Certain modern scholars question the validity of Breuil's sketch, claiming that modern photographs do not show the famous antlers. Ronald Hutton theorized that Breuil was fitting the evidence to support his hunting-magic theory of cave-art, citing that \\"the figure drawn by Breuil is not the same as the one actually painted on the cave wall.\\" Hutton's theory led him to conclude that reliance on Breuil's initial sketch resulted in many later scholars erroneously claiming that \\"The Sorcerer\\" was evidence that the concept of a Horned God dated back to Paleolithic times. Likewise, Peter Ucko concluded that inaccuracies in the drawing were caused by Breuil's working in dim gas-light, in awkward circumstances, and that he had mistaken cracks in the rock surface for man-made marks.Ucko, P, (1992). Subjectivity and the recording of Palaeolithic Cave Art, in T Shay & J Clottes (eds), The Limitations of Archaeological Knowledge, 141-180. Liege: University of Liege Press However, this ignores the well-known fact that prehistoric art figures commonly use accidents in the material's surface (bumps, holes, cracks...) as part of their shape, in many occasions drawing only the lines needed to complete the figure; a technique reinforced with the optical effects brought by flickering fire light.

Also, \\"the Sorcerer\\" is composed of both charcoal drawings and etching within the stone itself; details, such as etching, are often difficult to view from photographs due to their size and the quality of the light source. Particularly celebrated prehistorian Jean Clottes asserts that Breuil's sketch is accurate ('I have seen it myself perhaps 20 times over the years'). Continuing influence The general assessment has placed the figure as central to an understanding of cave art: as S.G.F. Brandon expressed it in 1959, \\"it seems to be generally agreed that this picture of the 'Dancing Sorcerer' was a cult object of great significance to the community which used the cave.\\"S.G.F. Brandon, \\"The Ritual Perpetuation of the Past\\" Numen 6.2 (April 1959:112-129) p. 112 Popular culture Breuil's interpretation of the drawing as a shaman strongly influenced writer Pat Mills in the creation of the Lord Weird Slough Feg, a sorcerer, god, and early antagonist of the ongoing comic book title Slaine.\\"The Origins\\" (two- page text article), 2000 AD #352, 1984 The novel The Story of B by Daniel Quinn includes an interpretation of the painting as an expression of late Paleolithic animism, a symbol for the human sense of identity with other animal life.

In the past, channels were generally implemented with custom devices, variously named channel, I/O processor, I/O controller, or DMA controller.  Overview  Many I/O tasks can be complex and require logic to be applied to the data to convert formats and other similar duties. In these situations, the simplest solution is to ask the CPU to handle the logic, but because I/O devices are relatively slow, a CPU could waste time (in computer perspective) waiting for the data from the device. This situation is called 'I/O bound'. Channel architecture avoids this problem by using a logically independent, low-cost facility. Channel processors are simple, but self-contained, with minimal logic and sufficient scratchpad memory (working storage) to handle I/O tasks. They are typically not powerful or flexible enough to be used as a computer on their own and can be construed as a form of coprocessor. On some systems the channels use memory or registers addressable by the central processor as their scratchpad memory, while on other systems it is present in the channel hardware. A CPU designates a block of storage or sends a relatively small channel programs to the channel in order to handle I/O tasks, which the channel and controller can, in many cases, complete without further intervention from the CPU (exception: those channel programs which utilize 'program controlled interrupts', PCIs, to facilitate program loading, demand paging and other essential system tasks). When I/O transfer is complete or an error is detected, the controller communicates with the CPU through the channel using an interrupt. Since the channel has direct access to the main memory, it is also often referred to as a direct memory access (DMA) controller. In the most recent implementations, the channel program is initiated and the channel processor performs all required processing until either an ending condition. This eliminates much of the CPU—Channel interaction and greatly improves overall system performance. The channel may report several different types of ending conditions, which may be unambiguously normal, may unambiguously indicate an error or whose meaning may depend on the context and the results of a subsequent sense operation. In some systems an I/O controller can request an automatic retry of some operations without CPU intervention. In earlier implementations, any error, no matter how small, required CPU intervention, and the overhead was, consequently, much higher. A program-controlled interruption (PCI) is still supported for certain \\"legacy\\" operations, but the trend is to move away from such PCIs, except where unavoidable.  History  The first use of channel I/O was with the IBM 709 vacuum tube mainframe, whose Model 766 Data Synchronizer was the first channel controller, in 1957. Its transistorized successor, the IBM 7090, had two to eight 6-bit channels (the 7607) and a channel multiplexor (the 7606) which could control up to eight channels. The 7090 and 7094 could also have up to eight 8-bit channels with the 7909. While IBM used data channel commands on some of its computers, and allowed command chaining on, e.g., the 7090, most other vendors used channels that dealt with single records. However, some systems, e.g., GE-600 series, had more sophisticated I/O architectures. Later, for larger IBM System/360 computers, and even for early System/370 models, the selector channels and the multiplexor channels still were bulky and expensive separate processors, such as the IBM 2860 Selector channel (one to three selector channels in a single box), the IBM 2870 Byte multiplexor channel (one multiplexer channel, and, optionally, one selector subchannel in a single box) and the IBM 2880 Block multiplexor channel (one or two block multiplexor channels in a single box). Amdahl Corporation's hardware implementation of System/370 compatible channels was quite different. A single internal unit, called the \\"C-Unit\\", supported up to sixteen channels using the very same hardware for all supported channels. Two internal \\"C-Units\\" were possible, supporting up to 32 total channels. Each \\"C-Unit\\" independently performed a process generally called a \\"shifting channel state processor\\" (a type of barrel processor), which implemented a specialized finite state machine (FSM). Each CPU cycle, every 32 nanoseconds in the 470/V6 and /V5 and every 26 nanoseconds in the 470/V7 and /V8, the \\"C-unit\\" read the complete status of next channel in priority sequence and its I/O Channel in-tags. The necessary actions defined by that channel's last state and its in-tags were performed: data was read from or written to main storage, the operating system program was interrupted if such interruption was specified by the channel program's Program Control Interrupt flag, and the \\"C-Unit\\" finally stored that channel's next state and set its I/O Channel out- tags, and then went on to the next lower priority channel. Preemption was possible, in some instances. Sufficient FIFO storage was provided within the \\"C-Unit\\" for all channels which were emulated by this FSM. Channels could be easily reconfigured to the customer's choice of IBM 2860 (selector) emulation, IBM 2870 (byte multiplexor) emulation, or IBM 2880 (block multiplexor) emulation without any significant restrictions by using maintenance console commands. \\"Two-byte interface\\" was also supported as was \\"Data-In/Data-Out\\" and other high-performance IBM channel options. Built-in channel-to-channel adapters were also offered, called CCAs in Amdahl-speak, but called CTCs in IBM-speak. A real game-changer, and this forced IBM to redesign its mainframes to provide similar channel capability and flexibility. IBM's initial response was to include stripped-down Model 158s, operating in \\"Channel Mode\\", only, as the Model 303x channel units. In the Amdahl \\"C-unit\\" any channel could be any type, 2860, 2870, or 2880, without reserving channels 0 and 4 for the 2870s, as on some IBM models. For smaller IBM computers, System/360 Models 50 and below, and System/370 Models 158 and below, channels were implemented in the CPU's microcode, and the CPU itself operated in one of two modes, either \\"CPU Mode\\" or \\"Channel Mode\\", with the channel mode 'blocking' the CPU mode (IBM 2860, 2870 and 2880, and Amdahl channels were 'non-blocking'). Much later, the channels were implemented as an on-board processor residing in the same box as the CPU, generally referred to as a \\"channel processor\\", and which was usually a RISC processor, but which could be a System/390 microprocessor with special microcode as in IBM's CMOS mainframes. One of the earliest non-IBM channel systems was hosted in the CDC 6600 supercomputer in 1965. The CDC utilized 10 logically independent computers called peripheral processors, or PPs for this role. PPS was powerful, a modern version of CDC's first 'personal computer', the CDC 160A. The operating system resided and executed in the primary processor, PP0. Since then, channel controllers have been a standard part of most mainframe designs and primary advantage mainframes have over smaller, faster, personal computers and network computing. Channel controllers have also been made as small as single-chip designs with multiple channels on them, used in the NeXT computers for instance. However, with the rapid speed increases in computers today, combined with operating systems that don't 'block' when waiting for data, channel controllers have become correspondingly less effective and are not commonly found on small machines. Channel controllers are making a comeback in the form of bus mastering peripheral devices, such as PCI direct memory access (DMA) devices. The rationale for these devices is the same as for the original channel controllers, namely off- loading transfer, interrupts, and context switching from the main CPU.  Description  The reference implementation of channel I/O is that of the IBM System/360 family of mainframes and its successors, but similar implementations have been adopted by other mainframe vendors, such as Control Data, Bull (General Electric/Honeywell) and Unisys. Computer systems that use channel I/O have special hardware components that handle all input/output operations in their entirety independently of the systems' CPU(s). The CPU of a system that uses channel I/O typically has only one machine instruction in its repertoire for input and output; this instruction is used to pass input/output commands to the specialized I/O hardware in the form of channel programs. I/O thereafter proceeds without intervention from the CPU until an event requiring notification of the operating system occurs, at which point the I/O hardware signals an interrupt to the CPU. A channel is an independent hardware component that coordinates all I/O to a set of controllers or devices. It is not merely a medium of communication, despite the name; it is a programmable device that handles all details of I/O after being given a list of I/O operations to carry out (the channel program). Each channel may support one or more controllers and/or devices, but each channel program may only be directed at one of those connected devices. A channel program contains lists of commands to the channel itself and to the controller and device to which it is directed. Once the operating system has prepared a complete list of channel commands, it executes a single I/O machine instruction to initiate the channel program; the channel thereafter assumes control of the I/O operations until they are completed. It is possible to develop very complex channel programs, including testing of data and conditional branching within that channel program. This flexibility frees the CPU from the overhead of starting, monitoring, and managing individual I/O operations. The specialized channel hardware, in turn, is dedicated to I/O and can carry it out more efficiently than the CPU (and entirely in parallel with the CPU). Channel I/O is not unlike the Direct Memory Access (DMA) of microcomputers, only more complex and advanced. On large mainframe computer systems, CPUs are only one of several powerful hardware components that work in parallel. Special input/output controllers (the exact names of which vary from one manufacturer to another) handle I/O exclusively, and these, in turn, are connected to hardware channels that also are dedicated to input and output. There may be several CPUs and several I/O processors. The overall architecture optimizes input/output performance without degrading pure CPU performance. Since most real-world applications of mainframe systems are heavily I/O-intensive business applications, this architecture helps provide the very high levels of throughput that distinguish mainframes from other types of computers. In IBM ESA/390 terminology, a channel is a parallel data connection inside the tree- like or hierarchically organized I/O subsystem. In System/390 I/O cages, channels either directly connect to devices which are installed inside the cage (communication adapter such as ESCON, FICON, Open Systems Adapter) or they run outside of the cage, below the raised floor as cables of the thickness of a thumb and directly connect to channel interfaces on bigger devices like tape subsystems, direct access storage devices (DASDs), terminal concentrators and other ESA/390 systems. Types of channels Channels differ in the number and type of concurrent I/O operations they support. In IBM terminology, a multiplexer channel supports a number of concurrent interleaved slow-speed operations, each transferring one byte from a device at a time. A selector channel supports one high-speed operation, transferring a block of data at a time. A block multiplexer supports a number of logically concurrent channel programs, but only one high-speed data transfer at a time.  Channel program  A channel program is a sequence of channel command words (CCWs) that are executed by the I/O channel subsystem in the IBM System/360 and subsequent architectures. A channel program consists of one or more channel command words. The operating system signals the I/O channel subsystem to begin executing the channel program with an SSCH (start sub-channel) instruction. The central processor is then free to proceed with non-I/O instructions until interrupted. When the channel operations are complete, the channel interrupts the central processor with an I/O interruption. In earlier models of the IBM mainframe line, the channel unit was an identifiable component, one for each channel. In modern mainframes, the channels are implemented using an independent RISC processor, the channel processor, one for all channels. IBM System/370 Extended ArchitectureIBM System/370 Extended Architecture Principles of Operation, SA22-7085-0 and its successors replaced the earlier SIO (start I/O) and SIOF (start I/O fast release) machine instructions (System/360 and early System/370) with the SSCH (start sub-channel) instruction (ESA/370 and successors). Channel I/O provides considerable economies in input/output. For example, on IBM's Linux on IBM Z, the formatting of an entire track of a DASD requires only one channel program (and thus only one I/O instruction), but multiple channel command words (one per block). The program is executed by the dedicated I/O processor, while the application processor (the CPU) is free for other work. = Channel command words = A channel command word (CCW) is an instruction to a specialized I/O channel processor which is, in fact, a finite state machine. It is used to initiate an I/O operation, such as \\"read\\", \\"write\\" or \\"sense\\", on a channel- attached device. On system architectures that implement channel I/O, typically all devices are connected by channels, and so all I/O requires the use of CCWs. CCWs are organized into channel programs by the operating system, and I/O subroutine, a utility program, or by standalone software (such as test and diagnostic programs). A limited \\"branching\\" capability, hence a dynamically programmable capability, is available within such channel programs, by use of the \\"status modifier\\" channel flag and the \\"transfer-in-channel\\" CCW. = Chaining = IBM CCWs are chained to form the channel program. Bits in the CCW indicates that the following location in storage contains a CCW that is part of the same channel program. The channel program normally executes sequential CCWs until an exception occurs, a Transfer-in-Channel (TIC) CCW is executed, or a CCW is executed without chaining indicated. Command chaining tells the channel that the next CCW contains a new command. Data chaining indicates that the next CCW contains the address of additional data for the same command, allowing, for example, portions of one record to be written from or read to multiple data areas in storage (gather-writing and scatter-reading). = Self- modifying channel programs = Channel programs can modify their own operation during execution based on data read. For example, self modification is used extensively in OS/360 ISAM. = Channel program example = The following example reads a disk record identified by a recorded key. The track containing the record and the desired value of the key is known. The device control unit will search the track to find the requested record. In this example <> indicate that the channel program contains the storage address of the specified field. SEEK SEARCH KEY EQUAL TIC *-8 Back to search if not equal READ DATA The TIC (transfer in the channel) will cause the channel program to branch to the SEARCH command until a record with a matching key (or the end of the track) is encountered. When a record with a matching key is found the DASD controller will include Status Modifier in the channel status, causing the channel to skip the TIC CCW; thus the channel program will not branch and the channel will execute the READ command. The above example is correct for unblocked records (one record per block). For blocked records (more than one record per block), the recorded key must be the same as the highest key within that block (and the records must be in key sequence), and the following channel program would be utilized: SEEK SEARCH KEY HIGH OR EQUAL TIC *-8 Back to search if not high or equal READ DATA If the dataset is allocated in tracks, and the end of the track is reached without the requested record being found the channel program terminates and returns a \\"no record found\\" status indication. Similarly, if the dataset is allocated in cylinders, and the end of the cylinder is reached without the requested record being found the channel program terminates and returns a \\"no record found\\" status indication. In some cases, the system software has the option of updating the track or cylinder number and redriving the I/O operation without interrupting the application program.  Channel programs in virtual storage systems  On most systems channels operate using real (or physical) addresses, while the channel programs are built using virtual addresses. The operating system is responsible for translating these channel programs before executing them, and for this particular purpose the Input/Output Supervisor (IOS) has a special \\"fast fix\\" function which was designed into the OS Supervisor just for those \\"fixes\\" which are of relatively short duration (i.e., significantly shorter than \\"wall-clock time\\"). Pages containing data to be used by the I/O operation are locked into real memory, or page fixed. The channel program is copied and all virtual addresses are replaced by real addresses before the I/O operation is started. After the operation completes, the pages are unfixed. As page fixing and unfixing is a CPU-expensive process long-term page fixing is sometimes used to reduce the CPU cost. Here the virtual memory is page-fixed for the life of the application, rather than fixing and freeing around each I/O operation. An example of a program that can use long-term page fixing is DB2. An alternative to long-term page fixing is moving the entire application, including all its data buffers, to a preferred area of main storage. This is accomplished by a special SYSEVENT in MVS/370 through z/OS operating systems, wherein the application is, first, swapped-out from wherever it may be, presumably from a non-preferred area, to swap and page external storage, and is, second, swapped-in to a preferred area (SYSEVENT TRANSWAP). Thereafter, the application may be marked non-swappable by another special SYSEVENT (SYSEVENT DONTSWAP). Whenever such an application terminates, whether normally or abnormally, the operating system implicitly issues yet another special SYSEVENT on the application's behalf if it has not already done so (SYSEVENT OKSWAP).  Booting with channel I/O  Even bootstrapping of the system, or Initial Program Load (IPL) in IBM nomenclature, is carried out by channels, although the process is partially simulated by the CPU (through an implied Start I/O (SIO) instruction, an implied Channel Address Word (CAW) at location 0 and an implied channel command word (CCW) with an opcode of Read IPL, also at location 0. Command chaining is assumed, so the implied CCW at location 0 falls through to the continuation of the channel program at locations 8 and 16, and possibly elsewhere should one of those CCWs be a transfer-in-channel (TIC).See System/370 Principles of Operation, GA22–7000–4, pp 54—55, Initial Program Loading; System/370 Extended Architecture is quite similar, although XA utilizes an \\"implied\\" Start Subchannel (SSCH) instead of an \\"implied\\" Start I/O. To load a system, the implied Read IPL CCW reads the first block of the selected IPL device into the 24-byte data area at location 0, the channel continues with the second and third double words, which are CCWs, and this channel program loads the first portion of the system loading software elsewhere in main storage. The first double word contains a PSW which, when fetched at the conclusion of the IPL, causes the CPU to execute the IPL Text (bootstrap loader) read in by the CCW at location 8. The IPL Text then locates, loads and transfers control to the operating system's Nucleus. The Nucleus performs or initiates any necessary initialization and then commences normal OS operations. This IPL concept is device-independent. It is capable of IPL-ing from a card deck, from a magnetic tape, or from a direct access storage device, (DASD), e.g., disk, drum. The Read IPL (X'02') command, which is simulated by the CPU, is a Read EBCDIC Select Stacker 1 read command on the card reader and a Read command on tape media (which are inherently sequential access in nature), but a special Read-IPL command on DASD. DASD controllers accept the X'02' command, seek to cylinder X'0000' head X'0000', skip to the index point (i.e., just past the track descriptor record (R0)) and then treat the Read IPL command as if it were a Read Data (X'06') command. Without this special DASD controller behavior, device-independent IPL would not be possible. On a DASD, the IPL Text is contained on cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and record X'01' (24 bytes), and cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and record X'02' (fairly large, certainly somewhat more than 3,000 bytes). The volume label is always contained on cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and block X'03' (80 bytes). The volume label always points to the VTOC, with a pointer of the form HHHH (that is, the VTOC must reside within the first 65,536 tracks). The VTOC's Format 4 DSCB defines the extent (size) of the VTOC, so the volume label only needs a pointer to the first track in the VTOC's extent, and as the Format 4 DSCB, which describes the VTOC, is always the very first DSCB in the VTOC, HHHH also points to the Format 4 DSCB. If an attempt is made to IPL from a device that was not initialized with IPL Text, the system simply enters a wait state. The DASD (direct access storage device) initialization program, IBCDASDI, or the DASD initialization application, ICKDSF, places a wait state PSW and a dummy CCW string in the 24 bytes, should the device be designated for data only, not for IPL, after which these programs format the VTOC and perform other hard drive initialization functions.

He is considered to be one of the most significant Zen priests of his time for bringing Zen practice into the lives of laypeople and popularizing the ancient tradition of sewing the kesa. Peter Sloterdijk has called him \\"one of the most striking Zen masters of recent times.\\" Biography Sawaki was born in Tsu, Mie on June 16, 1880. He was the sixth child and both his parents died when he was young, his mother when he was four and his father three years later. Sawaki was then adopted by an aunt whose husband soon died. After this, Sawaki was raised by a gambler and lantern maker named Bunkichi Sawaki. When he was 16, he ran away from home to become a monk at Eihei-ji, one of the two head temples of the Sōtō Zen sect, and later traveled to Soshin-ji where he was ordained in 1899 by Koho Sawada. However, he was drafted to serve in the Imperial Japanese Army during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 to minister to the wounded. After being discharged in 1906, Sawaki became head student at Soshin-ji. He received dharma transmission later that year from Zenko Sawada. He then studied for two years at the priests training school of Senju-ji, a Jōdo Shinshū temple in the Takada district of Tsu. From there, Sawaki traveled to Hōryū-ji to study Yogacara with Join Saeki. At this point, Sawaki began studying Dogen and practicing zazen. Sawaki spent a three-month practice period studying Dogen with Oka Sotan. He later became a Zen teacher, and during the 1930s he served as a professor at Komazawa University. In 1949, he took responsibility for Antai-ji, a zen temple in northern Kyoto. Because of his regular travels throughout Japan to teach zen, and against tradition his not becoming a conventional abbot of a home temple, he came to be known as \\"Homeless Kodo\\" (\\"homeless\\" in the Japanese referring more to his lack of a temple than a residence). Sawaki died on December 21, 1965, at Antaiji. He was succeeded by a senior disciple, Kosho Uchiyama. He is known for his rigorous emphasis on zazen, in particular the practice of shikantaza, or \\"just sitting\\". He often called Zen \\"wonderfully useless,\\" discouraging any gaining idea or seeking after special experiences or states of consciousness. Lineage Calligraphy by Kōdō Sawaki. 海底泥牛吼 (Clay ox howls on the floor of the sea) =Dharma transmission to= Though Sawaki ordained many monks and nuns, only five monks and three nuns received Dharma Transmission (Shihō) from Sawaki: * Shūyū Narita (1914-2004): students in Japan and Europe. * Kosho Uchiyama (1912-1998): succeeded Sawaki as abbot of Antai-ji. * Sodō Yokoyama (1907-1980): also called \\"Kusabue Zenji (Zen master of the grass-flute)\\". * Satō Myōshin. * Kōjun KishigamiSangha Sans Demeure, Kojun Kishigami Osho (born 1941): lives in Japan; students in Japan, France and Germany. * Jōshin Kasai (1920-1985): female, active in kesa sewing. * Kōbun Okamoto (1925-?): female, active in kesa sewing. * Baikō Fukuda: female, part time tenzô (cook) in Antaiji. =Influential students= Other influential students of Sawaki who did not receive Dharma transmission from him are: * Gudo Wafu Nishijima (1919-2014) * Taisen DeshimaruSangha Sans Demeure (1914-1982): went to France in 1967 and lived there for the rest of his life, establishing the Association Zen Internationale.

It was first published by the Soviet mathematician Semyon Aronovich Gershgorin in 1931. Gershgorin's name has been transliterated in several different ways, including Geršgorin, Gerschgorin, Gershgorin, Hershhorn, and Hirschhorn. Statement and proof Let A be a complex n\\\\times n matrix, with entries a_{ij}. For i \\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\} let R_i = \\\\sum_{j eq{i}} \\\\lefta_{ij}\\\\right be the sum of the absolute values of the non-diagonal entries in the i-th row. Let D(a_{ii}, R_i ) \\\\subseteq \\\\Complex be a closed disc centered at a_{ii} with radius R_i. Such a disc is called a Gershgorin disc. Theorem: Every eigenvalue of A lies within at least one of the Gershgorin discs D(a_{ii},R_i). Proof: Let \\\\lambda be an eigenvalue of A. Choose a corresponding eigenvector x = (x_j) so that one component x_i is equal to 1 and the others are of absolute value less than or equal to 1: x_i = 1 and x_j\\\\le 1 for j e i. There is always such an x, which can be obtained simply by dividing any eigenvector by its component with largest modulus. Since Ax=\\\\lambda x, in particular : \\\\sum_j a_{ij} x_j = \\\\lambda x_i = \\\\lambda. So, splitting the sum and taking into account once again that x_i = 1, we get : \\\\sum_{j e i} a_{ij} x_j + a_{ii}= \\\\lambda. Therefore, applying the triangle inequality, : \\\\lambda - a_{ii} = \\\\left\\\\sum_{j e i} a_{ij} x_j\\\\right \\\\le \\\\sum_{j e i} a_{ij} x_j \\\\le \\\\sum_{j e i} a_{ij} = R_i. Corollary: The eigenvalues of A must also lie within the Gershgorin discs Cj corresponding to the columns of A. Proof: Apply the Theorem to AT. Example For a diagonal matrix, the Gershgorin discs coincide with the spectrum. Conversely, if the Gershgorin discs coincide with the spectrum, the matrix is diagonal. Discussion One way to interpret this theorem is that if the off-diagonal entries of a square matrix over the complex numbers have small norms, the eigenvalues of the matrix cannot be \\"far from\\" the diagonal entries of the matrix. Therefore, by reducing the norms of off-diagonal entries one can attempt to approximate the eigenvalues of the matrix. Of course, diagonal entries may change in the process of minimizing off-diagonal entries. The theorem does not claim that there is one disc for each eigenvalue; if anything, the discs rather correspond to the axes in \\\\mathbb{C}^n, and each expresses a bound on precisely those eigenvalues whose eigenspaces are closest to one particular axis. In the matrix : \\\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 & 2  1 & 1 & 0  1 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 & 0  0 & b & 0  0 & 0 & c \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 & 2  1 & 1 & 0  1 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -3a+2b+2c & 6a-2b-4c & 6a-4b-2c  b-a & a+(a-b) & 2(a-b)  c-a & 2(a-c) & a+(a-c) \\\\end{pmatrix} — which by construction has eigenvalues a, b, and c with eigenvectors \\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 3  1  1 \\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right) , \\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 2  1  0 \\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right) , and \\\\left(\\\\begin{smallmatrix} 2  0  1 \\\\end{smallmatrix}\\\\right) — it is easy to see that the disc for row 2 covers a and b while the disc for row 3 covers a and c. This is however just a happy coincidence; if working through the steps of the proof one finds that it in each eigenvector is the first element that is the largest (every eigenspace is closer to the first axis than to any other axis), so the theorem only promises that the disc for row 1 (whose radius can be twice the sum of the other two radii) covers all three eigenvalues. Strengthening of the theorem If one of the discs is disjoint from the others then it contains exactly one eigenvalue. If however it meets another disc it is possible that it contains no eigenvalue (for example, A=\\\\begin{pmatrix}0&14&0\\\\end{pmatrix} or A=\\\\begin{pmatrix}1&-21&-1\\\\end{pmatrix} ). In the general case the theorem can be strengthened as follows: Theorem: If the union of k discs is disjoint from the union of the other n − k discs then the former union contains exactly k and the latter n − k eigenvalues of A. Proof: Let D be the diagonal matrix with entries equal to the diagonal entries of A and let : B(t)=(1-t)D + tA. We will use the fact that the eigenvalues are continuous in t, and show that if any eigenvalue moves from one of the unions to the other, then it must be outside all the discs for some t, which is a contradiction. The statement is true for D = B(0). The diagonal entries of B(t) are equal to that of A, thus the centers of the Gershgorin circles are the same, however their radii are t times that of A. Therefore, the union of the corresponding k discs of B(t) is disjoint from the union of the remaining n-k for all t \\\\in [0,1]. The discs are closed, so the distance of the two unions for A is d>0. The distance for B(t) is a decreasing function of t, so it is always at least d. Since the eigenvalues of B(t) are a continuous function of t, for any eigenvalue \\\\lambda(t) of B(t) in the union of the k discs its distance d(t) from the union of the other n-k discs is also continuous. Obviously d(0)\\\\ge d, and assume \\\\lambda(1) lies in the union of the n-k discs. Then d(1)=0, so there exists 0 such that 0. But this means \\\\lambda(t_0) lies outside the Gershgorin discs, which is impossible. Therefore \\\\lambda(1) lies in the union of the k discs, and the theorem is proven. Remarks: * The continuity of \\\\lambda(t) should be understand in the sense of topology. It is sufficient to show that the roots (as a point in space \\\\mathbb{C}^n) is continuous function of its coefficients. Note that the inverse map that maps roots to coefficients is described by Vieta's formulas (note for Characteristic polynomial a_n\\\\equiv1) which can be proved an open map. This proves the roots as a whole is a continuous function of its coefficients. Since composition of continuous functions is again continuous, the \\\\lambda(t) as a composition of roots solver and B(t) is also continuous. * Individual eigenvalue \\\\lambda(t) could merge with other eigenvalue(s) or appeared from a splitting of previous eigenvalue. This may confuse people and questioning the concept of continuous. However, when viewing from the space of eigenvalue set \\\\mathbb{C}^n, the trajectory is still a continuous curve although not necessarily smooth everywhere. Added Remark: * The proof given above is arguably (in)correct...... There are two types of continuity concerning eigenvalues: (1) each individual eigenvalue is a usual continuous function (such a representation does exist on a real interval but may not exist on a complex domain), (2) eigenvalues are continuous as a whole in the topological sense (a mapping from the matrix space with metric induced by a norm to unordered tuples, i.e., the quotient space of C^n under permutation equivalence with induced metric). Whichever continuity is used in a proof of the Gerschgorin disk theorem, it should be justified that the sum of algebraic multiplicities of eigenvalues remains unchanged on each connected region. A proof using the argument principle of complex analysis requires no eigenvalue continuity of any kind. Roger A. Horn & Charles R. Johnson (2013), Matrix Analysis, second edition, Cambridge University Press For a brief discussion and clarification, see Chi-Kwong Li & Fuzhen Zhang (2019), Eigenvalue continuity and Gersgorin's theorem, Electronic Journal of Linear Algebra (ELA) {Vol.35, pp.619-6252019} [DOI: https://doi.org/10.13001/ela.2019.5179. Application The Gershgorin circle theorem is useful in solving matrix equations of the form Ax = b for x where b is a vector and A is a matrix with a large condition number. In this kind of problem, the error in the final result is usually of the same order of magnitude as the error in the initial data multiplied by the condition number of A. For instance, if b is known to six decimal places and the condition number of A is 1000 then we can only be confident that x is accurate to three decimal places. For very high condition numbers, even very small errors due to rounding can be magnified to such an extent that the result is meaningless. It would be good to reduce the condition number of A. This can be done by preconditioning: A matrix P such that P ≈ A−1 is constructed, and then the equation PAx = Pb is solved for x. Using the exact inverse of A would be nice but finding the inverse of a matrix is something we want to avoid because of the computational expense. Now, since PA ≈ I where I is the identity matrix, the eigenvalues of PA should all be close to 1. By the Gershgorin circle theorem, every eigenvalue of PA lies within a known area and so we can form a rough estimate of how good our choice of P was.  Example  Use the Gershgorin circle theorem to estimate the eigenvalues of: thumb400pxrightThis diagram shows the discs in yellow derived for the eigenvalues. The first two disks overlap and their union contains two eigenvalues. The third and fourth disks are disjoint from the others and contain one eigenvalue each. : A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 10 & -1 & 0 & 1 0.2 & 8 & 0.2 & 0.2 1 & 1 & 2 & 1 -1 & -1 & -1 & -11 \\\\end{bmatrix}. Starting with row one, we take the element on the diagonal, aii as the center for the disc. We then take the remaining elements in the row and apply the formula: : \\\\sum_{j e i} a_{ij} = R_i to obtain the following four discs: : D(10,2), \\\\; D(8,0.6), \\\\; D(2,3), \\\\; \\\\text{and} \\\\; D(-11,3). Note that we can improve the accuracy of the last two discs by applying the formula to the corresponding columns of the matrix, obtaining D(2,1.2) and D(-11,2.2) . The eigenvalues are 9.8218, 8.1478, 1.8995, -10.86. Note that this is a (column) diagonally dominant matrix: a_{ii} > \\\\sum_{j eq i} a_{ji}. This means that most of the matrix is in the diagonal, which explains why the eigenvalues are so close to the centers of the circles, and the estimates are very good. For a random matrix, we would expect the eigenvalues to be substantially further from the centers of the circles.

It is one of the nearest stars to the Sun at about 12.9 light- years' distance, and the brightest M dwarf star in Earth's night sky, although it is generally too faint to be seen without a telescope. At an apparent magnitude of +6.7, it may only be visible to the unaided eye under exceptionally good viewing conditions, under dark skies. It was originally listed in a 1763 catalog that was published posthumously by the French Abbé Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. He observed it in the southern sky while working from an observatory at the Cape of Good Hope. In the past Lacaille 8760 has been classified anywhere from spectral class K7 down to M2. In 1979 the Irish astronomer Patrick Byrne discovered that it is a flare star, and it was given the variable star designation AX Microscopii. As a flare star it is relatively quiet, only erupting on average less than once per day. Lacaille 8760 orbits around the galaxy with a relatively high ellipticity of 0.23. Its closest approach to the Sun occurred about 20,000 years ago when it came within . Due to its low mass (60% of the Sun), it has an expected lifespan of about 75 billion (, seven times longer than the Sun's. Despite efforts by astronomers, as of 2011 no planets had been detected in orbit around this star. Lacaille 8760 is one of the largest and brightest red dwarfs known, with about 60% the mass and 51% the radius of the Sun.

Early life Hughes moved to Mold after his mother married John Hughes, a bricklayer at the John Summers steelworks in Shotton. Hughes first attended Mold Council School, and then in 1937 Alun School. After finishing at the age of 15 he worked for a shoe store in Mold. He was promoted to branch manager in Bangor, but was suddenly dismissed for, as he later claimed, dressing the shop windows while in his shirt sleeves. Wartime service Hughes joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in 1941 and was selected for flying duties as an air gunner. He was posted to No. 467 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force, and within five months made such a favourable impression that he was recommended for an officer's commission. On 17 August 1943, Hughes was flying his 21st mission as a gunner in a Lancaster bomber, which was participating on a raid on Peenemünde. The crew bailed out after the aircraft was attacked and set on fire by an enemy fighter, and Hughes was captured and sent to a Dulag Luft (a transit camp and interrogation centre for captured aircrew) near Frankfurt. Collaboration Hughes initially agreed to hand out what he had been told were Red Cross forms to his fellow prisoners, believing that the data was to be used to help contact the POWs' families. They were in fact forms designed to elicit more personal data than the \\"name, rank and serial number\\" which was all that PoWs (Prisoners of War) were required to reveal, which would later be used in interrogations. Hughes soon became useful to the Germans and remained at the Dulag Luft instead of being moved on to a standard PoW camp. His assistance was rewarded by better accommodation and more privileges than other prisoners, including being allowed to wear civilian clothes, and it was even reported that by November 1943 he was wearing a German uniform. Using the alias of John Charles Baker, Hughes agreed to broadcast propaganda and went to Berlin where he was allowed a substantial degree of freedom, renting a flat while he was employed as a broadcaster and scriptwriter at Radio Metropole, for which he was paid 600 RM monthly. Between January and March 1944 he made several broadcasts in the Welsh language directed at Welsh troops fighting in the Italian campaign. Evidence gathered by MI9, which maintained secret links with Allied PoWs, later suggested that Hughes had also been writing anti-Jewish propaganda for broadcast. Sometime in 1944 Hughes was stripped of his privileges and confined to a POW camp, where he was eventually liberated by the advancing Soviet forces in April 1945. While awaiting transport to Britain he was arrested and charged with voluntarily aiding the enemy while a POW. Court-martial Hughes appeared before a court-martial held at RAF Uxbridge in August 1945, where he pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of assisting the enemy, including a charge of giving money to British Free Corps recruiters, an SS unit composed of British and Allied POWs. He was cleared of six of the charges but found guilty of the remaining five, three of which carried a potential death sentence. However, he was eventually sentenced to five years' hard labour, which was subsequently reduced to two years following an appeal for clemency. He died in Cheltenham, having become a businessman. Popular culture Hughes' story was retold in the play Radio Cymru written by Wiliam Owen Roberts, which was produced by the Dalier Sylw theatre company.

History  Former kiln of Rockingham Pottery The town was once a centre for the manufacture of pottery of international importance, and deep coal mining, glassmaking, canal barge- building and engineering. It is known for the Rockingham Pottery, a world- renowned manufacturer of porcelain. Although the factory closed in 1842, its name defines a style of rococo porcelain. There were several other potteries in the area during the 19th century. One of the original kilns, a small part of the factory, a gatehouse (both now private residences) and the pottery flint millpond remain today in Pottery Ponds, a small park off Blackamoor Road near the Woodman public house. Swinton was also the site of the important but lesser known Don Pottery. The village lies between the Roman Ridge (extending approximately from Wincobank to the north east of Sheffield, to Mexborough) and the south west Roman road from Doncaster (the Roman fort and minor settlement of Danum). A coin hoard dating to the early 3rd century was excavated during the construction of a house cellar in the village in 1853. In June 2014, Andrew Allen uncovered a number of pottery sherds whilst gardening at home. Preliminary observations found that it comprised approximately 90 pottery sherds, including high status Samian ware, traditional cooking wares and rusticated pottery, as well as possible metal and glass working waste products. In October 2014, South Yorkshire's first crowd-funded archaeological project commenced with an archaeological excavation in the area of the pottery finds. It found evidence of a Roman ditch and a possible Roman field system and numerous pieces of pottery from the late 1st to mid 3rd centuries. Further archaeological excavation was undertaken in spring 2015 and a comprehensive geophysical survey of Swinton Fitzwilliam school playing fields. Further work is planned with Elmet Archaeology and the local community.  Topography  St Margaret's Church (Church of England) The town is situated on a hillside. The higher areas generally contain older dwellings, and the lower, newer build properties. The lowest part of the town contains two main rail lines, the River Don, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation canal and the derelict Dearne and Dove Canal.  Economy and transport  Following the decline of traditional industries and after the 1980s miners' strike), employment is provided predominantly by service and light industry in the Manvers area. Surviving in the area of railway lines and canals is a boat yard with a limited barge repair and transport business, and timber milling and woodworking facilities. The Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation canal, once a major transport route between Sheffield and Goole, underwent substantial modernisation in the mid-1980s and is capable of accommodating large vessels as far as Rotherham, and pleasure craft through to Sheffield. Limited bulk freight has returned to the canal with use of the modern Swinton Lock. The town was without a railway station between January 1968, when the old station was closed as part of the Beeching cuts, and 1991, when a new station was opened after the restoration of the double track \\"Swinton Curve\\" (also known as the \\"Foundry Curve\\"), enabling trains to travel from Sheffield to Doncaster. Increased passenger usage led to the provision of a portable building staffed for morning peak times only. It was replaced by a brick building housing a ticket office and waiting room. Some local bus services connect with trains at this facility. Most manufacturing has ceased, but substantial warehousing remains. Morphy Richards & Roberts Radio brands run a large site. An American bagel company and centres for Stelrad and Jackson's building supplies and Tachart Ltd t/a Bolt and Nut Manufacturing operate in the town. Swinton's working class traditions gave way during the mid-1980s manufacturing upheaval, and the town now has marked divisions between deprived areas and newer middle class areas.  Education  Swinton's secondary school, with sixth form college, is Swinton Academy. It teaches pupils from age 11 to 18. The school was scheduled to be rebuilt on the current site but the scrapping of the rebuilding schools programme by the coalition government of the time meant that the school will not have a new building. There are also several primary schools and nurseries, including Swinton Fitzwilliam Primary, Swinton Queen Primary School and Brookfield Primary School. Swinton Queen Primary School was rebuilt and opened in March 2011 with the old school buildings being demolished. On the outskirts of Swinton are Dearne Valley College and the empty Humphry Davy House which was used for nursing studies by Sheffield University.  Amenities  Swinton has 14 public houses commonly called \\"The Swinton Mile\\", which range from typical Yorkshire pubs serving food, modern bars, and a working men's club.  Local issues  Industrial premises on Swinton's boundary with Kilnhurst were occupied by Croda Hydrocarbons, who took over the works from Midland and Yorkshire Tar Distillers. The site is controversial owing to pollution during the plant operations. Despite this planning permission was granted to build domestic dwellings. A Validation Certificate has been issued and work by Gleeson Homes started.\\"Cash set aside for homes bid\\", South Yorkshire Times, 6 December 2012.

The main campus is located on the grounds of Southern Arkansas University Tech in Camden, Arkansas, alongside the Arkansas Law Enforcement Training Academy. Mission The mission of the Arkansas Fire Training Academy is to provide training and certification in fire fighting and related emergency service programs to the Arkansas Fire Service, in accordance with the standards of the National Fire Protection Association. The degree program results in an associates of science degree in Fire and Emergency Response. History Fire training in Arkansas began in 1939 through the Arkansas Fire College in an office in the Old Main Building at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville campus. The first official training publication of the Fire College, titled \\"Arkansas Fireman\\", was issued May 15, 1939. The Arkansas Fire College and its monthly training publication were transferred from the University of Arkansas to the Arkansas Fire Prevention Bureau in Little Rock on September 1, 1942. The Arkansas Fire Prevention Bureau was supported by the Arkansas Inspection and Rating Bureau, later to be known as the Insurance Service Office (ISO). From the time of inception in 1939 to the final publication in on December 1, 1969, the monthly publication was written by Carl S. Smalley, the first state fire instructor. From the beginning in 1939, the fire training was through the Arkansas Fire College. Because there was no physical base from which to work, instructors traveled throughout Arkansas teaching firefighting techniques to individual fire department personnel and through regional fire schools attended by fire departments in central, eastern, and northwestern geographical areas. The regional fire schools became the method that statewide fire training was delivered, and the first regional school was held in Fort Smith on June 19-22, 1939. Approximately 80 firefighters from 8 cities and towns attended with instruction provided by Fort Smith Fire Department Assistant Chiefs John Dixon and Pink Dean and Captains Furner, Williamson, and Borger. Instruction for local fire department training officers was also developed to ensure the continued training of fire fighters, supplemented by the regional training programs. The Fire Training Academy (as it was originally named) was formally established in 1967 as a training division of the Southwest Technical Institute (later to become Southern Arkansas University Technical Campus). The administrative offices for the new fire academy were set up in what was once the main fire station of the weapons depot. This building served as the AFTA administrative offices, primary classroom and central training location until Phase I construction at the Camden training site was completed in 1973. The building continued to serve as the administration building until the completion of a new administrative building at the training site in June 2004. In 1980, the Fire Academy helped coordinate the delivery of extensive training programs offered by the National Fire Prevention and Control Administration (later known as the US Fire Administration) to help curb the unusually high fire death and injury rates in the state. Under a massive agreement, signed by Governor Bill Clinton and US Fire Administrator Gordon Vickery, national fire training materials from the National Fire Academy and initiatives from the Fire Administration's Public Education Office were delivered to the Arkansas Fire Academy for dissemination to local fire departments. The Lead Instructor of the Arkansas Fire Training Academy was Whit Murphy, for whom the facilities at the Camden Training Site are named. The Camden Training Site includes the new administration building with theatre style classroom, faculty and staff offices and reception area and a large classroom building with offices, a large two-story burn building, a small single-story, a smoke building, a five- story drill tower, an apparatus building, pumpers, and various training props. 2009 Tornado The Academy's main campus in East Camden, Arkansas, was struck by a tornado on October 29, 2009, at approximately 3:50 pm. There were approximately 43 students, and several faculty in the classroom and administration buildings when the storm hit the academy grounds. The tornado, rated EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, destroyed multiple buildings, including the main engine bay and smokehouse, and severely damaged all other facilities, with the exception of the Nix building, the main burn building, and the training tower. Most vehicles were damaged, some being thrown around the grounds, and consequently totaled. Academy locations The Academy's main campus is located at Southern Arkansas University Tech in Camden. The Academy also operates campuses at Conway, Jonesboro, Lincoln, and Marshall (the Marshall Campus is closed as of September 2005), as well as Associate Training Centers at Black River Technical College in Pocahontas and at Cossatot Community College in DeQueen. Firefighter training The Arkansas Fire Training Academy is accredited by the International Fire Service Accreditation Congress (IFSAC) and the National Board on Fire Service Professional Qualifications (NPQS or Pro-Board) to certify personnel to the Firefighter I, Firefighter II, Driver/Operator, Hazardous Materials-Awareness, Hazardous Materials-Operations, Instructor I and Fire Officer I & II levels. As of 2018, The Arkansas Fire Training Academy offers its services to all Fire Departments in Arkansas, free of charge, regardless if public or private, paid or volunteer. The Academy conducts six \\"Firefighter Standards\\" classes a year. Upon completion of each \\"Standards\\" class, firefighters are certified in both IFSAC and ProBoard as Firefighter I and II. The Academy offers a wide range of classes both on and off campus through a network of adjunct instructors. EMS training The Arkansas Fire Training Academy offers medical training at the BLS-level. The Academy offers certification for both Emergency Medical Responder and Emergency Medical Technician. The Arkansas Department of Health does not recognize any medical provider below the level of Emergency Medical Technician, instead allowing cities and counties to regulate medical first responders. The Arkansas Fire Academy offers six classes each year of \\"EMS First Responder,\\" which follows the 2011 NREMT model for Emergency Medical Responder. Because the State does not regulate this level of medical responders, the Fire Academy course has become a widely accepted standard in many areas of the state. The Arkansas EMT Association recognizes first responders certified in compliance with the Arkansas Fire Training Academy as medical providers, and has opened membership to those trained under the Arkansas Fire Academy program.

He was a candidate in the 2006 race for Governor of Iowa but lost in the primary to Chet Culver. Political career Blouin was born on a Naval Air Base in Jacksonville, Florida, and attended school in Miami Shores, Florida, and Chicago, Illinois. In 1966 he received a B.A. in political science from Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa. He remained in Dubuque to teach elementary school. Two years later, he won a seat in the Iowa House of Representatives, where he served from 1969 to 1973. Blouin then won election to the Iowa Senate, serving from 1973 to 1974. In 1974 Blouin ran for the U.S. House seat in the Second District being vacated by fellow Democrat John C. Culver, who was running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Harold Hughes. Blouin defeated Republican Tom Riley, an attorney from Cedar Rapids, in the general election. Blouin became one of many freshman Democrats in the largest Democratic majority in the House since 1965-67, providing a mathematical two-thirds majority in that chamber.\\"Democrats: Now the Morning After\\", Time Magazine, 1974-11-18. For the only time since 1857, Iowa's congressional delegation included only one Republican. Blouin won re-election in 1976, defeating Riley in a closer rematch. Besides shifting control of the White House to the Democrats, the 1976 elections expanded the Democratic majority in the House by one seat. It was the last time the Democrats would hold a two-thirds majority. Blouin was defeated by Tom Tauke in 1978, as part of a mid-term election that was the first phase of a conservative backlash, particularly in the Midwest.\\"A Toss-'Em-Out Temper\\", Time Magazine, 1978-11-20. He was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to be the first Director of the newly formed Information Security Oversight Office; he served from 1978 to 1980. He is an ordained deacon in the Catholic Church. He founded a special ministry for those with Alzheimer's Disease, which included his now-deceased wife. Blouin was director of the Iowa Department of Economic Development from January 2003 to July 2005, and became a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor in 2006. He was also a chamber of commerce executive. Gubernatorial bid Blouin lost a 2006 Democratic Party primary for Iowa governor, running against a field which included Iowa Secretary of State Chet Culver (the primary winner) and seven- term state representative Ed Fallon. Blouin had received the endorsement of more than 80% of the state's Democratic legislators and most of the state's labor unions, including the Teamsters and AFSCME. Blouin has an anti-abortion perspective on abortion but had stated that he will not sign any legislation limiting the right to an abortion, even if Roe v. Wade is overturned. He selected pro-choice business executive Andrea McGuire as his pick to be lieutenant governor. The selection of McGuire was initially questioned by the media and Blouin's opponents because she was registered as a Republican as recently as 2004 and has made past contributions to Republicans including Congressman Jim Nussle, the presumptive 2006 Republican nominee for governor. McGuire also made significant contributions to Democratic candidates within the same time span, and supported Howard Dean's 2004 presidential bid.

Hilse and later named by German scientist K. E. Hirn. The morphology of Oedogonium is unique, with an interior and exterior that function very differently from one another and change throughout its life cycle.

First named Oedogoniaceen (German), Hirn used his knowledge of the Latin language to describe and name the green algal genus; oedos meaning swelling/tumor, and gonos meaning offspring/seed. This name was meant to describe the morphology during sexual and asexual reproduction which he saw and described within his publication, “Monographie und iconographie der Oedogoniaceen”.

Hilse was a Polish phycologist who studied freshwater systems in hopes of learning more about microorganisms and how they interacted with their environment. Along with Oedogonium, Hilse is also credited with the discovery and classification of many diatoms. Mrozińska was the first to exam this group in terms of morphology, ecology and distribution and in his time described more than 400 species – mainly from southern Poland. In 1900, German scientist K.E. Hirn wrote a monograph concerning his finding of a new taxon, to which he promptly gave the name Oedogoniaceen – now Oedogonium. This paper was published and translated 60 years later. Hirn discovered Oedogonium in a ditch, appearing from June – October, but not much else is known as this was his only published contribution and he died in 1907 (7 years following his discovery). Pikosz, M., Messyasz, B. 2015: New data on distribution, morphology and ecology of Oedogonium capillare Kützing ex Hirn (Oedogoniales, Chlorophyta) in Poland. Biodiversity Research and Conservation; Poznan. Volume 40, 1:21-26. Since this 1900 monograph, this taxon has been vital in ongoing studies regarding biosorption of heavy metals – particularly lead – from fresh water ecosystems. Identification of species within Oedogonium is extremely difficult since I.D. factors are mainly based on reproductive characters, and very rarely are species in this genus discovered in their reproductive state. For the most part they exist in a filamentous form. In 1991 a paper by Mrozińska presented a new taxonomic classification of the genus Oedogonium and a proposed division into two sections: I. Monospermatozoideae and II. Dispermatozoideae. These sections were based on the different number of spermatozoids the antheridial (male sex organ containing) cell expresses. This classification is not widely accepted, as it still requires support through further studies. MorphologyExterior= Cells of the genus Oedogonium are narrow and cylindrical in shape. The algal body consists of green, un- branched, and multi-cellular filaments, arranged end to end. Every cell of the filamentous algal body (called the thallus) is similar in shape apart from the apical cell (the uppermost) and the holdfast cell (the lowermost). The apical cell is wider and always rounded at its tip (having a cap) relative to the other cells of the thallus. The holdfast cell, however, produces elongated growths from both unattached sides which aid in firmly attaching the filament to substrate. Guiry, M.D., Guiry, G.M. 2008: AlgaeBase. World-wide electronic publication, National University of Ireland, Galway. http://www.algaebase.org; searched on 13 February 2019. The holdfast is also the only colourless cell of the filament. All other cells in the filament exist as green structures very similar in nature, with only some cells having caps. The number of caps per cell illustrates the number of times that cell has divided. Every cell of the filament has a cell wall consisting of three layers – the innermost is made of cellulose, the middle of pectose, and the outermost is made of chitin. These three layers provide rigidity and protection for these benthic species. Most cells are attached to the substrate by the holdfast and are vegetative cells, although some are free-floating.Species of Oedogonium are divided into two major groups based on distribution of the sex organs: macrandous and nannandrous species. Macrandous species have a male sex organ (the antheridia) and female sex organ (the oogonia) produced on filaments of normal size. This group is further subdivided into macrandous monoecious and macrandous dioecious. In macrandous monoecious species, the antheridia and oogonia are always found on the same filament. In contrary, in macrandous dioecious species, the antheridia and oogonia are produced on different filaments. Although filaments bearing antheridia and oogonia are morphologically similar, they differ physiologically. In nannandrous species, filaments producing antheridia and oogonia show morphological distinction. The antheridia, which are much smaller than the oogonia, are called dwarf male. Nannandrous species are always dioecious; i.e. antheridia and oogonia are always produced on different filaments. Small male filaments are likely to be attached to a female filament, near an oogonium. =Interior= The protoplasm of Oedogonium is contained by a plasma membrane, and consists of a single nucleus, reticulate chloroplasts, cytoplasm and a central vacuole. Cell sap (contained by the central vacuole) is made up of inorganic compounds, excretions and secretions. Between the innermost cell wall and the central vacuole is a thin layer known as the protoplast. The single nucleus is large and oval shaped and sits in the centre of the cell – usually along the membrane and internal to the chloroplast. This large nucleus contains 1-2 nucleoli and elongated chromosomes. The reticulate, parietal chloroplast extends over the whole interior of the cell, enveloping the protoplast. Whether these networked strands are narrow or broad varies between species, but with most species these reticula are parallel to the long axis of the cell. At the strand junctions are pyrenoids, covered in starch plates. Cells of Oedogonium also contain very typical Golgi bodies, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum. Habitat and Ecology Oedogonium resides in freshwater ecosystems and prefers stagnant waters, such as small ponds, pools, roadside ditches, marshes, lakes, and reservoirs. It grows over a large pH range (7.3-9.6) and presents a wide tolerance to variation in nutrient type and amount in water. Cells exist either fastened to substrate at the bottom of the water system or free-floating within. When free-floating they form polyalgal patches (mats) on the water's surface to establish a relatively static habitat. Mats are created by interweaving multiple different algal filaments that are suspended in a gelatinous matrix. This matrix is a result of secretions by free floating thalli. Benthic cells are most often juvenile filaments and once matured they tend to let go, float to the top and form the mats. Oedogonium filaments typically appear during the warmer months, appearing at the end of June (north of the equator), and throughout July and August are found prevalent in polyalgal mats. Messyasz, B., Pikosz, M., Schroeder, G., Łęska, B. & Fabrowska, J. 2015: Identification and Ecology of Macroalgae Species Existing in Poland. Chapter 2, In: S.K. Kim & K. Chojnacka (eds.). Marine Algae Extracts: Processes, Products and Application. Mats formed by Oedogonium are multi-species, associated with Spirogyra, Rhizoclonium, and Cladophora. Together these species use holdfast cells to grip one another in order to photosynthesize. These mats/patches are also known as algal blooms. Life CyclesAsexual Reproduction= Oedogonium can reproduce asexually by fragmentation of the filaments, germination of aplanospores and akinetes, and through zoospores. In fragmentation, the filament splits apart and each fragment reproduces to form a fully functioning thallus. Splitting can occur more than once at the same position of the filament, explaining why some cells have more than one cap. The splitting of fragmentation may or may not be intentional – it could occur due to natural damage by the environment or predators. Asexual reproduction via zoospore is also very common and occurs in vegetative (benthic) cells. Vegetative cells produce zoosporangia – the enclosure in which spores are formed – which give rise to the zoospores. Each zoospore has a small hyaline anterior region, and at the base of this region is a ring of flagella (~150). Once emerged from the zoosporangium, a zoospore is still enveloped by a fragile vesicle, from which it is soon discharged. Following dispersal, the zoospore experiences a short period of motility in which it searches for a substrate. When attached to a substrate, the ring of flagella is lost, and the zoospore begins dividing to form a new filament. Germination of aplanospores and akinetes is uncommon but possible. An aplanospore is non- motile and formed within a vegetative cell, the wall of which is distinct from that of the parent cell. Under certain unfavourable conditions, aplanospores will secrete thick walls around them and store abundant food reserves. An akinete spore is large, non-motile, and thick walled, the wall of which is fused to that of the parent cell. Akinetes thick cell walls are enriched in food materials. Both aplanospores and akinetes are able to withstand unfavourable habitual conditions (cold, winter months or nutrient poor waters) and within these conditions remain dormant. With the onset of favourable conditions (such as warm winter months), they can germinate to form a new individual. As these processes are all forms of asexual reproduction, they do not produce genetic diversity in the offspring. Therefore, asexual reproduced Oedogonium are more vulnerable to changing environments. =Sexual Reproduction= Sexual reproduction in Oedogonium is oogamous; and can be monoecious or dioecious. Species may either be macrandrous (lacking dwarf males) or nannandrous (possessing dwarf males). Dwarf males are small, short, antheridium-producing filaments attached near the oogonia (female sex organ). These dwarf males are derived by repeated cell division of multiflagellate androspores. When an oogonial mother cell divides it forms a swollen oogonium bound by a supporting cell. Oogonial cells may exist in a series along the filament, and so division may also occur in a series; resulting in each oogonium containing a single egg. Production of an egg causes swelling of the cell wall, responsible for the name given by Hirn in 1900 – oedos (swelling) and gonos (seed/offspring). Antheridia are short and disk-shaped, containing 1 to 2 multi-flagellated sperm cells. Motile male gametes will exit the antheridia and are chemotactically attracted to oogonia. A single sperm cell will pass through a pore opening in the oogonial cell wall, allowing fertilization. Zygotes (oospores) are initially green but will gradually become an orange-red colour and develop a thick multilayered cell wall with species specific surface adornments. Meiosis occurs in the zygote prior to germination, producing four multi-flagellated cells after germination. Once freed from the oogonium, each daughter cell is only motile for a short period of time. All four cells may eventually attach to a substrate and then divide repeatedly to form new Oedogonium filament. The life cycle of Oedogonium is haplontic. The egg from the oogonia and the sperm from the antheridia fuse and form a zygote which is diploid (2n). The zygote then undergoes meiosis and reproduces asexually to form the filamentous green alga which is haploid (1n). Genetics Oedogonium nuclear genomes are rather unexceptional, and genome size and organisation remain largely unstudied within its phylum. Brouard, J.S., Otis, C., Lemieux, C. and Turmel, M. 2008: Chloroplast DNA sequence of the green alga Oedogonium cardiacum (Chlorophyceae): Unique genome architecture, derived characters shared with the Chaetophorales and novel genes acquired through horizontal transfer. BMC Genomics. Volume 1, 9:290. Oedogonium contain chloroplast with very distinct genome architecture. This genome is 196,547bp in length, and is the most compact among photosynthetic chlorophytes. It has a nonconforming quadripartite structure, with 17 group I and 4 group II introns – making it incredibly intron-rich. It has four long open reading frames (ORFs), containing 99 different conserved genes. Two of these ORFs showed high similarities to genes not usually found in cpDNA (chloroplast DNAs). The chloroplastic genome of Oedogonium reveals character evidence for a close alliance between the OCC clade. Although more data is required to validate these findings, there molecular signatures are strong supports for this dichotomy and for the branching of Oedogonium as the earliest-diverging lineage of the OCC clade. Practical Importance Recent studies from 2007 onwards have revealed that Oedogonium cells have a maximum high heavy metal absorption capacity (qe). The major mechanism of the lead–absorption interaction has been found to be ionic interactions and complex formation between metal cations and ligands contained within the structure of Oedogonium filaments. The biosorption of heavy metal ions by the Oedogoniales occur in two stages; an initial rapid uptake due to surface adsorption on the three major cell wall components, and then a subsequent slow uptake due to membrane transport of metal ions to the cytoplasm of the cells. The three cell surfaces of an Oedogonium filamentous cell consist of polysaccharides, proteins and lipids which provide several functional groups capable of binding to heavy metal ions. Oedogonium are readily available, non-toxic microorganisms which may be cultivated and/or cultured easily. Due to their position at the surface, algal blooms can block out the sunlight from other organisms and deplete oxygen levels in the water during peak summer months. Each alga included in the bloom is short-lived, and this results in a high concentration of dead organic matter. The decay process consumes dissolved oxygen in the water, resulting in hypoxic conditions. Without enough dissolved oxygen in the water, animals and plants may die off in large numbers.

When blooms are in effect, removing these cells has a positive effect on their ecosystem and may be dried and used to effectively absorb harmful heavy metals from other freshwater systems such as industrial wastes.Oedogonium can also significantly clog irrigation canals when growth on concrete surfaces becomes excessive due to high levels of benthic filaments. Removal of Oedogonium from clogged irrigation canals can also prove to be cost effective as they may once again be dried and used for absorption of heavy metals.

foundations of trade unionism in Kenya. Biography Makhan Singh was born in Gharjakh, a village in British-ruled India's Gujranwala district, a Sikh-majority area in the province of Punjab (since 1947, his native region has been a part of Pakistan). In 1927, at the age of 13, he moved with his family to Nairobi, a municipality which, since 1905, had functioned as the administrative capital of the British East African protectorate. In 1935, he formed the Labour Trade Union of Kenya and, in 1949, he and Fred Kubai formed the East African Trade Union Congress, the first central organization of trade unions in Kenya. Makhan Singh presents a new and unique challenge in analysing the history of political detentions and human rights. His eleven-year detention in the late 1950s in the desert prison camp near Lodwar, Northern Kenya, under the \\"control orders\\" issued by the British rulers of Kenya Colony, has become highly significant since both the Guantanamo Bay and Belmarsh Prison detentions of 2000. After having spoken out in clear and strong terms against British occupation and colonial rule in Kenya on 23 April 1950 at Nairobi's Kaloleni Halls, Makhan Singh was arrested within 21 days on 15 May. He had inadvertently given the British colonial masters an opportunity to silence him. At a trial in Nyeri, Chanan Singh (later Justice Chanan Singh) defended him eloquently and with rigour. He was acquitted. Like the Belmarsh Prisoners and their detentions in the UK, the then Kenya Colony Governor, Sir Philip Mitchell, ordered that he be detained for an indefinite period. He was released after eleven years of being confined without any charge or trial on 20 October 1961. His detainment and situations surrounding them is history repeating itself. Sir Philip Mitchell could not send him back to India after his acquittal as India was a new country- sovereign in its own rights. The British administrations idea of using its colonies and friendly (puppet) maharajas (kings) in various Indian kingdoms and Kala Pani (Andaman Islands) as convenient rendition sites for people who threatened the empire was a common practice. Makhan Singh was a resident in Kenya Colony. India ( a new democracy then 1947), would not accept his \\"rendition\\". Kenya was a centre of Ghadr/Kirti Party till 1947. Three Punjabis Bishan Singh of village Gakhal Jalandhar, Ganesh Das and Yog Raj Bali of Rawalpindi were summarily tried and hanged to death in public in December 1915 for possessing and distributing Ghadr. Between the world wars Makhan Singh, Gopal Singh Chandan (1898-1969) and Wasdev Singh (1904-1991) were its chief organisers. Quite a few Ghadr leaders, like Bhai Rattan Singh, Gurmukh Singh of LaltoN and Teja Singh Sutantar, passed through Kenya clandestinely en route to Russia for revolutionary training and back home. The Kenya Ghadr/Kirti secret branch sent Devinder Singh 'Katal' alias Lal Singh (c1900-1937) of Sansãrpur, Ujãgar Singh Kirti alias Aujla (1904-1970) of Boparai Kalãn Nakodar and Suba Singh (1894-1970) of Thathiãn Mahantãn Amritsar to Moscow for revolutionary training. Makhan Singh died of a heart attack on 18 May 1973 in Nairobi at the age of 59. Known Indian playwright Atamjit has written a play in Punjabi on the life and contribution of Makhan Singh. It was published from India in 2011. The play's reading sessions were organised in almost all the important places of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. It also got tremendous response in London, Nottingham and major cities of Canada. References *Chandan, Amarjit (2004). \\"Gopal Singh Chandan: A Short Biography & Memoirs\\".

Moor married Clara Ann Niel Cook (b. 1813 in Waterville, Maine) in 1834. She was a descendant of Thomas Dudley, one of the Governors of Massachusetts Bay Colony. Moor was appointed as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of John Fairfield. In later years he was the superintendent of a railroad construction project in Maine and was appointed by President James Buchanan as consul-general to British North America (i.e. Canada). After he left this position he retired from public life and relocated to Lynchburg, Virginia, where he had purchased an estate and became involved in an iron furnace operation and lived out his remaining years.

Similar to SR 678 to the north, it exists to connect U.S. Route 41 (US 41 or SR 45), Interstate 275 (SR 93), and US 41 Business (US 41 Bus. or SR 685). Despite its odd-numbered Florida Department of Transportation designation, SR 579 is signed east-west.American Map, Florida State Road Atlas, 2003 The current SR 579 is a remnant of a much longer one,Trakker Maps, Florida State Road Atlas 1994 extending from the current western terminus to an intersection with SR 54 near Zephyrhills, following Fletcher Avenue to an interchange with Interstate 75 (I-75 or SR 93A), then turning northeastward and following Morris Bridge Road through Branchton and toward SR 54. Fletcher Avenue between Nebraska Avenue and I-75 was later redesignated State Road 582A (and a spur, 50th Street between Fletcher Avenue and Fowler Avenue adjacent to University of South Florida, became State Road 582B) while Morris Bridge Road was transitioned to County Road 579. Eventually SR 582A and SR 582B were transferred to county control. Major intersectionsOther segments There are two other segments in Hillsborough County that carry the County Road 579 designation - one stretch from US 301 in Thonotosassa to SR 574 in Mango; and another from SR 674 in Wimauma to SR 62 east of Parrish in Manatee County. Historic State Road 579 In the 1950s and 1960s a different SR 579 was in existence, not in Hillsborough County but Dade (now Miami-Dade) County. Locally known as Biscayne Drive and Southwest 288th Street, the historic State Road 579 was a east-west street connecting South Dixie Highway (U.S. Route 1/SR 5) in Homestead to the west (primary) gate of Homestead Air Force Base.Dolph Maps, Map of South Dade County, Florida, 1954Official Map of Dade County, Florida, 1961Official Map of Dade County, Florida, 1962 While Homestead AFB was downgraded to a smaller Homestead Air Reserve Base after its destruction by hurricane Andrew in 1993, Coral Castle, a tourist attraction at the western end of historic SR 579, has remained essentially unchanged since the FDOT signs were removed from Biscayne Drive in the late 1960s. The predominantly rural nature of the area on both sides of the street in the 1950s and 1960s has been gradually giving way to urbanization since the 1980s and the trend appears to be accelerating throughout the former Homestead AFB property and further south in Miami-Dade County, particularly along the nearby Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike.

G. Wells' 1898 science fiction novel The War of the Worlds. It is a crawling device used by the Martians to lift and manipulate other objects. It is one of the four types of heavy machine the Martians bring with them when they invade Earth, along with the fighting machine, the flying machine, and the embankment machine. Description The handling machine is depicted making, moving, and assembling machinery under control of a single Martian. Handling machines are described as having five jointed legs, with numerous jointed levers and whip-like tentacles. They are described as \\"spider-like\\" and \\"crab-like\\", in both appearance and behavior. In Jeff Wayne's musical adaptation of The War of the Worlds, the handling machine was the primary vehicle for capturing humans, a cage being placed on the \\"back\\" of the machine. In the 1998 PC game, largely based on Jeff Wayne's album, the handling machine is used by the player to construct and maintain Martian facilities. It has two giant claws for smashing into buildings and two much smaller claws which come out of vents by the big claws. Handling machines appear in the 2005 Pendragon Pictures' adaptation H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds; these machines have six legs and a jointed tail and closely resemble a scorpion. No handling machine is seen in any other film adaptation. Crab-like walkers appear in The Asylum's modernized War of the Worlds film and are the Martian fighting-machines, not handling-machines. The novel's tripod appearance is absent from the film.

Biography Lamb was born in Alpine, New Jersey to Eliza Rollinson and Frederick Lamb. He was the nephew of the architect Charles Rollinson Lamb. He attended Columbia University, where his interest in the peoples and history of Asia began. Lamb's tutors at Columbia included Carl Van Doren and John Erskine.Twentieth Century Authors, a biographical dictionary of modern literature, edited by Stanley J. Kunitz and Howard Haycraft; (Third Edition). New York: The H.W. Wilson Company, 1950 (pp. 784-5). He received a Guggenheim Fellowship for twelve months, starting on April 1, 1929. . Guggenheim Fellowship. Lamb built a career with his writing from an early age. He got his start in the pulp magazines, quickly moving to the prestigious Adventure magazine, his primary fiction outlet for nineteen years. In 1927 he wrote a biography of Genghis Khan, and following on its success turned more and more to the writing of non- fiction, penning numerous biographies and popular history books until his death in 1962 in Rochester, N.Y. The success of Lamb's two-volume history of the Crusades led to his discovery by Cecil B. DeMille, who employed Lamb as a technical advisor on a related movie, The Crusades, and used him as a screenwriter on many other DeMille movies thereafter. Lamb spoke French, Latin, Persian, and Arabic, and, by his own account, a smattering of Manchu- Tartar. During World War II, Lamb was an OSS agent in Iran. Fiction Although Harold Lamb wrote short stories for a variety of magazines between 1917 and the early 1960s, and wrote several novels, his best known and most reprinted fiction is that which he wrote for Adventure between 1917 and 1936. The editor of Adventure, Arthur Sullivant Hoffman, praised Lamb's writing ability, describing him as \\"always the scholar first, the good fictionist second\\". The majority of Harold Lamb's work for Adventure was historical fiction, and can be thematically divided into three broad categories of tales: * Stories featuring Cossacks * Stories featuring Crusaders * Stories with Asian or Middle-Eastern Protagonists Lamb's prose was direct and fast-paced, in stark contrast to that of many other contemporary adventure writers. His stories were well-researched and rooted in their time, often featuring real historical characters, but set in places unfamiliar and exotic to most of the western audience reading his fiction. While his adventure stories had familiar tropes such as tyrannical rulers and scheming priests, he avoided the simplistic depiction of foreign or unfamiliar cultures as evil; many of his heroes were Mongolian, Indian, Russian, or Muslim. Most of his protagonists were outsiders or outcasts apart from civilization, and all but a very few were skilled swordsmen and warriors. In a Lamb story, honor and loyalty to one's comrades-in-arms were more important than cultural identity, although often his protagonists ended up risking their lives to protect the cultures that had spurned them. Those holding positions of authority are almost universally depicted as being corrupted by their own power or consumed with greed, be they Russian boyars or Buddhist priests, and merchants are almost always shown as placing their own desire for coin above the well-being of their fellow men. Loyalty, wisdom, and religious piety is shown again and again in these stories to lie more securely in the hands of Lamb's common folk. While female characters occasionally played the familiar role of damsel in distress in these stories, Lamb more typically depicted his women as courageous, independent, and more shrewd than their male counterparts. Their motives and true loyalties, though, remained mysterious to Lamb's male characters, and their unknowable nature is frequently the source of plot tension. Lamb was never a formula plotter, and his stories often turned upon surprising developments arising from character conflict. The bulk of his Crusader, Asian, and Middle-Eastern stories (as well as the latter stories of Khlit the Cossack) were written in the latter portion of his pulp magazine years, and demonstrate a growing command of prose tools; the more frequent use, for example, of poetic metaphor in his description. =Cossack tales= By far the largest number of these tales were short stories, novellas, and novels of Cossacks wandering the Asian steppes during the late 16th and early 17th century, all but a half-dozen featuring a set of allied characters. Two early books (Kirdy and White Falcon) reprinted the longest of these Cossack adventures, and two later books (The Curved Saber and The Mighty Manslayer) reprinted fourteen of the short stories; the four large Steppes volumes published by The University of Nebraska Press present all of Lamb's Cossack tales in their chronological order. The most famous of these Cossack characters is Khlit, a greybearded veteran who survives as often by his wiles as his swordarm; he is a featured character in eighteen of the Cossack adventures and appears in a nineteenth. He chooses to wander Asia rather than face forced \\"Cossack retirement\\" in a Russian monastery, and launches into an odyssey that takes him to Mongolia, China, and Afghanistan. He comes to befriend and rely upon folk he has been raised to despise, and briefly rises to leadership of a Tartar tribe before he wanders further south. His greatest friend proves to be the swashbuckling Muslim swordsman, Abdul Dost, whom he aids in raising a rebellion against the Moghul emperor in Afghanistan. In later stories Khlit returns as a secondary character, an aged advisor to both his adventurous grandson, Kirdy, and other Cossack heroes featured in separate stories. =Crusader tales= Unlike Lamb's Cossack stories, only a handful of his Crusader stories are inter-related. Two novelettes feature the young knight, Nial O'Gordon, and three short novels are centered around Sir Hugh of Taranto, who rediscovers the sword of Roland, Durandal. Durandal, published in 1931, reprinted all three novels of Sir Hugh with new linking material. Grant books' Durandal and The Sea of Ravens each reprint a single of these three novels. While Lamb's Crusaders sometimes battle against their traditional Muslim foes, the majority of these tales feature forays into deeper Asia. All of Lamb's Crusader stories have been collected in the 2009 Bison volume Swords from the West except for Durandal, The Sea of Ravens, and the forthcoming Rusudan, all from Donald M. Grant Co. Related stories with occasional Crusaders are collected in Swords from the Desert (Bison, 2009). =Asian and Middle-Eastern tales= Lamb also wrote a variety of stories featuring or narrated by Muslim, Mongol, or Chinese protagonists, set for the most part during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. \\"The Three Palladins\\" is a story of young Genghis Khan, told mostly from the viewpoint of one of his boyhood comrades, a Chinese prince. =Naval Stories= Lamb produced several stories of naval warfare with a historical setting. These included a number of fictions revolving around John Paul Jones in eighteenth century Russia.Charles Grayson, Half-a-hundred : tales by great American writers. Philadelphia : The Blakiston Company, 1945 (p.248) =Biographical historical novels= Lamb wrote several novels which were almost in the nature of dramatized biographies. Very little was invented beyond known history. =Lost World novels= Lamb produced several fantasy novels featuring lost worlds. These included Marching Sands, about a lost city of Crusaders in the Gobi Desert.David Pringle, The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Fantasy : the definitive illustrated guide.

Designed as a summer cottage for Alva and William Kissam Vanderbilt by the society architect Richard Morris Hunt, it was unparalleled in opulence for an American house when it was completed in 1892. Its temple-front portico resembles that of the White House. Located at 596 Bellevue Avenue, it is now open to the public as a museum run by the Preservation Society of Newport County. History The mansion was built as a summer \\"cottage\\" between 1888 and 1892 for Alva and William Kissam Vanderbilt. It was a social landmark that helped spark the transformation of Newport from a relatively relaxed summer colony of wooden houses to the now-legendary resort of opulent stone palaces. The fifty-room mansion required a staff of 36 servants, including butlers, maids, coachmen, and footmen. The mansion cost $11 million (equivalent to $ million in ); $660 million in Gold-dollar equivalence (1890 $20 Double Eagle gold coin) of which $7 million was spent on 500,000 cubic feet (14,000 m³) of marble.Yarnell, James L. (2005). Newport Through Its Architecture: A History of Styles from Postmedieval to Postmodern, pp. 137-41. University Press of New England. Vanderbilt's older brother Cornelius Vanderbilt II subsequently built the largest of the Newport cottages, The Breakers, between 1893 and 1895. The Chinese Tea House, modeled on 12th century Song Dynasty temples When Alva Vanderbilt divorced William in 1895, she already owned Marble House outright, having received it as her 39th birthday present. Upon her remarriage in 1896 to Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont, she relocated down the street to Belmont's mansion, Belcourt. After his death, she reopened Marble House and added the Chinese Tea House on the seaside cliff, where she hosted rallies for women's suffrage. Alva Belmont closed the mansion permanently in 1919, when she relocated to France to be closer to her daughter, Consuelo Balsan. There she divided her time between a Paris townhouse, a villa on the Riviera, and the Château d'Augerville, which she restored. She sold the house to Frederick H. Prince in 1932, less than a year before her death. For more than 30 years, the Prince family carefully occupied the house during Newport's summer season, taking special efforts to leave the vast majority of the interior intact as the Vanderbilts had originally intended. One notable event that occurred in the Marble House during the Prince family's residency was the famed Tiffany Ball in July 1957, sponsored by Tiffany & Company and held to benefit the relatively new Preservation Society of Newport County. Continuing late into the early morning hours, the ball welcomed guests with long national and international pedigrees, such as then Senator John F. Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy; Mr. and Mrs. E. Sheldon Whitehouse; the Astors; Count Anthony and Countess Sylvia Szapary of the Vanderbilt family; and hundreds of other luminaries. During their summer occupancies, to help preserve the integrity of Marble House's famed interiors, the Princes primarily resided in smaller quarters in the building's third floor, which had formerly been used for servant housing during the Vanderbilts' time. In 1963, the Preservation Society of Newport County purchased the house from the Prince Trust, with funding provided by Harold Stirling Vanderbilt, the Vanderbilt couple's youngest son. Through the Prince Trust, the Prince family donated virtually all original furniture for the house directly to the Preservation Society. The mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 10, 1971. The Department of the Interior designated it as a National Historic Landmark on February 17, 2006. The Bellevue Avenue Historic District, which includes Marble House and many other historic Newport mansions, was added to the Register on December 8, 1972 and subsequently designated as a National Historic Landmark District on May 11, 1976. The mansion still stands in great visible condition and is used for many things such as guided and non- guided tours, as well as hosting various special events, parties, and weddings. The Marble House is one of the more popular tourist destinations in Newport, RI. In keeping with custom of the time, the Vanderbilts also commissioned a sizeable carriage house to be built for Marble House diagonally across Bellevue Avenue, on what is now known as Rovensky Avenue. The Carriage House abuts Rovensky Park, which is maintained by The Preservation Society of Newport County. The Carriage House property is currently privately owned and has been converted for residential use. Design Rear facade, facing east toward the ocean Marble House is one of the earliest examples of Beaux-Arts architecture in the United States, with design inspiration from the Petit Trianon at the Palace of Versailles. Jules Allard and Sons of Paris, first hired by the Vanderbilts to design some of the interiors for their Petit Chateau on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, designed the French-inspired interiors of Marble House. The grounds were designed by landscape architect Ernest W. Bowditch.Hopf, John T. (1976). The Complete Book of Newport Mansions. The mansion is a U-shaped building. Although it appears to be a two-story structure, it is actually spread over four levels. The kitchen and service areas are located on the basement level, reception rooms on the ground floor, bedrooms on the second floor, and servant quarters on the hidden, uppermost level. The load-bearing portion of the walls are brick, with the exterior faced in white Westchester marble. Here Hunt adapted French neoclassical architectural forms of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to enliven the Beaux-Arts detailing. The facade of the mansion features bays that are defined by two story Corinthian pilasters. These frame arched windows on the ground floor and rectangular ones on the second on most of the facade. A curved marble carriage ramp, fronted by a semi-circular fountain with grotesque masks, spans the entire western facade. The masks serve as water spouts. The center of this facade, facing Bellevue Avenue, features a monumental tetrastyle Corinthian portico. The north and south facades match the western in basic design. The eastern facade, facing the Atlantic Ocean, is divided into a wing on each side. These wings semi-enclose a marble terrace and are surrounded by a marble balustrade on the ground floor level. The inset central portion of this facade differs from the others, with four bays of ground floor doors topped by second floor arched windows. The dining room, featuring pink Numidian marble and gilt bronze capitals and trophies The interior features a number of notable rooms. Entrance into the mansion is through one of two French Baroque-style doors, each weighing a ton and a half. Both are embellished by the monogram \\"WV\\" set into an oval medallion. They were made at the John Williams Bronze Foundry in New York. The Stair Hall is a two-story room that features walls and a grand staircase of yellow Siena marble, with a wrought iron and gilt bronze staircase railing. The railing is based on models at Versailles. An 18th-century Venetian ceiling painting featuring gods and goddesses adorns the ceiling. Architect Richard Morris Hunt hired Giuseppe Moretti to produce the interior's marble friezes and statuary, including work on bas-reliefs of Hunt and Jules Hardouin Mansart, the master architect for Louis XIV during the construction of Palace of Versailles; and which stood side by side on the mezzanine level of the staircase. The Grand Salon, designed by Allard and Sons, served as a ballroom and reception room. Designed in the Louis XIV style, it features green silk cut velvet upholstery and draperies. The originals were made by Prelle. The walls are carved wood and gold gilt panels representing scenes from classical mythology, inspired by the panels and trophies adorning the Galerie d'Apollon at the Louvre. The ceiling features an 18th-century French painting in the manner of Pietro da Cortona depicting Minerva, with a surround adapted from the ceiling of the Queen's Bedroom at Versailles. The Gothic Room, in the Gothic Revival-style, was designed to display Alva Vanderbilt's collection of Medieval and Renaissance decorative objects. The stone fireplace in the room was copied by Allard and Sons from one in the Jacques Cœur House in Bourges. The furniture was by Gilbert Cuel. The Library is in the Rococo-style. It served as both a morning room and library. The doors and bookcases, in carved walnut, were a collaboration between Allard and Cuel. The Dining Room features pink Numidian marble and gilt bronze capitals and trophies. The fireplace is a replica of the one in the Salon d'Hercule at Versailles. The ceiling is decorated painted with a hunting and fishing motif, with an 18th-century French ceiling in the center. Mrs. Vanderbilt's Bedroom, on the second floor, is in the Louis XIV style. The ceiling in this room is adorned with circular ceiling painting of Athena, painted circa 1721 by Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini. It was originally in the library of the Palazzo Pisani Moretta in Venice. Filming location The interiors of the mansion have appeared in several films or television series. Scenes appearing in the 1972–73 television series, America, the 1974 film, The Great Gatsby, the 1995 miniseries The Buccaneers, the 1997 film Amistad, and the 2008 film 27 Dresses were shot here. More recently, Victoria's Secret filmed one of their 2012 holiday commercials here. Gallery File:Marble House, William K. and Alva Vanderbilt mansion, Newport, Rhode Island) - Frank H.

Polesine (; ) is a geographic and historic area in the north-east of Italy whose limits varied through centuries; it had also been known as Polesine of Rovigo for some time. Nowadays it corresponds with the province of Rovigo in the viewpoint of political geography. In the viewpoint of physical geography it is a strip of land about 100-km long and 18-km wide located between the lower courses of the Adige and the Po rivers, limited to the east by the Adriatic Sea and leaving the western limit undefined.  Geography  The eastern portion of Polesine corresponds to the delta of the Po, and it is constantly expanding eastward because of the detritus sediment phenomenon. The Po and the Adige are the first and the third biggest rivers of Italy as for rate of flow, yet another river flows across Polesine between these two main rivers: the Canal Bianco; this means that by far most of the fresh water of Italy flows into the sea through Polesine. Due to this large amount of water it has to deal with, it has many canals for drainage. The biggest city is Rovigo (51,000 inhabitants), followed by Adria (20,000 people). Other important centres are Porto Viro, Lendinara, Porto Tolle, Badia Polesine, Occhiobello and Taglio di Po. Important agricultural centres are Arquà Polesine, Loreo, Polesella and Lusia.  Etymology  \\"Polesine\\" is a Venetian term (in classic script) from medieval Latin pollìcinum or polìcinum meaning \\"swamp\\" or \\"wetland\\"; this is because this territory was a swamp when it was given the name. This happened after the disasters in the Venetian hydrography that followed the decline of the Roman Empire.  History  Mythological origins of Polesine = Polesine's origins are connected with the myth of Phaeton, the young god who drowned with the Sun chariot in the river Eridano (the former name of the river Po). In Crespino, a small village in Polesine, there is a square (the chief one of the town) dedicated to Phaeton, to commemorate the old legend and the oral tradition saying that Phaeton died in the tract of the river Po crossing Crespino. = Ancient times = The Adige river flowed more to the north than nowadays and the main course of the Po river was more to the south (more or less it was the current Po of Volano channel). This means that in ancient times the area lying between the two rivers was much larger than the current area named Polesine. The Greeks founded Adria in the 12th -11th century BC on a former channel of the Po (nowadays it is the lower course of the Canal Bianco river); the channel was given the name Adria and the sea was given the name Adriatic after the colony name. The channel Adria was then recognized to be the lower course of the Mincio river, that was flowing into the Adriatic sea in ancient times. Etruscans and Venetians inhabited the area during the 6th and 5th centuries BC, then it was conquered by the Romans. Etruscans and Romans decontaminated the area by digging canals for drainage. Some historiansfor instance: think that the battle of the Raudine Plain of 101 BC could have been fought in this area. = Medieval and Modern history = After the fall of Rome and the disasters in the hydrography of the whole Veneto, traditionally referred to as the breach at Cucca in 589, Adria and its port lost their significance. In the meantime Rovigo was founded and fortified later in the 10th century, and provided of a city wall in the 12th century; it became the new centre of the area. In 1152, another disaster changed the hydrography of Polesine: a breach opened in the banks of the Po at Ficarolo and the new main course started flowing much closer to the Adige. The rulers of the whole area (except for the new delta of the Po) were the Este; the area was formerly named County of Gavello, but two centuries after the disaster and due to the decline of the Abbey of Gavello it started being named County of Rovigo. Progression of Polesine since 1484. Yellow area is the Territory of Polesine established in 1484 inside the Mainland State of the Republic of Venice after the War of Ferrara; red area is part of the lands that had been detached from the Papal States and was annexed to Polesine in 1815 to establish the Provincie of Rovigo inside the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia; greenish area is the other part of the lands that had been detached from the Papal States in 1815 but at first was annexed to the Province of Venice inside the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia; green and greenish areas together were detached in 1851 from the Province of Venice and annexed to the Province of Rovigo. Lighter land has recent formation, roughly from 1604 onwards. In 1484, after the end of the War of Ferrara, the Republic of Venice took possession of the area north of the Tartaro-Canalbianco, named \\"Polesine of Rovigo\\" by the Este because of its characteristic of being an island between rivers; other lands outside the proper named \\"Polesine of Rovigo\\" were also annexed, including the areas of Adria, Polesella and Guarda Veneta. All these areas established the Territory of Polesine inside the Domini di Terraferma (Mainland State) of the Republic of Venice. Polesine (located at the north-east in this map) and Emilia-Romagna in 1585. You can note that the main course of the Po was norther before the \\"cutting of Porto Viro\\" of 1604. The Este claimed again the possession of the whole Polesine during the war of the League of Cambrai, but after a short occupation in 1508-1511 the frontiers were back to those of 1484. Between 1602 and 1604, an agreement between the Republic of Venice and the Papal States that then ruled over the southern part of the Po delta allowed the digging of a new final course for the Po known as the \\"cutting of Porto Viro\\"; the toponym Taglio di Po means exactly \\"cutting of Po\\" and refers to this event, that has been the last change in the main course of the river until today. = Contemporary history = The middle and east parts of Polesine in 1885. You can note that the main courses of the Adige and the Po are those of nowadays. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815 all the lands to the north of the Po were included into the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia; part of these lands, the western and central lands, were annexed to the Territory of Rovigo to establish the Province of Rovigo in the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia. The eastern lands were at first annexed to the Province of Venice; on 1851 the whole Po delta was detached from the Province of Venice and attached to the Province of Rovigo, thus giving the Polesine the extension it has nowadays.  The floods  Due to the large amount of water passing through Polesine, many floods happened during the centuries. The main floods had been: * 589 (Adige): the disaster mentioned above as the breach at Cucca, that changed the main course of the Adige; * 950 (Adige): a breach opened at Pinzone, nowadays Badia Polesine, and the river diverted into the former course of the Tartaro; * 1152 (Po): the disaster mentioned above as the breach at Ficarolo, that changed the main course of the Po; * 1438 (Adige): again the main course of the river changed; it no more passed through Rovigo, and it has started flowing in the bed it has nowadays; * 1882 (Adige): the territory between the Adige and the Canalbianco was flooded; 63,000 people left the country and emigrated to South America. * 1951 (Po): two thirds of Polesine was flooded, compelling 150,000 people to evacuate the entire area.  Geological formation of the area  The Adige river as it enters the Polesine near Badia Polesine. Actual Polesine territory is, geologically speaking, of recent formation, created by drifts taken by rivers Po and Adige, and subsequently from human modifications. In fact, men reclaimed and decontaminated the area before embanking the biggest waterways. First origins goes up to the Pliocene epoch. Contemporary to the rising of Alps and Apennine Mountains, the entire Padania was filled by a long inlet (the Adriatic depression) and the seabed of this huge ditch was full of troughs and elevations. At the end of the last glaciation (10.000 years ago), most of Padania actual territory was just formed. Landscape's last mutation was due to the raising of the sea level and the ice melting. In 1604, river Po's natural course was artificially modified and after this work actual delta was formed. Floods frequently happened in Polesine filled the depressions of the area with several bundles of sediments consisting in sand, clay and silt.

He was also the father-in-law and son-in-law of Jugurtha, with whom he made war against the Romans. In the end, he made peace with Rome, delivering Jugurtha to the Romans in 105 BC. Life and Family Very little is known about Bocchus I and his kingdom during his time from historical sources. His kingdom was between the Atlantic Ocean and the Moulouya River (). As Salluste writes, at the time of the Jugurtha war all the Moors obeyed Sallust in his book Bellum Iugurthinum mentions that: According to Sallust, Bocchus had many wives, following the custom of Berber Moorish and Numidian leaders and kings. Of Bocchus's children only 4 are known: one daughter, whose name is unknown, married Jugurtha, and three sons, Sosus or Mastanesosus his royal successor, Volux, who was old enough to command troops, and another son named Bogud. It is likely that Bocchus I was the son or grandson of King Baga of Mauretania, who lived at the same time as King Massinissa of Numidia. Jugurthine War In 108 BC, he vacillated between Jugurtha and the Romans, and joined Jugurtha only on his promising him the third part of his kingdom. The two kings were defeated by the Romans at the Second Battle of Cirta. After the battle Bocchus started making overtures to the Romans again, and after an interview with Sulla, who was Gaius Marius's Quaestor at that time, sent ambassadors to Rome. In Rome the hope of an alliance was encouraged, but on condition that Bocchus showed himself deserving of it. After further negotiations with Sulla, he finally agreed to send a message to Jugurtha requesting his presence. Jugurtha fell into the trap and was given up to Sulla. Bocchus concluded a treaty with the Romans, and a portion of Numidia was added to his kingdom. Further to conciliate the Romans and especially Sulla, he sent to the Capitol a group of Victories guarding a device in gold showing Bocchus handing over Jugurtha to Sulla. This cites: * Sallust, Jugartha, 80-120 * Plutarch, Marius, 8-32, Sulla, 3 * A. H. J. Greenidge, History of Rome (London, 1904). King Bocchus I maintained good relations with Rome afterwards, supplying Romans with North African panthers and lions for entertainment. Successors Bocchus I was the father of Mastanesosus, and grandfather of Bocchus II and Bogud, both of whom inherited the kingdom and split it between them. Bocchus II eventually acquired Bogud's half of the kingdom. After his death in 33 BC, Mauretania became a client state of Rome.

Morane-Saulnier built 595 for the French air force, and it was also used by the British until 1916-17. Development French Morane- Saulnier P (MS.26) at Aisne, April 1917 In addition to being fitted with ailerons and having a more streamlined fuselage, the Type P was faster and better armed than its better known ancestor, the Type L (MS.3) and had a more developed structure compared to the intermediate Morane-Saulnier LA (MS.4). Three versions were built under Morane-Saulnier's factory designation of Type P, the first being the MS.21, which although externally similar to the Type LA, had its internal structure completely redesigned, with the most visible evidence being the more robust center section struts, and with other details borrowed from the Type N (MS.5), such as a substantial spinner, known as the \\"casserole\\". The MS.24 was built specifically for the Royal Flying Corps to operate alongside their Morane-Saulnier LAs while replacing those lost to attrition, but due to shortages of the Le Rhône rotary engine used in the MS.21, it was powered by an Le Rhône. The RFC also operated the MS.21. The MS.26 was similar to the MS.21, but was fitted with a Le Rhône engine which was enclosed in a full cowling, and like the 24, dispensed with the spinner commonly found on the MS.21.

I was talking about what he went to jail for, and I used a phrase like 'He took cash bribes to let drunk drivers go free.' And the copy desk changed it to quote judicial corruption unquote. And then after it ran, his sister called to complain that we had treated him shabbily by focusing on this Greylord business. I went in to Nigel Wade [the editor then] and I said, 'Look what you do. By editing the story for the family you cheat the million other readers of a strong description of his crime--and the family's still pissed off. You please nobody.' I would rather cheese off the few members of the family who are unredeemably biased than write some sort of pabulum they can put in their scrapbooks and is a trivialization of the truth.\\" (Steinberg almost surely was referring to his January 1997 obituary of a high-ranking Cook County judge in Operation Greylord, Richard F.

Before entering the treaty process with the United States, the Mississippi Chippewa consisted of the following sub-bands: * Cedar Lake Band * Crow Wing Band * Gull Lake Band * Mille Lacs Band * Pelican Lake Band * Pokegama Lake Band * Rabbit Lake Band * Rice Lake Band * Sandy Lake Band * Snake River Band * Swan River Band * Trout Lake Band * White Oak Point Band and many villages associated with these sub-bands. Together, they controlled the main north- south trade corridor of the Mississippi River headwaters. Their traditional use area included the stretch of the Mississippi River between its confluence with the Leech Lake River and its confluence with the Crow Wing River—known in the Ojibwe language as Gichi-ziibi (Big River)—and including the Brainerd Lakes Area. History and treaty making Prairie du Chien Line, 1825 Minnesota In 1825, with the First Treaty of Prairie du Chien, the United States drew the Prairie du Chien Line to separate the Ojibwe from the Dakota, believing the two were still at war with each other. The Ojibwe and the Dakota had ended their war for nearly a generation by that time and had only infrequent skirmishes. The Mississippi Chippewa, along with the Red Lake, Pillager and the Lake Superior bands, entered into the Treaty of St. Peters in 1837 with the US. They ceded to the United States what is now part of northern Wisconsin and east-central Minnesota. In 1850, the US government changed the annuity distribution point from La Pointe, Wisconsin to Sandy Lake, in an effort to move the tribes further west. Four thousand Ojibwe of various bands showed up in early October at the designated site, but no government agents or supplies were there. After waiting for two months in deteriorating weather, 170 Ojibwe died. The government finally brought the supplies and annuities but, because of harsh weather at that time of year, another 230 Ojibwe died on their returns to their lands.\\"Ojibwe honor 400 victims of 1850 Sandy Lake tragedy\\" , Brainerd Dispatch, 2 December 2000, accessed 8 March 2012 This became known as the Sandy Lake tragedy. Reservations of the Mississippi Chippewa in MinnesotaIn 1855, because of the tragedy at Sandy Lake, the Mississippi Chippewa, along with the Pillager Band of Chippewa Indians, agreed upon the Treaty of Washington for the land cession of most of northern Minnesota. In exchange, the United States promised three reservations for the Pillagers and six reservations for the Mississippi Chippewa. In addition, as in other treaties, the tribes retained the right for traditional harvest of off-reservation resources, such as fish and game. (This right faded from general knowledge as living conditions changed, until it was revived in the late 20th century as tribes worked to exercise traditional practices and rights; one example was the Wisconsin Walleye War of the late 1980s.) The six reservations were the following: * Gull Lake Indian Reservation * Mille Lac Indians Reservation * Pokegama Lake Indian Reservation * Sandy Lake Indian Reservation * Rabbit Lake Indian Reservation * Rice Lake Indian Reservation Due to confusing records kept by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the Rice Lake Indian Reservation was never established. Confusion arose because several different lakes around Sandy Lake had names which, translated into English, all seemed to mean \\"Rice Lake.\\" This led to confusion related to which map was consulted, and the issue of where the reservation was to be located was never resolved. It appeared the Rice Lake Indian Reservation was located in the following areas: *fully within the boundaries of the Sandy Lake Indian Reservation on its north end, or *adjacent to the Sandy Lake Indian Reservation on its south end; and *at the southeastern corner on the eastern edge of Sandy Lake Indian Reservation, or *on the southeastern corner on the southern edge of Sandy Lake Indian Reservation. The Rice Lake Band claimed these representations were all incorrect, and the proper location of the agreed Rice Lake Indian Reservation was much farther south. In the Dakota War of 1862, waged against European-American settlers, many Chippewa bands aided the Dakota people. The Sandy Lake Band remained fully neutral during the conflict. When Chief Máza-mani (Iron-Walker) (Mille Lacs Indians) learned of the plans of Chief Bagone-giizhig (Hole-in-the-Day) (Gull Lake Band) to attack Fort Ripley, Máza-mani raised a party of 200 men to aid the Americans. They reached the fort and aided in its defense before Chief Bagone-giizhig arrived, thus averting his attack. Both the Sandy Lake and Mille Lacs bands gained protection from the United States as a result. All other Mississippi Chippewa were forcibly removed from their reservations to the area surrounding the Leech Lake and Lake Winnibigoshish reservations. Due to strife between the removed Mississippi Chippewa and the Leech Lake Pillager and the Lake Winnibigoshish bands, the Mississippi Chippewa negotiated with the United States for resettlement. The Pokegama Lake Band, together with the few Removable Sandy Lake Band, negotiated to remain in the area and eventually formed the White Oak Point Band on the White Oak Point Reservation. In 1934 it merged with the Cass Lake, Chippewa, Lake Winnibigoshish and Leech Lake Indian reservations to form the contemporary Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe and its reservation. With the signing of the 1867 Treaty of Washington, the remaining Mississippi Chippewa about Leech Lake agreed to resettlement to the west, creating the White Earth Reservation. In the 20th century, the bands combined to form the contemporary White Earth Band of Chippewa. Under pressure from the lumbermen and farm settlers who wanted native lands, the US government believed the White Earth Reservation was the answer to the \\"Chippewa Problem\\" and strongly pressured the Mille Lacs and the remaining Sandy Lake bands to relocate there. Many did, becoming the \\"Removable\\" peoples, while those who remained in their traditional territories in the central part of the state became the \\"Non-removable\\". Successors apparent Though the Mississippi River Band of Chippewa Indians no longer exists legally, the majority of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe and White Earth Band of Chippewa still identify as Mississippi Chippewa.

You'll Never Get Rich) in the late 1950s, and as the stumbling, overconfident quasi-outlaw biker Eric Von Zipper in beach party films during the 1960s. He also turned in noteworthy performances in both the stage and screen versions of Stalag 17. He was the father of actor and director Michael Lembeck and actress Helaine Lembeck. Early life Born in Brooklyn, Lembeck started his career right out of New Utrecht High School, as a dancer at the 1939/40 New York World's Fair. He was half of an exhibition dance team known as The Dancing Carrolls. His partner, Caroline Dubs, became his wife.Staff (March 28, 2013) \\"Harvey Lembeck Stays Liked\\" Classic Film and TV Café The son of a Brooklyn button manufacturer, Lembeck yearned for a career as a radio sports announcer. Following his discharge from the United States Army at the end of World War II in 1945, he attended New York University, obtaining a degree in radio arts in 1947. However, he chose the stage as a career upon the advice of one of his instructors, Prof. Robert Emerson, who had seen him perform in college plays.\\"Harvey Lembeck and the Ratz and Mice Cast Music of the Beach Party Movies\\" BeachPartyMovieMusic.com Lembeck was Jewish.Abramovitch, Ilana and Galvin, Seán (2002) Jews of Brooklyn Boston: Brandeis University Press.

Lembeck made three films for 20th Century Fox, You're in the Navy Now, Fourteen Hours, and The Frogmen, all released in the first half of 1951. He went back to Broadway as Sgt. Harry Shapiro in Stalag 17, subsequently playing the same role in the film version directed by Billy Wilder, earning the Theater Owners of America's Laurel Award for outstanding comedy performance and best possibility for stardom. From 1952 to 1954 Lembeck also made nine other films, mostly playing military roles. In 1954, he returned to Broadway, appearing in the play Wedding Breakfast. That same year, he appeared with Skip Homeier in the episode \\"Eye for an Eye\\" of the NBC legal drama Justice, based on case studies of the Legal Aid Society of New York. His stint with Phil Silvers' popular Sergeant Bilko series began in 1955. Lembeck played Bilko's sidekick, Corporal Rocco Barbella. The show ran for four years. Lembeck also performed onstage in 1955 in the musical revue Phoenix '55, played Luther Billis in the 1957 production of South Pacific p.279 Dietz, Dan The Complete Book of 1950s Broadway Musicals Rowman & Littlefield, 2 Jul 2014 and from 1959-1961 was the standby for the role of Fiorello LaGuardia in the musical Fiorello!.\\"Harvey Lembeck\\" on the Internet Broadway Database =1960s and 1970s= In the 1961-1962 television season, Lembeck played a theatrical agent, Jerry Roper, in the ABC sitcom The Hathaways, starring Peggy Cass and Jack Weston as \\"parents\\" to the performing Marquis Chimps. He appeared twice as \\"Al\\" in \\"Variations on a Theme\\" and \\"Music Hath Charms\\" (both 1961) on another ABC sitcom, The Donna Reed Show. Having spent a great deal of his adult life in uniform, Lembeck once again donned Navy togs in the 1962-1963 season to co-star with Dean Jones in the NBC sitcom Ensign O'Toole. He co- starred with Steve McQueen in Love with the Proper Stranger and then spent part of the early 1960s playing the lovable bad guy malaprop Eric Von Zipper in six American International beach party films, with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. (He did not appear in the second \\"beach\\" film, 1964's Muscle Beach Party.) The Von Zipper character, leader of the Rat Pack motorcycle gang, was a parody of Marlon Brando's role in The Wild One (Von Zipper reveals in Beach Blanket Bingo that one of his idols was \\"Marlo Brandon\\".) Among other things, Von Zipper pronounced his judgments on others by saying \\"Him, I like\\", or \\"Him, I do not like\\". In 1964 he also co-starred with Debbie Reynolds in The Unsinkable Molly Brown. In 1964, Jack Kosslyn of the Mercury Theatre asked Lembeck to take over his actors' workshop. Lembeck took this opportunity to create his comedy workshop. Initially working with comedy scripts, he soon ran out of good comedy material and found that improv was a wonderful tool to teach and exercise comedy. He realized that the improv method, new in the early 1960s, was one of the best ways to develop actors' comedy instincts. Lembeck returned to the theatre to star as Sancho Panza in the first national company of Man of La Mancha. President Lyndon Johnson chose this company to give a command performance at the White House. During the late 1960s and 1970s, Lembeck became a mainstay on television, making over 200 guest appearances, including Ben Casey, Mr. Novak, The Munsters, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Route 66, The Monkees, Night Gallery, It Takes a Thief, The Partridge Family, Chico and the Man, Vega$, All in the Family, Batman and Mork and Mindy. Lembeck also directed the road companies of Stalag 17 and Mister Roberts, along with the revues A Night at the Mark in San Francisco and Flush in Las Vegas. Death Lembeck continued to perform and teach acting up until his death from a heart attack on January 5, 1982. He was performing in an episode of Mork and Mindy when he took ill, collapsed as he was leaving the set and died. He was age 58. In an interview taped shortly before his own death in 1985, Phil Silvers said he was shocked and saddened by the untimely death of his friend Lembeck, and missed him terribly.Interview taken from Sgt.

It is one of the old Russian folk art handicrafts, which still exists in a village of Dymkovo near Kirov (former Vyatka). Traditionally, the Dymkovo toys are made by women. The tradition of making pennywhistles in the form of a horse, a horse rider, and a bird goes back to the ancient magic ritual images and has to do with the agricultural calendar holidays. Later, the little figures lost their magic meaning and turned into toys for children, the making of which would become an artistic handicraft. Up until the 20th century, this toy production had been timed to the spring fair called свистунья, or whistler. The first recorded mentioning of this event took place in 1811, but it is believed to have existed for some 400 years, thus dating the history of the Dymkovo toy at least from the 17th century. In the late 19th century the handicraft fell into decline because the Dymkovo toys had been forced out of the market by the factory-made moulded plaster statuettes, which imitated porcelain articles. During Soviet times, however, the Dymkovo handicraft was revived. In 1933, they organized an artel called Вятская игрушка (The Vyatka Toy), which would turn into a workshop of the Artistic Fund of the RSFSR (). These days, the Dymkovo toys are known as a popular Russian souvenir. Dymkovo toys The Dymkovo toys are moulded from a mixture of local potter's clay and river sand. The parts are then fastened together with watery clay. After the toys are dried and tempered in a furnace, they are whitewashed with chalk diluted in milk, then painted with tempera (before 1953, the artists used aniline paints ground with eggs) in 4 to 10 (or more) colors, and decorated with gold leaf. Modern Dymkovo toys include ancient motifs, as well as those of the second half of the 19th century, such as барыни (barynyas, or landladies), няньки (nyanki, or nannies), водоноски (vodonoski, or female watercarriers) and others. In the 1930s, the Dymkovo toys began to depict fairy tales and a contemporary lifestyle. There were also multi-character compositions on stands, and figures of people taller than 30 cm. Massive, abstract, and somewhat grotesque forms of the Dymkovo toys are emphasized by ruffles, puffed collars, and other features. The improvised bright painting of the toys represents a geometric ornament of circles, checks, and dots of different colors and sizes.

Brandley was working as a janitor supervisor at Conroe High School in Conroe, Texas where Fergeson was a 16-year-old student athlete visiting the school from Bellville, Texas. Brandley was held for nine years on death row. After lengthy legal proceedings and community outcry that eventually ended in the Supreme Court of the United States, Clarence Brandley was freed in 1990. After his release, Brandley was involved in further legal proceedings over child support payments that had accrued over his time in prison, and ultimately with an unsuccessful $120 million lawsuit against various agencies of the State of Texas. The crime Conroe High School, where the murder occurred. Cheryl Dee Fergeson, a 16-year-old junior at Bellville High School, was murdered on August 23, 1980. Fergeson was part of a school volleyball team playing a match against another high school in Conroe, Texas. Her body was found in the loft above the school auditorium. Suspicion immediately fell on two of the custodians, Brandley and Henry (Icky) Peace, who had found the body. During their joint interrogation – as Peace would recount – Texas Ranger Wesley Styles told them, \\"One of you is going to have to hang for this\\" and then, turning to Brandley, added, \\"Since you're the nigger, you're elected.\\"Innocence and the Death Penalty 9.Dow, 121. InvestigationCo- workers' statements= The three claimed to have seen the victim enter a girls' restroom near the school gymnasium, and then to have seen Brandley walking toward the restroom with an armload of toilet paper. They claimed that they told Brandley there was a girl in the restroom, and that he replied that he was taking the toilet paper to the boys' restroom. They did not see him again until about 45 minutes later, after a search had begun for the missing student. The fourth white custodian, Peace, subsequently added that Brandley was insistent on immediately searching the loft and, when they found the body, calmly checked for a pulse and then notified the authorities. All four said that only Brandley had keys to the auditorium where the body was found.Radelet 121. =Brandley's statements= Before an all-white Montgomery County grand jury on August 28, 1980, five days after the crime, Brandley professed innocence. Although he contradicted his white co-workers in several respects, he acknowledged that he had disappeared for perhaps 30 minutes about the time the murder was believed to have occurred. He said he was in the custodian's office smoking and listening to music alone.Radelet, 122. He also testified that a number of other persons had master keys that would open the auditorium and, in any event, that doors near the stage usually were propped open with a two-by-four. Trials December 1980 = Brandley went on trial in December 1980 before an all-white jury.Dow, 121. The prosecution's case was based entirely on circumstantial evidence and witness statements, as there was no physical evidence linking Brandley to the crime. Pubic hair with so-called \\"negroid characteristics\\" were allegedly found on the body, but no expert testimony was given at trial to indicate they belonged to Brandley. These hairs were subsequently lost from the prosecution's exhibits and have never been recovered. Spermatozoa recovered from the victim's body had been destroyed – without having been tested to determine whether Brandley could have been its source. Moreover, a fresh blood spot had been found on the victim's blouse that had not come from her and could not have come from Brandley. The spot was Type A, but Brandley had Type O blood.Davies, 203. One juror found the evidence insufficient to establish guilt, forcing Judge Sam Robertson, Jr. to declare a mistrial. The name of the holdout juror, William Shreck, became public knowledge, leading to anonymous harassing telephone calls.Applebome, 26. One man, whose anonymous communication was monitored by police, threatened Shreck, \\"We're going to get you, nigger lover.\\"Radelet, 124. = February 1981 = Brandley's second trial in February 1981 was held before a different judge, but another all-white jury. The prosecution did not call John Sessum, one of the original witnesses. Later it was discovered that the prosecution had decided not to use Sessum because he no longer was willing to support the other custodians' versions of events, even though he had been threatened with being charged with perjury if he refused to go along.Davies, 278-279. The prosecution presented a different witness who had not testified previously. He was Danny Taylor, a junior at the school, who had worked briefly as a custodian but was fired before the crime. Taylor claimed that Brandley had once commented – after a group of white female students walked past them – \\"If I got one of them alone, ain't no tellin' what I might do.\\"Radelet, 124. Dr. Joseph Jachimczyk, medical examiner for Harris County, testified that the victim had died of strangulation and that a belt belonging to Brandley was consistent with the ligature used in the crime. In closing argument, District attorney James Keeshan mentioned that Brandley had a second job at a funeral home and suggested that perhaps he was a necrophiliac and had raped Fergeson after she was dead — an argument that could not have been made in good faith because Keeshan had a report stating that Brandley only did odd jobs at the funeral home and had never been involved in the preparation of bodies for burial. The defense objected to Keeshan's remark as inflammatory, but Judge John Martin overruled the objection. Post-conviction Eleven months after Brandley was convicted and sentenced to death, his appellate lawyers discovered that exculpatory evidence had disappeared while in the custody of the prosecution, including a Caucasian pubic hair and other hairs recovered from Fergeson's body that were neither hers nor Brandley's.Haines 88. Also missing were photographs taken of Brandley on the day of the crime showing that he was not wearing the belt that the prosecution claimed had been the murder weapon. The missing evidence was all the more troubling in light of the pretrial destruction of the spermatozoa. Much was made of the willful destruction and disappearance of the potentially exculpatory evidence in Brandley's appellate briefs, but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction and death sentence without mentioning the issue. \\"No reasonable hypothesis is presented by the evidence to even suggest that someone other than [Brandley] committed the crime\\", said the court. Brandley V. Texas, 691 S.W.2d 699 (1985). Brenda Medina, who lived in the nearby town of Cut and Shoot, Texas, saw a television broadcast about the Brandley case. Saying she had been unaware of the case until then, she told a neighbor that her former live-in boyfriend, James Dexter Robinson, had told her in 1980 that he had committed such a crime. Robinson had previously worked as a janitor at Conroe High School. Medina said she had not believed Robinson at the time, but now it made sense.Gordon 18. At the neighbor's suggestion, she went to see an attorney, who took her to see District Attorney Peter Speers III, who had succeeded Keeshan in the job when Keeshan ascended to the Texas District Court bench. Speers quickly concluded, or so he said, that Medina was unreliable, and therefore that he had no obligation to inform Brandley's lawyers. The private attorney she had consulted thought otherwise, however, and brought her to the attention of the defense. =State habeas corpus sought= After obtaining Medina's sworn statement, Brandley's lawyers petitioned the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for a writ of habeas corpus. The court ordered an evidentiary hearing, which was conducted by District Court Judge Ernest A. Coker. Before calling Medina to testify at the evidentiary hearing, Brandley's defense team called Edward Payne, father-in-law of Gary Acreman, one of the school custodians who had testified at both Brandley trials and who was now suspected by the defense of having been a co-perpetrator of the crime with Robinson. Payne testified that Acreman had told him where Fergeson's clothes had been hidden two days before the authorities found them. After Medina related details of Robinson's purported confession, Brandley's lawyers called John Sessum, the custodian who had testified at the first trial but not the second. Sessum's testimony was in sharp contrast to what he had said at the first trial. He now said he had seen Acreman follow Cheryl Fergeson up a staircase leading to the auditorium and then heard her scream, \\"No\\" and \\"Don't.\\" Later that day, Acreman warned Sessum not to tell anyone what he had seen. But Sessum said he did tell someone: Wesley Styles, the Texas Ranger who was leading the investigation. That was a mistake. Styles, according to Sessum, responded by threatening him with arrest if he did not tell a story consistent with Acreman's. =Community activism and result= Despite the accumulation of new evidence, Judge Coker recommended that Brandley be denied a new trial – a recommendation perfunctorily accepted by the Court of Criminal Appeals on December 22, 1986. But by now civil rights activists, including Reverend Jew Don Boney, had coalesced and raised $80,000 to help finance further efforts on Brandley's behalf. The Rev. Boney was the Chairman of the Houston, Texas-based \\"Coalition to Free Clarence Lee Brandley\\" and spearheaded community efforts to have Brandley receive a fair trial. Boney was interviewed on numerous national news outlets and brought significant media and community attention to the case. National Advocate James McCloskey, of Centurion Ministries in Princeton, New Jersey, also took on the case. Working with a private investigator, McCloskey soon obtained a video-taped statement from Acreman stating that Robinson had killed Cheryl Fergeson and that he had seen Robinson place her clothes in a dumpster where they were found; that is how Acreman knew where the clothes were before they were found. Although Acreman soon recanted that video statement, two witnesses had come forward attesting that they had heard Acreman say he knew who killed Fergeson, that it was not Brandley, but that he would never tell who did it. Based on these statements, with Brandley's execution only six days away, Coker granted a stay. =A fair hearing= After further investigation, Brandley's lawyers petitioned for another evidentiary hearing, which the Court of Criminal Appeals granted on June 30, 1987. The new hearing was conducted by Special State District Judge Perry Pickett. Robinson, Acerman, and Styles testified for the prosecution, each seeming to help rather than hurt Brandley's case. Robinson admitted he had told Brenda Medina in 1980 that he had killed the young woman in Conroe, but claimed he had said that only to frighten Medina. She had been pressuring him because she was pregnant, he said, and he simply wanted her to stop pestering him. Acreman stuck by what he had said at both trials, although he admitted that Robinson had been at Conroe High School the morning of the murder. Incidentally, Robinson and Acreman, unlike Brandley, had Type A blood — consistent with the spot on Fergeson's blouse. Texas Ranger Styles, while denying he had done anything improper, acknowledged that even before he had interviewed any witnesses, Brandley was his only suspect. When pressed about why he had not obtained a hair sample from Acreman to compare with the Caucasian pubic hair and other hairs found on the victim, Styles stammered, \\"Let's say I didn't do it and it wasn't done, and why it wasn't done, I don't know.\\" On October 9, 1987, Judge Pickett recommended that the Court of Criminal Appeals grant Brandley a new trial, declaring: \\"The litany of events graphically described by the witnesses, some of it chilling and shocking, leads me to the conclusion the pervasive shadow of darkness has obscured the light of fundamental decency and human rights.\\" The Court of Criminal Appeals, after sitting on the case for 14 months, finally accepting Picket's recommendation with a sharply split en banc decision on December 13, 1989 (Ex Parte Brandley, 781 S.W.2d 886 (1989)). The prosecution appealed, delaying disposition of the case another 10 months. But within hours of the U.S. Supreme Court's denial of certiorari on October 1, 1990 (Texas v. Brandley, 498 U.S. 817 (1990)), they dropped all charges. A few months later, Brandley was ordained as a Baptist minister, and a few months after that he was married. The officials involved in the case were not disciplined, nor did they apologize. Prosecutors in the case still insist they convicted the right man.

Located at 424 Bellevue Avenue, it is now owned by the Preservation Society of Newport County and is open to the public as a museum. Chateau-sur-Mer's grand scale and lavish parties ushered in the Gilded Age of Newport, as it was the most palatial residence in Newport until the Vanderbilt houses in the 1890s. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2006. Description and history Chateau-sur-Mer was completed in 1852 as an Italianate villa for William Shepard Wetmore, a merchant in the Old China Trade originally of St. Albans, Vermont. The architect and builder was Seth C. Bradford, and the structure is , constructed of Fall River Granite. It is regarded as a landmark of Victorian architecture, furniture, wallpapers, ceramics, and stenciling.2003 Herald News Article on Fall River Granite Wetmore died on June 16, 1862 at Chateau-sur-Mer, leaving the bulk of his fortune to his son George Peabody Wetmore. George married Edith Keteltas in 1869. During the 1870s, the Wetmores departed on an extended trip to Europe, leaving architect Richard Morris Hunt to remodel and redecorate the house in the French Second Empire style. As a result, Chateau-sur-Mer displays most of the major design trends of the last half of the 19th century. Hunt's alterations greatly expanded the house, adding a new three-story wing, a porte-cochere, and a projecting four-story tower with mansard roof. The carriage house was also enlarged, in a manner sympathetic to Bradford's original design. Hunt also designed the entrance gate of the estate which is somewhat Greek Revival in style, but with posts modeled after Egyptian obelisks. The centerpiece of the mansion's interior is its great hall, a massive three-story chamber with a ceiling and broad balconies. The billiard room is in the Eastlake style, with oak timbers aligned diagonally on the ceiling and herringbone flooring. The library has an Italianate design and was actually designed and built in Italy, then disassembled and transported to Newport. The marble hallway originally served as the house's main entrance and is finished with a variety of different marble colors. It was closed off in 1920 by replacing the main door with a bay window. The green room served as a ladies' reception area and was designed in 1900 by Ogden Codman, Jr. in the Louis XV style. The ballroom is decorated with crystal chandeliers and fine plaster, one of the few rooms that remained relatively unaltered by Hunt's work. The dining room is in Renaissance Revival style and was also built in Italy. Chateau-sur-Mer was one of the few Newport \\"cottages\\" built as a year- round residence, unlike most of the others built during this period, because the Wetmores were a New England family who made Newport their home. George was very active in Rhode Island politics during the late 19th century and a lifelong Republican. He was a member of the Electoral College of 1880 and again in 1884; he was elected Governor of Rhode Island in 1885 and went on to win re-election in 1886, but he was defeated in an attempt for a third term in 1887. In 1894, the Rhode Island General Assembly elected him to the United States Senate, where he remained until 1913. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1968 and purchased by the Preservation Society of Newport County in 1969. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2006. The former carriage house and stables for the Chateau-Sur- Mer estate are owned by Salve Regina University and are currently being renovated as a center for visual art and preservation known as Wetmore Hall.

He played with the Stan Kenton Orchestra and served as one of Kenton's primary staff arrangers.Sandomir, Richard. New York Times obituary. \\"Lennie Niehaus, Who Set Eastwood’s Films to Music, Dies at 90\\". June 10, 2020 He also played with Ray Vasquez and trombonist and Vocalist, Phil Carreon and other jazz bands on the U.S. West Coast. Niehaus had a close association as composer and arranging to motion pictures produced by Clint Eastwood.  Life and career  Education and active years as a musician = Niehaus was born in St. Louis, Missouri on June 1, 1929 to Aaron \\"Père\\"and Clariss (Weissman) Niehaus. His mother was a homemaker. His father, a Russian immigrant, was a violinist who played in an orchestra that accompanied silent films in theaters. In the mid-1930s, after talking pictures had taken hold, he moved the family to Los Angeles, where he played in Hollywood studio orchestras. His sister was a concert pianist. His father started him on violin at age seven, then he switched to bassoon. At thirteen, Niehaus began alto saxophone and clarinet, about this time he began composing. In 1946, after graduation from Roosevelt High School, Niehaus started to study music at Los Angeles City College later earning a music education degree from Los Angeles State College in 1951 as part of the school's first full graduating class. Niehaus began his professional career arranging for and playing alto saxophone with Phil Carreón and His Orchestra in the Los Angeles area. Members of the band included saxophonists Herb Geller, trombonist Ray Vasquez, Herbie Steward, and saxophonist Teddy Edwards. = Stan Kenton Orchestra = After completing college in 1951, Niehaus got his start with the Stan Kenton Orchestra and toured with the band for six months out on the road. His association with Kenton would be interrupted as he was drafted into the Army in 1952 and served at Fort Ord in California. After being discharged in 1954, he rejoined Kenton for five years as the lead alto saxophonist. He composed and arranged extensively for the Kenton band being a feature soloist and having numerous arrangements featured on Kenton's Capitol Records releases. He had the longest and most recorded tenure of any of the lead alto players with the group to include such names as Charlie Mariano, Lee Konitz, Gabe Baltazar, or Tony Campise. Niehaus left the Kenton orchestra as an instrumentalist in 1959 to pursue music composition in the studios, “I put my horn away and started writing instead.”Marble, Steve. Obituaries. Los Angeles Times. \\"Lennie Niehaus, L.A. jazz pioneer and longtime Clint Eastwood composer, dies at 90\\" JUNE 9, 2020. 1:59 PM He continued to serve as a staff arranger for Kenton into the 1960s. He would go on during that time to write and arrange music for entertainers acts such as the King Sisters, Mel Tormé, Dean Martin, and Carol Burnett. = Orchestrating and composing for television and film = By the age of 33, in 1962, he began orchestrating for television and film composer Jerry Fielding. Niehaus worked with Fielding on approximately seventy TV shows and films like Hogan's Heroes, Charlie’s Angels and McMillan & Wife. Films on this list include Straw Dogs (1971), Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974) by Sam Peckinpah, the comedy The Bad News Bears (1976), and the horror film Demon Seed (1977). After Fielding’s death Niehaus came into his own as a leading film composer; he always did his own orchestrating for his scores not using any ghost writers. In his film scores, Niehaus never forgot his jazz roots. The story of the film City Heat (1984) was set in the 1930s, so he wrote jazz of that period hiring people like altoist Marshal Royal. Bill Perkins came in and played like Lester Young; a jazz violinist sounded like Stéphane Grappelli. There was also a boogie woogie sequence with three pianists Pete Jolly, Mike Land and co-star Clint Eastwood.  Work with Clint Eastwood  With Clint Eastwood, Niehaus had probably his most significant professional relationship. The two men had first met when serving together in the U.S. Army at Fort Ord during 1952 - 1954. Both found they had a passion for jazz music. Niehaus had already orchestrated scores for films starring Eastwood like Tightrope (1984), also produced by Eastwood. But it was not until Eastwood's eleventh film as director, Pale Rider (1985), that Niehaus actually wrote the first entire score for one of his films. Niehaus then wrote the musical scores for the following twelve films up to Blood Work (2002), and orchestrated the music for the next six features that Eastwood completed, from Mystic River (2003) to Gran Torino (2008). Niehaus won the BMI Film & TV Awards for Heartbreak Ridge (1986), Unforgiven (1992), The Bridges of Madison County (1995), and Space Cowboys (2000). The most substantial collaboration between Niehaus and Eastwood related directly to jazz, was the 1988 biographical film on Charlie Parker, Bird. Besides a Golden Globe for Eastwood as best director, an Academy Award for best sound and many others, the score by Niehaus was nominated for a BAFTA Award, and won 2nd place at the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards, shared between Niehaus and Charlie Parker, due to a production process that had managed to electronically isolate Parker's saxophone solos from the original recordings and backed them with modern stereo recordings.  Other awarded film scores  Lennie Niehaus wrote the music for another jazz related feature, the 1993 TV movie Lush Life, in which Forest Whitaker, who played Charlie Parker in Bird, also starred as a jazz saxophonist. Niehaus won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Miniseries, Movie, or a Special. In 2008 he was nominated again for Oprah Winfrey Presents: Mitch Albom's For One More Day. = Further works and educational publishing= His work includes Spiritual Jazz Suite, four pieces arranged for brass quartet, three sets of Christmas Jazz suites (4 pieces in each) and a Christmas Jazz Medley arranged for saxophone quartet. His educational publishing includes a book of classical saxophone duets, a beginning/intermediate/advanced method books for the understanding of jazz technique, and a book of jazz saxophone duets exemplifying jazz styles. After many years of not playing his alto saxophone at all, Niehaus returned to performing, reportedly in top form.

Biography Edwards was born in Jackson, Mississippi, United States. He learned to play at a very early age, first on alto saxophone and then clarinet. His uncle sent for him to come to Detroit to live because he felt opportunities were better. Due to illness in the family, he went back to Jackson and ventured to Alexandria, Louisiana. He was persuaded by Ernie Fields to join his band after going to Tampa, Florida. Edwards had planned to go to New York City, but Ernie Fields convinced him he could get there by way of Washington, DC, if he worked with his band. Teddy ended up at the \\"Club Alabam\\" on Central Avenue in Los Angeles, which later became his city of residence. Teddy Edwards played with many jazz musicians, including his personal friend Charlie Parker, Roy Milton, Wynonie Harris, Vince Guaraldi, Joe Castro and Ernie Andrews. A 1947 recording with Dexter Gordon, The Duel, was an early challenge to another saxophonist an approach he maintained whenever possible, including a recording with Houston Person. One such duel took place in the 1980s at London's 100 Club with British tenor Dick Morrissey. In 1964, Edwards played with Benny Goodman at Disneyland, and at the 1964 New York World's Fair. Edwards performed and recorded with Tom Waits. He toured with him on the Heart Attack and Vine tour and played to a packed Victoria Apollo in London with Waits and a bassist (the drummer had apparently been left behind after some dispute). The 1991 album Mississippi Lad features two tracks with Waits, and Waits covers the Edwards-written ballad \\"Little Man\\" on his Orphans collection. He died in Los Angeles of prostate cancer, with which he had been diagnosed in 1994, at the age of 78.https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/23/arts/teddy-edwards-78-deft-star-of-los- angeles-jazz-scene.html DiscographyAs leader/co-leader= *1947 The Foremost! – with Dexter Gordon (Onyx #201; shared various artists LP with Leo Parker and Wardell Gray) *1948 Central Avenue Breakdown, Vol. 1 (Onyx #212; shared various artists LP with Vivien Garry/Arv Garrison and Dodo Marmarosa) *1949 Central Avenue Breakdown, Vol. 2 (Onyx #215; shared various artists LP with Barney Kessel and Slim Gaillard) *1958 Sonny Rollins at Music Inn/Teddy Edwards at Falcon's Lair (Metrojazz) with Joe Castro - split album featuring Sonny Rollins tracks *1959 It's About Time (Pacific Jazz) with Les McCann *1960 Sunset Eyes (Pacific Jazz; reissued on Blue Note) *1960 Teddy's Ready!

The Giants selected Taylor in the sixth round of the 2004 NFL Draft out of Texas A&M.; Jamaar was a promising prospect until he suffered a knee injury in college that drastically hurt his draft status. Some experts considered him a second round pick before his injury. During his rookie season, Jamaar had a 100-yard game against the Philadelphia Eagles where he played against fellow Mission High School alumni Koy Detmer who is now the head coach there. On the year he caught four passes for 146 yards. Jamaar spent most of his time in the NFL on the injured reserve list, but showed some promise during the preseason and during his 100-yard game against the Eagles. Ultimately his knee problems lingered and cut his career short as his retirement was announced on June 2, 2006. During a game against the Minnesota Vikings, Taylor was pushed into the sidelines on a punt and crashed into Vikings head coach Mike Tice. Tice needed knee surgery as a result of the collision which he had after the conclusion of the season. High school years Taylor attended Mission High School (Mission, Texas) and was a letterman in football. In football, he was a three-year letterman, twice named the teams' Most Valuable Player, and as a senior, was an All-State selection.

Till played in local bands until the early 1960s when he was picked to play in Ronnie Hawkins band The Hawks, to replace previous members who had left to tour with Bob Dylan (see The Band). After touring with Hawkins, the members of this band moved to New York City to try to establish themselves as musicians in the larger US market. Till became a studio musician and was doing commercial sessions. While doing this commercial work, Till was hired as a touring musician, working for Janis Joplin on her Full Tillt Boogie Band, as a side project with Till's fellow Canadian band members. This group had been playing mostly in the local New York Area, but when Janis Joplin's management convinced her to discard Big Brother and the Holding Company as her backing band, her record label put together a new group of musicians for her. This group, The Kozmic Blues Band, was a group of studio musicians that Joplin's label were familiar with and could depend on. This group recorded I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!, which was released in 1969. Janis Joplin's Kozmik Blues Band were the group Joplin performed with at the original Woodstock concert; however, Joplin was not happy touring with some of the members of this group, feeling some of them to be too \\"square\\". Joplin and her management then hired Till, bass player Brad Campbell, as well as pianist Ken Pearson (from nearby Woodstock, Ontario), to fill out her new band, called Full Tilt Boogie. The band appeared on The Dick Cavett Show and were booked on the Festival Express which toured across Canada. The group recorded their classic Pearl album, which reached the No. 1 spot on the Billboard charts in 1971, after Joplin's death.

It is located on the corner of Main Street and South Temple in Salt Lake City. It is now a social center with three restaurants: The Roof Restaurant, The Garden Restaurant and The Nauvoo Cafe. It is also a venue for events complete with 13 banquet rooms, catering services, event coordinators and a full-service floral department - Flowers Squared. Several levels of the building also serve as administrative offices for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) departments such as FamilySearch. On January 3, 1978, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Hotel Utah.  History Hotel Utah, 1925. The corner of Main Street and South Temple has long been important in Utah history. Prior to construction of the Hotel Utah from 1909 to 1911, the general tithing office of the LDS Church, a bishop's storehouse, and the Deseret News printing plant all were located on the site. Work on the Second Renaissance Revival style hotel, designed by the Los Angeles architectural firm of Parkinson and Bergstrom, began in June 1909. Two years later, on June 9, 1911, the Hotel Utah opened for business. While the LDS Church was the primary stockholder, many Mormon and non-Mormon community and business leaders also purchased stock in the effort to provide the city with a first-class hotel.http://db3-sql.staff.library.utah.edu/lucene/Manuscripts/null/Ms0469.xml/complete \\"The largest and finest bar in the West [was built] in the basement of the Hotel\\" to pay off a $2 million construction loan. The financing was secured by the LDS Church's presiding bishop, Charles W. Nibley, from New York financier Charles Baruch. But the scheme obviously required the sales of hard liquor. Originally, the hotel allowed black employees, but no black guests. This policy extended to famous entertainers. Lillian Evanti, Harry Belafonte, Marian Anderson, and Ella Fitzgerald were all denied hotel rooms. Anderson was eventually allowed to stay at the Hotel, on condition that she did not use the elevator and eat her meals in her hotel room. In 1947, the first non-white professional basketball player, Wataru Misaka, signed his first NBA contract at this hotel. At the time of his signing, according to Misaka, nonwhites were not allowed to stay in this hotel. The ten-story building has a concrete and steel structure and is covered with white glazed terra cotta and brick. Various additions and remodelings have occurred throughout the years, including a substantial expansion to the north and modifications to the roof- top dining facilities. It was featured in the 1973 film \\"Harry in Your Pocket\\" starring James Coburn. The building ceased operations as a hotel in August 1987. A major remodeling and adaptive reuse project to accommodate both community and church functions was completed in 1993. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints] Church leader Gordon B. Hinckley chose the name when he observed that there were many monuments to pioneer leader and Utah founder Brigham Young, but none to Joseph Smith. The building was decorated with the words \\"SALT LAKE 2002\\" during the Winter Olympics. 2011 marked the celebration of 100 years since initial construction was completed on the Hotel Utah.  Current use  The chapel in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building. The LDS Church now uses this building as follows: * A large, historical, ornately decorated multi-story lobby, featuring a large white statue of Joseph Smith, and an enormous crystal chandelier. Live classical music is often performed here as background. * The FamilySearch center, where the public can use the provided computers and materials to do family history research and genealogy. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints] * The Legacy Theater, where the public can view regularly scheduled free showings of various church- produced movies. The theater originally showed Legacy: A Mormon Journey and subsequently has also shown The Testaments of One Fold and One Shepherd, Joseph Smith: Prophet of the Restoration, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints] and Meet the Mormons. * Two restaurants, The Roof and The Garden, on the top (tenth) floor, provide views of downtown Salt Lake City. * Interior levels of the building house various church administrative departments, including those supporting the worldwide family history centers, and other activities. * Many rooms on the ground level, and on the ninth and tenth floors, can be rented out for wedding receptions or dinners. * There is a chapel used for the Sunday services of various downtown wards. The chapel contains a Casavant Frères pipe organ with 2,484 pipes in 45 ranks across two manuals.

Sandra Bullock stars as Gwen Cummings, a newspaper columnist obliged to enter rehabilitation for alcoholism. The film costars Viggo Mortensen, Dominic West, Elizabeth Perkins, Steve Buscemi, and Diane Ladd. Plot Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock) spends her nights in a drunken haze with her boyfriend, Jasper (Dominic West). She ruins her sister (Elizabeth Perkins) Lily's wedding by showing up late and disheveled, delivering a drunken, rambling speech, and knocking over the wedding cake. Intoxicated, Gwen steals a limousine from the reception, tries to locate a cake store, and winds up losing control of the car and crashing into a house. She is given a choice between jail time or 28 days in a rehab center, and she chooses rehab. Gwen is introduced to a variety of patients while in treatment: Oliver (Mike O'Malley) (a hypersexual cocaine addict), Daniel (Reni Santoni) and Roshanda (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) (alcoholics), Bobbi Jean (Diane Ladd) (an older addict), Gerhardt (Alan Tudyk) (a gay man whose addiction is not specified), and Cornell (Steve Buscemi), the rehab facility's director (a recovered drug addict and alcoholic). Her roommate is young Andrea (Azura Skye), a heroin addict who sporadically self-harms and is a fan of the fictitious soap opera Santa Cruz. Initially, Gwen is angry and resistant to taking part in any of the treatment programs on offer, refusing to admit that she is an alcoholic. On visiting day, Jasper shows up and slips her a bottle of medication, then the two sneak off for a day of drinking and drugging. Later, Gwen returns to the facility, clearly inebriated. The next day, Gwen is confronted by Cornell. He informs her that she's being kicked out of rehab the next day and will be going to jail instead. Gwen angrily denies that she has a problem with alcohol, that she can stop anytime that she wants. Ignored, she angrily makes her way back to her room, where she rifles through her tissue box to get to her smuggled drugs. She puts a pill in her mouth but quickly spits it back out, then tosses the open bottle out the third-story window. All throughout the day, Gwen experiences withdrawal symptoms. She shuns the meetings and any activities, all the while desperately trying to push through her physical discomfort on her own. Later that evening, in a moment of weakness, she attempts to climb out her window and retrieve the discarded meds. She falls, severely spraining her ankle, and is rescued by Eddie (Viggo Mortensen), a pro baseball player and fellow addict, who is just arriving as a new patient. The next morning, Gwen asks Cornell for another chance, finally convinced that anyone who would climb out of a three-story window to chase a high might have a problem. He relents; and Gwen finally begins to participate in the recovery process, growing closer to her fellow addicts and her roommate, Andrea. Gwen discovers that Eddie is also a fan of Santa Cruz, and their fellow group participants join Eddie and Andrea in catching up on tapes of the show. During therapy sessions, Gwen experiences flashbacks of a childhood that included a thrill-seeking addict mother who died of an overdose when Gwen was about six, leaving young Lily and Gwen to be raised by an aunt. On one of his visits, Jasper proposes to Gwen, bringing champagne to celebrate. Not wanting to jeopardize her newfound sobriety, Gwen throws the champagne into the lake. Later, her fellow addicts try to encourage her to see that Jasper isn't taking her sobriety seriously and to be careful. At some point, Gwen's sister Lily attends a group therapy session but leaves in disgust when Gwen become dismissive of Lily's recollections and resentments of her younger sister's drunken antics. Eddie and Gwen's friendship grows closer. Afraid to share what she'd done as a practicing alcoholic for fear of looking bad to Eddie, they share a moment when Eddie tells her that's just what she's done. She is just fine as she is. They are come upon by Jasper, who showed up unannounced. Jasper then proceeds to insult and pick a fight with Eddie, shoving him. Eddie punches him before Gwen stops any further violence. Eddie walks off, and Gwen and Eddie's friendship becomes estranged. Gwen's roommate, Andrea, is soon to be released and has been agitated and moody at the prospect, as well as heartbroken that her mother has never visited her during her entire stint in rehab. Gwen discovers Andrea dead in their bathroom, clearly having overdosed. Andrea's death leaves Gwen devastated and perhaps wiser as to how an addict's behavior affects others. Gwen commits herself to restoring her relationship with her sister. Gwen and Lily reconcile, and Gwen leaves treatment, but not before Eddie warns her that Jasper is dangerous to her sobriety. Back in New York, Jasper tries to make amends to Gwen for his behavior. Reconciling, Gwen tries to help Jasper to understand what needs to change in their relationship to support her recovery; but she soon sees that Jasper doesn't take her sobriety seriously. Seeing old party friends, Jasper wants to join them, demonstrating that he won't change his lifestyle or adjust to her needs and abstentions as a recovering addict. Gwen comes to terms with the fact that they are too different now and starts to see that recovery, though an everyday struggle, might be attainable. She breaks up with Jasper and walks away for good. Some time later, she is reunited with a sober Gerhardt at a floral shop. In a post-credit scene, Eddie recognizes a Santa Cruz character, Falcon, arrive as a new patient at the rehab facility.

He played with the big bands of Woody Herman and Stan Kenton and worked in the studios of the recording and television industries. Career A native of Mishawaka, Indiana, Pete Candoli was the older brother of Conte Candoli. During the 1940s he was a member of big bands led by Sonny Dunham, Will Bradley, Ray McKinley, Tommy Dorsey, Teddy Powell, Woody Herman, Boyd Raeburn, Tex Beneke, and Jerry Gray. For his ability to hit high notes on the trumpet he was given the nickname \\"Superman\\". While he was a member of Woody Herman's First Herd, he sometimes wore a Superman costume during his solo. In the 1950s he belonged to the bands of Stan Kenton and Les Brown and in Los Angeles began to work as a studio musician. His studio work included recording soundtracks for the movies Bell, Book and Candle, Private Hell 36, Save the Tiger, The Man with the Golden Arm, and The Prisoner of Second Avenue and appearing with The Tonight Show Band. Pete Candoli and his brother Conte formed a band that performed in the late 1950s and early 1960s and intermittently from the 1970s to the 1990s. In the early 1970s he performed in nightclubs with his second wife, singer Edie Adams. Heart surgery delayed his career at the end of the 1970s, but he returned to performing at musical festivals and with Lionel Hampton. He reunited with the Woody Herman band for its fifty- and sixty-year anniversary concerts. Candoli was featured on the cartoon series The Ant and the Aardvark, which used a jazz score for its theme and musical cues. Candoli died of complications from prostate cancer on January 11, 2008, at the age of 84. Conte Candoli died of the same disease in 2001.

It was negotiated and signed by William Blount, governor of the Southwest Territory and superintendent of Indian affairs for the southern district for the United States, and various representatives of the Cherokee peoples, most notably John Watts. The treaty established terms of relations between the United States and the Cherokee, and established that the Cherokee tribes were to fall under the protection of the United States, with the United States managing all future foreign affairs for all the loosely affiliated Cherokee tribes. A monument to the treaty, erected in 1997, is located on the banks of the Tennessee River in downtown Knoxville, Tennessee, where the treaty was negotiated. Terms This treaty mentions the following: * Establishment of perpetual peace and friendship between the two peoples. * Cherokees acknowledge protection of United States. * Prisoners of war to be returned. * Boundaries established between the Cherokee lands and the United States. * Stipulation of a road by the United States. * United States to regulate trade. * Guarantees by the United States that the lands of the Cherokee people have not been ceded to the United States. * No U.S. citizens may settle within the Cherokee lands; those who do may be punished by the Cherokee. * No U.S. citizens may hunt within the Cherokee lands. * The Cherokee must deliver up criminals to the United States. * U.S. citizens committing crimes within the Cherokee areas are to be punished. * Retaliation restrained by both nations. * Cherokees to give notice of pending attacks by other tribes against the United States. * United States to make presents to the Cherokees for the promotion of having the Cherokees take up an agrarian culture. * Both peoples to cease any animosities held against each other. An addendum to treaty was signed by Henry Knox, Secretary of War, representing the United States and representatives of the Cherokee on February 17, 1792, and proclaimed on the same day, which increased the annuities paid by the United States to the Cherokee leaders. Below is an excerpt from a letter of the War Department Dated January 17, 1792, by Secretary of War Henry Knox \\"That the main business of the said Cherokees seems to consist in the following points: 1st, To obtain an higher annual compensation for the lands they relinquished by the treaty with Governor Blount, on the 2d day of July 1791. 2dly, That the white people who are settled to the southward of the ridge which divides the waters of the Tenassee from those of Little River, should be removed, and that the said ridge should be the barrier. 3dly, That a person of Reputation should be commissioned in behalf of the general Government to reside in the Cherokee Nation, who should at once be their Counsellor and protector. 4thly, That the projected settlement of the Tenassee Company at the muscle shoals, should be prevented.1 5thly, That the annual allowance of Goods should be now furnished together with some ploughs and other implements of husbandry, as mentioned in the Treaty. 6thly, That John Thompson, who is a half Creek and James Carey, should be appointed interpreters agreeably to the recommendation of Governor Blount—it is proposed to add George Miller, the full blooded Cherokee to the Interpreter⟨s⟩—He has claims on the Government for services in the North Carolina troops—having as he alleges, served with them for several years. He is young, good humoured, well disposed to the United States, and his appointment would be highly grateful to the Indians, as well as to himself, and would be considered as a reward for his past services which must now be supported by evidence.\\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05-09-02-0273-0002 See also *List of treaties *List of Cherokee treaties ReferencesExternal links *Text of the Treaty Category:1791 in the United States Category:1791 treaties Category:1792 treaties Holston Category:History of the Cherokee ","title":"Treaty of Holston"},{"id":"2471025","text":"Michael Francis Barbiero (born June 25, 1949)Infidel Biography .

Amthor. History Iron Crown Enterprises published Spacemaster in 1985. ICE published their new Spacemaster: Privateers RPG (2000) while in chapter 11. ICE's last remaining role-playing lines - Rolemaster, Spacemaster and Shadow World – as well as the ICE brand itself were all that was left by 2001, and everything that was left was sold to John R. Seal of London for $78,000; those rights were then placed into Aurigas Aldebaron LLC, which is a holding company that takes on no debt and is solely intended to hold the ICE properties. Shortly after purchasing the ICE rights, Aurigas licensed them out to a company interested in continuing ICE's production: Phoenix LLC, which shortly after became Mjolnir LLC; although the original ICE was gone, Mjolnir began doing business as \\"ICE\\", using the company's IPs and brand. Mjolnir restarted the Spacemaster: Privateers line, which updated the Spacemaster mechanics to be more like the Rolemaster Standard System mechanics. As problems developed with the ICE brand, Aurigas Aldebaron decided to pull all of Mjolnir's ICE- related rights, and after recovering the ICE IPs from Mjolnir, Aurigas licensed the rights to HARP, Rolemaster and Spacemaster to Guild Companion Publications. Publication history Space Master was designed by Kevin Barrett and Terry K. Amthor, with a cover by Gail McIntosh and illustrations by Jason Waltrip and Dan Carroll, and was published by Iron Crown Enterprises in 1985 as a boxed set with two books (one 96 pages, one 88 pages), a 16-page pamphlet, three color maps, and a counter sheet. The second edition was published in 1986; a third edition with a cover by Walter Velez was published in 1988 as a boxed set which included three books (one 128 pages, one 96 pages, one 80 pages), and two color maps. There was also a second edition reprint in 1992 in a combined softcover book ( ICE2600 #9050). Contents Space Master is a science-fiction space-adventure system, fairly complex, and compatible with Cyberspace, Rolemaster, and to a lesser extent Middle-earth Role Playing. The first and second editions included the \\"Future Law\\" and \\"Tech Law\\" book, a booklet of spaceship plans, plus maps and counters for spaceship combat. The third edition (which the publisher calls the second edition) is revised and expanded, with three new booklets. The \\"Player Book\\" (128 pages) covers: character creation (a detailed class-and-level system); a complex and comprehensive combat system; skills and activity resolution; and extensive psionic powers rules. The \\"GM Book\\" (80 pages) covers: star system and planet creation; 40 pages of background data on the Empire, a far-future interstellar realm; guidelines for alternate milieus; how to run adventures and create encounters; and information on alien races. The \\"Tech Book\\" (96 pages) covers all sorts of futuristic equipment, including weapons, tools, armor, computers, robots, clones and cyborgs, vehicles, and spaceships (including deck plans for nine examples); also includes malfunction and repair rules and detailed charts of weapon effects. The third edition boxed set also includes a two-piece color star map of the Empire. Description Spacemaster is an adaptation of, and mostly compatible with, the Rolemaster Fantasy Roleplaying system, and as such any perceived failings/strengths of the latter also apply to Space Master. Spacemaster is available in two editions, namely Spacemaster 2nd Edition (analogous and broadly compatible with Rolemaster 2nd Edition and Rolemaster Classic) and Spacemaster Privateers (analogous and compatible with Rolemaster Standard System and Rolemaster Fantasy Role Playing). Iron Crown Enterprises has published several expansions, including Space Master Companion I, Space Master Companion II and Aliens & Artifacts, as well as numerous adventure modules and setting sourcebooks. A cyberpunk adaptation of the system, called Cyberspace was also published, along with a smaller number of supplements. Spacemaster 2 The Space Master System is usable in a variety of SF environments, from a black near future of post-holocaust Earth, to a culture of high-tech exploration, to a distant time where civilization has fallen to superstitious ruin. Spacemaster has 17 professions, dozens of sub-professions, over 120 skills and a rich selection of background options. Spacemaster Trilogy: * 1. Space Master: The Role Playing Game is completely compatible with all Space Master Modules, and is the first part of a Science Fiction Gaming Trilogy. * 2. Space Master: Star Strike (Fall 1988), a fast-paced game of interplanetary ship combat, puts you in the gunner’s chair as you face enemy starships. * 3. Space Master: Armored Assault (Winter 1988-89), moves the combat planetside, where Hovertanks, Powered Armor, and Aircraft vie for supremacy. * Note: Space Master can also be integrated with Rolemaster; used together they set the stage for sweeping, coherent, science- fantasy campaigns. The default setting for Spacemaster 2 is the classic Imperium setting, where a human empire spans the galaxy in a future thousands of years hence. Noble houses, megacorporations, and other organisations vie for influence and more in a setting rich in transhumans, robots, psionics, aliens, and other exotica.

The stadium, which opened in 2005, is located in Santa Clara, California, USA. Stadium history A new baseball stadium for the Santa Clara University Broncos was first conceived of in January 2004 when Stephen Schott, noted 1960 alumnus, baseball enthusiast and, at the time, owner of the Oakland Athletics, announced he was donating $4 million to project. The Santa Clara University baseball team had been playing in 6,800 seat, multipurpose Buck Shaw Stadium, which they shared with the soccer team and, until 1993, the football team. Lack of space on the university's side of El Camino Real (Route 82) forced SCU to build the stadium across the street. It was built in approximately one year, but did not open in time for the 2005 baseball season as originally planned due to cost overruns and weather-related delays. Instead, it opened on April 30, 2005 to a sold out game between Santa Clara University and Gonzaga University. The final cost of the stadium was $8.6 million. The stadium hosted a Super Regional tournament between Dallas Baptist University and California June 11–13, 2011. The neutral site was selected since neither school has an adequate on-campus facility to host the best-of-three series. Stadium design The stadium features a grass playing surface in the infield and outfield, a Fieldturf foul territory to keep maintenance costs down. Schott Stadium seats 1,500. The upper rows of the stadium consist of bench type bleachers with backs while the lower rows consist of tip up seating. A dugout for the home team was added to Schott Stadium. The stadium's of building space features locker rooms, showers, and a trainer's area for both home and visiting teams. The SCU locker rooms features a team room equipped for live game feeds, team meetings, and press conferences. A VIP Building consists of a full press box, and a luxury suite behind home plate. Two additional buildings on-site consist of a concession and ticket office and a hitting center. The outside of the stadium features a traditional brick facade similar to Camden Yards and other \\"retro\\" ballparks.

Before that, he served as Director of Research at Synaptics.  Life and work  Platt was born in Elgin, Illinois and matriculated at California State University, Long Beach at the age of 14. After graduating from CSULB at the age of 18, he enrolled in a computer science PhD program at California Institute of Technology. While a student at Caltech under astronomer Gene Shoemaker, he discovered two asteroids, 3259 Brownlee and 3237 Victorplatt at Palomar Observatory on 25 September 1984. The latter he named after his father Victor Platt, while the former was named by Gene Shoemaker. Shoemaker allowed Platt to name one of his discoveries, 3927 Feliciaplatt, which he named after his mother. In August 2005, Apple Computer had its application for a patent on the interface of the popular iPod music player rejected by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The reason appears to be that Platt had submitted a patent application for a similar interface design five months prior to Apple's claim.

Intermediate between a pithos (large storage vessel) or amphora (transport vessel), and individual cups or bowls, it held fluid for several persons temporarily until it could be poured. The term oinos (Linear B wo-no) appears in Mycenaean Greek, but not the compound. The characteristic form was popular throughout the Bronze Age, especially at prehistoric Troy. In classical times for the most part the term oinochoe implied the distribution of wine. As the word began to diversify in meaning, the shape became a more important identifier than the word. The oinochoe could pour any fluid, not just wine. The English word, pitcher, is perhaps the closest in function. Beazley's ten types There are many different forms of oenochoae; Sir John Beazley distinguished ten types. The earliest is the olpe (ὀλπή, olpḗ), with no distinct shoulder and usually a handle rising above the lip. The \\"type 8 oenochoe\\" is what one would call a mug, with no single pouring point and a slightly curved profile. The chous (χοῦς; pl. choes) was a squat rounded form, with trefoil mouth. Small examples with scenes of children, as in the example illustrated, were placed in the graves of children.Beazley Archive, Oxford University, \\"Oinochoe, olpe and chous\\" Characteristics of oenochoae Oenochoae may be decorated or undecorated.Woodford, S. (1986). An Introduction to Greek Art. London: Duckworth, p. 12. Oenochoae typically have only one handle, which may be opposite a trefoil mouth and pouring spout. At its most distinct development, the trefoil mouth offers three alternative directions of pouring, one opposite the handle, and two to the side, an advantage at a crowded table not afforded by English pitchers. Their size also varies considerably; most, at up to tall, could be comfortably held and poured with one hand, but there are much larger examples. Most Greek oenochoae were in terracotta, but oenochoae of precious metals were not unknown, presumably among elements of society that could afford them, though but few have survived.Silver 'oinochoe' from the \\"Tomb of Philip\\" at Vergina, accessdate=2015-06-24 Large versions in stone were sometimes used as grave markers, often carved with reliefs. In pottery, some oinochoai are \\"plastic\\", with the body formed as sculpture, usually one or more human heads. Prehistoric oenochoae were at first hand-made, unpolished, and undecorated. Low-economy oenochoae remained so, but gradually incised bands with simple motifs such as zig-zags and spirals, or burnished, monochrome surfaces, became common. In the Late Bronze Age the incised bands were painted for a more striking surface, and from then on the Greek oinochoai followed the traditional course of development for Greek decoration. Among the higher- quality pots, quite a few masterpieces have survived.

The alternatives to LTL carriers are parcel carriers or full truckload carriers. Parcel carriers usually handle small packages and freight that can be broken down into units less than . Full truckload carriers move freight that is loaded into a semi-trailer. Semi-trailers are typically between and require a substantial amount of freight to make such transportation economical. LTL carrier operations versus full truckload operations There are several different perspectives as to what is actually considered LTL. Full truck load (FTL) carriers can put anywhere from two to six different shipper's shipments on a trailer and since each shipment is technically \\"less than a truckload\\" they would consider that to be LTL. There are also freight companies who do not specialize in truck loads, but rather, consolidate larger volume shipments from about 2 to 12 pallets (or about 4000 to 24000 pounds) and consider themselves LTL Carriers. Finally, the most commonly referenced LTL is shipped via \\"common\\" carriers who handle freight above what would normally ship via FedEx Ground, or UPS or U.S. Mail parcel services (about 150 pounds) to just under what would usually be considered a Truck Load, at about 20,000 pounds or more than 14 pallets. LTL common carriers are also more likely to accept loose (non-palletized) cargo than the other two. LTL shipments typically weigh between . Less than Truckload carriers use \\"hub and spoke\\" operations where small local terminals are the spokes ('end of line'), and larger more central terminals are the hubs (also called Distribution Centers or DC's). Spoke terminals collect local freight from various shippers and consolidate that freight onto enclosed trailers for transporting to the delivering or hub terminal, where the freight will be further sorted and consolidated for additional transporting (also known as linehauling). In most cases, the end of line terminals employ local drivers who start the day by loading up their trailers and heading out to make deliveries first. When the trailer is empty, they begin making pickups and return to the terminal for sorting and delivery next day. Because of the efficiency of this order of operations, most deliveries are performed in the morning and pickups are made in the afternoon. Pickup and delivery drivers usually have set casual routes which they travel every day or several times a week, so the driver has an opportunity to develop a rapport with their customers. Once the driver has filled their trailer or completed their assigned route, they return to their terminal for unloading. The trailer is unloaded and the individual shipments are then weighed and inspected to verify their conformity to the description contained in the accompanying paperwork. All LTL freight is subject to inspection ('S.T.I.'), though not all freight is inspected. Next, the freight is loaded onto an outbound trailer which will forward the freight to a breakbulk, a connection, or to the delivering terminal. An LTL shipment may be handled only once while in transit, or it may be handled multiple times before final delivery is accomplished. Transit times for LTL freight are longer than for full truckload freight (FTL). LTL transit times are not directly related only to the distance between shipper and consignee. Instead, LTL transit times are also dependent upon the makeup of the network of terminals and breakbulks that are operated by a given carrier and that carrier's beyond agents and interline partners. For example, if a shipment is picked up and delivered by the same freight terminal, or if the freight must be sorted and routed only once while in transit, the freight will likely be delivered on the next business day after pickup. If the freight must be sorted and routed more than once, or if more than one linehaul is required for transportation to the delivering terminal, then the transit time will be longer. In some instances, the LTL freight has up to 10 days of delivery time frame. Also, delivery to beyond points or remote areas will almost always add days to the transit time. The main advantage to using an LTL carrier is that a shipment may be transported for a fraction of the cost of hiring an entire truck and trailer for an exclusive shipment. Also, a number of accessory services are available from LTL carriers, which are not typically offered by FTL carriers. These optional services include liftgate service at pickup or delivery, residential (also known as \\"non-commercial\\") service at pickup or delivery, inside delivery, notification prior to delivery, freeze protection, and others. These services are usually billed at a predetermined flat fee, or for a weight based surcharge calculated as a rate per pound or per hundredweight. =Integrating FTL and LTL carriers for shipper cost savings= Shippers with enough volume of LTL freight may choose to use a full truckload carrier to move the freight directly to a break-bulk facility of an LTL carrier. For example, a North Carolina shipper with a large quantity of shipments bound for Western US States (for example, California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho) may be able to realize significant cost savings by having a FTL carrier, known as a linehaul carrier, transport the freight to a break-bulk facility in a central location near the ultimate destination of the freight (in this example, delivery to a break-bulk facility in California for parceling out into LTL lots for transport to the final destinations). The use of an FTL carrier to transport this freight generally provides an overall cost savings because the freight will travel fewer miles in the FTL carrier's network, as well as a reduced overall fuel surcharge cost—that is, one FTL carrier travels the distance to the break-bulk facility for a single carrier's price while using only the fuel required for that FTL truck, vs. several LTL carriers at each carrier's price, each covering some of the same path to the final destinations and each using the fuel required for each one of the LTL trucks. A further benefit is realized in both loading cost and product damage, because the freight will not need to be unloaded and reloaded as many times. Additionally, this reduces the incidence of loss and the opportunity for pilfering or theft, because all of the freight travels together and is not broken down into LTL loads until it reaches the break-bulk distribution facility. LTL operations versus parcel carrier operationsParcel carrier operations= A parcel carrier traditionally only handles pieces weighing less than approximately . Parcel carriers typically compete with LTL carriers by convincing shippers to break larger shipments down to smaller packages. Parcel carriers typically refer to multipiece shipments as \\"hundredweight\\" shipments as the rating is based on . The hundredweight rate is multiplied by the shipment's weight and then divided by 100 and then rounded up to the nearest hundred. =LTL carrier operation= LTL carriers prefer to handle shipments with the fewest handling units possible. LTL carriers prefer a shipment of 1 pallet containing many boxes shrink wrapped to form one piece rather than many individual pieces. This reduces handling costs and the risk of damage during transit. Typically, the per-pound rates of LTL carriers are less than the per-pound rates of parcel carriers.Lojistic, How to Calculate Less-Than-Truckload LTL Freight Rates =Similarities= Both LTL carriers and XL parcel carriers are similar in the fact that they both use a network of hubs and terminals to deliver freight. Delivery times by both types of service providers are not directly dependent upon the distance between shipper and consignee. Also, using an LTL carrier is very similar to that of using a parcel carrier. The shipper often has a regular, if not daily, pickup schedule and can log onto the carriers homepage to schedule pickups, track shipments, print paperwork, and manage billing information. Preparing shipments for LTL carriers Freight sent via LTL carriers must be handled several times during transit, often by different carriers. It must be packaged to protect it from scuffing, vibration, crushing, dropping, humidity, condensation. Thus, it is normally good practice to load freight onto pallets or package freight into crates. Sturdy shipping containers such as corrugated fiberboard boxes are normally acceptable as well, but pallets are preferred. Carriers have published tariffs that provide some guidance for packaging. Packaging engineers design and test packaging to meet the specific needs of the logistics system and the product being shipped. Proper packaging freight serves several purposes: * It helps protect the freight from handling and transit damage. * It helps protect freight from being damaged by shipper's freight. * It helps reduce package pilferage * It helps to avoid loss situations; situations in which some of customer's freight is separated from the rest and lost in transit. Other considerations: * Type of shipment: pallet, drum, crate, skid, bags, rolls, reels, bales or other. * Size: height width depth. * Weight, each piece and total. * Insurance value coverage, if any. * Liftgate Service requirements, if any * Find the correct National Motor Freight Classification code. * Arrival Notice, if any * Hazardous Materials Notice, if any * Residential Delivery Notice. Since freight sent via LTL carriers is subject to misrouting or misloading, it is a good practice to put the tracking number on each side of each piece of freight. If the destination state and zipcode are affixed to each side as well, misloading is less likely to occur. Even though it is not required, it is good practice to affix a relatively large label including the four letter carrier code, tracking number, destination station, and destination zipcode of the shipment (i.e. ABFS123456789 GA 30301). The easier it is for dockworkers to identify an individual shipment, the less likely it is to be misrouted. The value or type of contents should not be advertised on the package to help reduce loss. If the only piece of identification is the tracking number, the dockworker will have more difficulty identifying the shipment's pieces, hence the chances of freight being loaded onto the wrong trailer are greater, increasing the transit time and increasing the probability of the shipment being lost. Proper labels, bar codes, and RFID are important for proper routing and delivery.  Intermodal transportation of LTL shipping  Not all LTL shipments travel by truck only. LTL carriers rely on rail or air to forward some freight toward its destination. LTL carriers are normally able to deal with railroads more effectively than small shippers since LTL carriers typically send a large volume of freight daily. For example, a significant portion of rail intermodal traffic consists of truck trailers, often dozens in a single intermodal train, carrying LTL freight. LTL carriers are able to monitor railroad performance to ensure delivery of freight within the specified delivery window. An Intermodal freight transport shipment employs several methods of transporting goods from start to finish. For instance, one shipment will start out on the railroad, then be transferred to an ocean carrier, and end up on a truck before delivery. Intermodal shipping is considered advantageous by some shippers because there is no handling of the freight when it changes from one carrier to the next. Pallets are used to consolidate many items into one easy-to-move container. Because handling is reduced, it also reduces damage and loss, increases security, and allows quicker transport.

Glass beads have been dated back to at least Roman times. Perhaps the earliest glass-like beads were Egyptian faience beads, a form of clay bead with a self-forming vitreous coating. Glass beads are significant in archaeology because the presence of glass beads often indicate that there was trade and that the beadmaking technology was being spread. In addition, the composition of the glass beads could be analyzed and help archaeologists understand the sources of the beads.Glover, I. C., & Bellina, B. (2011). Ban Don Ta Phet and Khao Sam Kaeo: The Earliest Indian Contacts Re-assessed. Early Interactions Between South and Southeast Asia: Reflections on Cross-cultural Exchange Common types of glass bead manufacture Glass beads are usually categorized by the method used to manipulate the glass – wound beads, drawn beads, and molded beads. There are composites, such as millefiori beads, where cross-sections of a drawn glass cane are applied to a wound glass core. A very minor industry in blown glass beads also existed in 19th-century Venice and France. =Wound glass beads= Probably the earliest beads of true glass were made by the winding method. Glass at a temperature high enough to make it workable, or \\"ductile\\", is laid down or wound around a steel wire or mandrel coated in a clay slip called \\"bead release\\". The wound bead, while still hot, may be further shaped by manipulating with graphite, wood, stainless steel, brass, tungsten or marble tools and paddles. This process is called marvering, originating from the French word \\"marbrer\\" which translates to \\"marble\\". It can also be pressed into a mold in its molten state. While still hot, or after re-heating, the surface of the bead may be decorated with fine rods of colored glass called stringers creating a type of lampwork bead. =Drawn glass beads= The drawing of glass is also very ancient. Evidence of large-scale drawn-glass beadmaking has been found by archeologists in India, at sites like Arekamedu dating to the 2nd century CE. The small drawn beads made by that industry have been called Indo-Pacific beads, because they may have been the single most widely traded item in history—found from the islands of the Pacific to Great Zimbabwe in southern Africa.Kanungo, A.K. 2004. Glass Beads in Ancient India and Furnace-Wound Beads at Purdalpur: An Ethnoarchaeological Approach. Asian Perspectives 43(1):123–150. There are several methods for making drawn beads, but they all involve pulling a strand out of a gather of glass in such a way as to incorporate a bubble in the center of the strand to serve as the hole in the bead. In Arekamedu this was accomplished by inserting a hollow metal tube into the ball of hot glass and pulling the glass strand out around it, to form a continuous glass tube. In the Venetian bead industry, molten glass was gathered on the end of a tool called a puntile (\\"puntying up\\"), a bubble was incorporated into the center of a gather of molten glass, and a second puntile was attached before stretching the gather with its internal bubble into a long cane. The pulling was a skilled process, and canes were reportedly drawn to lengths up to long. The drawn tube was then chopped, producing individual drawn beads from its slices. The resulting beads were cooked or rolled in hot sand to round the edges without melting the holes closed; were sieved into sizes; and, usually, strung onto hanks for sale. The most common type of modern glass bead is the seed bead, a small type of bead typically less than 6 mm, traditionally monochrome, and manufactured in very large quantities. They are a modern example of mechanically-drawn glass beads. The micro-bead or \\"seed bead\\", are so called due to their tiny, regular size. Modern seed beads are extruded by machine and some, such as Miyuki delicas, look like small tubes. =Molded beads= Pressed glass beads Pressed or molded beads are associated with lower labour costs. These are made in the Czech republic. Thick rods are heated to molten and fed into a complex apparatus that stamps the glass, including a needle that pierces a hole. The beads again are rolled in hot sand to remove flashing and soften seam lines. By making canes (the glass rods fed into the machine) striped or otherwise patterned, the resulting beads can be more elaborately colored than seed beads. One \`feed' of a hot rod might result in 10–20 beads, and a single operator can make thousands in a day. Glass beads are also manufactured or moulded using a rotary machine where molten glass is fed in to the centre of a rotary mould and solid or hollow glass beads are formed. The Bohemian glass industry was known for its ability to copy more expensive beads, and produced molded glass \\"lion's teeth\\", \\"coral\\", and \\"shells\\", which were popular in the 19th and early 20th century Africa trade. =Lampwork beads= dichroic glass bead showing thin film application Furnace glass beads A variant of the wound glass beadmaking technique, and a labor-intensive one, is what is traditionally called lampworking. In the Venetian industry, where very large quantities of beads were produced in the 19th century for the African trade, the core of a decorated bead was produced from molten glass at furnace temperatures, a large-scale industrial process dominated by men. The delicate multicolored decoration was then added by people, mostly women, working at home using an oil lamp or spirit lamp to re-heat the cores and the fine wisps of colored glass used to decorate them. These workers were paid on a piecework basis for the resulting lampwork beads. Modern lampwork beads are made by using a gas torch to heat a rod of glass and spinning the resulting thread around a metal rod covered in bead release. When the base bead has been formed, other colors of glass can be added to the surface to create many designs. After this initial stage of the beadmaking process, the bead can be further fired in a kiln to make it more durable. Modern beadmakers use single or dual fuel torches, so \`flameworked' is replacing the older term. Unlike a metalworking torch, or burner as some people in the trade prefer to call them, a flameworking torch is usually \\"surface mix\\"; that is, the oxygen and fuel (typically propane, though natural gas is also common) is mixed after it comes out of the torch, resulting in a quieter tool and less dirty flame. Also unlike metalworking, the torch is fixed, and the bead and glass move in the flame. American torches are usually mounted at about a 45 degree angle, a result of scientific glassblowing heritage; Japanese torches are recessed, and have flames coming straight up, like a large bunsen burner; Czech production torches tend to be positioned nearly horizontally. =Dichroic glass beads= Increasingly, dichroic glass is being used to produce high-end art beads. Dichroic glass has a thin film of metal fused to the surface of the glass, resulting in a surface that has a metallic sheen that changes between two colors when viewed at different angles. Beads can be pressed, or made with traditional lampworking techniques. If the glass is kept in the flame too long, the metallic coating will turn silver and burn off. =Furnace glass= Italian glass blowing techniques such as latticinio and zanfirico are adapted here to make beads. Furnace glass uses large decorated canes built up out of smaller canes, encased in clear glass and then extruded to form the beads with linear and twisting stripe patterns. No air is blown into the glass. These beads require a large scale glass furnace and annealing kiln for manufacture. =Lead crystal= Lead crystal beads are machine cut and polished. Their high lead content makes them sparkle more than other glass, but also makes them inherently fragile. Other methods Lead glass (for neon signs) and, especially borosilicate is available in tubing, making true blown beads possible. (Soda-lime glass can be blown at the end of a metal tube, or, more commonly wound on the mandrel to make a hollow bead, but the former is unusual and the latter not a true mouth-blown technique.) In addition, beads can be fused from sheet glass or using ground glass. Modern Ghana has an industry in beads molded from powdered glass. Also in Africa, Kiffa beads are made in Mauritania, historically by women, using powdered glass that the beadmaker usually grinds herself from commercially available glass seed beads and recycled glass. Molded ground glass, if painted into the mold, is called pate de verre, and the technique can be used to make beads, though pendants and cabochons are more typical. Lampwork (and other) beads can be painted with glass paints.

History of use The nobori were significant on the battlefields of feudal Japan. The nobori of the time were used to denote units within an army; nobori became much more common in the Sengoku period, in use alongside the earlier hata-jirushi. Though usually used to represent different divisions within an army, nobori were sometimes made identical, so as to produce an impressive and intimidating display of warrior flags. Today nobori are a common sight outside businesses, restaurants, and retail stores where they advertise a sale, a new product, and simply the name of the business. They are used during festivals and sports events; in sports they take the place of the banners and signs common among Western audiences. They are also used to make commercial announcements, appeal for something, and identify a political party during an election campaign. They may also line the walkways, fences or walls of Shinto shrines or Buddhist temples and frequently bear the names of donors or deceased parishioners. In recent years, nobori influenced flags are gaining popularity around the world.

Overview The book is one of four miniseries leading up to DC Comics' Infinite Crisis event. The series directly follows the Countdown to Infinite Crisis special, picking up the story where the special left off. The OMACs mentioned in the title borrow their name and general appearance from the 1974 Jack Kirby creation OMAC. However, the OMACs in this 2005 miniseries differ from the original in other ways, including the term underlying the acronym that forms their name: in Kirby's stories, \\"OMAC\\" stands for \\"One-Man Army Corps\\", while in this miniseries, \\"OMAC\\" stands for \\"Observational Metahuman Activity Construct\\" (constructed backwards from the Kirby acronym as a form of backronym). In the miniseries, OMACs are people scattered across the world who harbor invasive technology in their bodies but do not know it. When activated, the technology can be used to spy on the human hosts' surroundings, control their bodies or transform any of them into one of a visually identical set of remote-controlled superhuman beings. The human hosts of the OMAC technology act as unwitting sleeper agents for former Justice League associate Maxwell Lord. The OMACs are guided by the \\"Brother Eye\\" satellite, as in the original 1974 Kirby stories. In this 2005 miniseries, however, Brother Eye differs from its 1974 inspiration. This miniseries portrays Brother Eye as an artificially intelligent spy satellite originally built by Batman, not to control the OMACs, but to observe the members of the Justice League. Before the beginning of the miniseries, Maxwell Lord has already secretly captured Brother Eye from Batman and turned the satellite toward the end of coordinating the OMACs that Lord now controls. Lord uses the OMACs and Brother Eye to stalk and attack the world's superheroes and supervillains, with the avowed goal of reasserting humanity's control over the world. The OMAC Project ends with an autonomous, intelligent Brother Eye satellite commanding over 200,000 OMACs and seemingly planning war on the world's superheroes, starting with the worldwide broadcast of Maxwell Lord's death at the hands of Wonder Woman. The OMAC Project has numerous tie-ins with other titles, including Action Comics #829; Adventures of Superman #642; Aquaman #35; Birds of Prey #83; Firestorm #18; JSA #76; Hawkman #46; Manhunter #13-14; Robin #143-144; Superman #217-219 and 222; and Wonder Woman #219-221. Series plot summary Blue Beetle is dead, Booster Gold is in the hospital, and the Checkmate organization, led by Maxwell Lord, continues its mysterious operations against DC's superheroes. Booster Gold wakes up and, after learning of Ted Kord's disappearance, decides to investigate with the help of Wonder Woman. OMACs (Observational Meta-human Activity Constructs) have been spotted all over the world and have managed to kill several metahumans. Batman and Wonder Woman investigate the OMACs while Booster, after meeting Guy Gardner in space, decides that he would rather investigate Ted Kord's disappearance with other former members of the Justice League International. Interwoven through this plot are scenes detailing the power struggle within the Checkmate organization itself. Checkmate is led by the White Queen, White King, Black Queen and Black King, each of whom have Knights of corresponding color. Through his machinations, Black King Maxwell Lord becomes the only leader of the organization, despite being double-crossed by one of his own Knights, Sasha Bordeaux. Lord is then killed by Wonder Woman (in the pages of Wonder Woman #219) to prevent him from continuing to direct the actions of a mind-controlled Superman. Brother Eye, the artificial intelligence directing the OMAC drones, initiates a protocol specifically designed to be used in the event of Lord's death and OMAC drones worldwide begin to wreak havoc and destruction. Sasha herself is transformed into an OMAC-like being, powered by nanotechnology. Rocket Red #4, a former member of the Justice League Europe, sacrifices himself in order to destroy several drones and save the lives of his friends. Batman and Sasha then work with the remnants of Checkmate and other government organizations to lure the majority of OMACs to the Sahara Desert. There, as OMACs gather to attack a large number of gathered heroes, Batman activates an EMP device that disables all of the OMACs, allowing their human hosts to be freed. However, the Brother Eye satellite is still hidden and has about 200,000 OMAC's still under its control. Brother Eye overrides all television screens around the world and broadcasts Wonder Woman's killing of Maxwell Lord. People do not understand the circumstances, only that they are watching Wonder Woman murder a recognized Justice League colleague. As the series closes, Brother Eye prepares to launch an all-out war against metahumans to protect humanity. Batman works furiously to disable his rogue creation, while Wonder Woman and the Amazons of Themyscira face international backlash over Diana's brutal means. Brother Eye's campaign against the Amazons leads into Infinite Crisis #1. The OMAC Project: Infinite Crisis Special #1 - \\"The Lazarus Protocol\\" In The OMAC Project: Infinite Crisis Special #1, which takes place after Infinite Crisis #6, Brother Eye has crash-landed in the Rub Al-Khali Desert in southern Saudi Arabia, taking possession of two local sentries. Sasha Bordeaux, returning from the successful attack against Brother Eye in space, is requested by Batman to track down the remains of the satellite (containing information on countless metahumans) and destroy it. Meanwhile, President Jonathan Vincent Horne is being debriefed on the Brother Eye situation by Amanda Waller. Afterwards, he appoints Waller as acting Black King of Checkmate until further notice. In the desert, local forces try to gain control of the downed machinery, but are eliminated by a behemoth OMAC created from the two sentries. In Switzerland, Jessica Midnight is communicating with Mr. Bones, Director of DEO, when she is quickly interrupted and cut off by Amanda Waller (flanked by Fire). Waller demands to know what's currently happening, having Fire put the \\"heat\\" on Midnight as well as announcing herself as Midnight's new superior. While the Israeli, Russian and Chinese governments begin measures to retrieve the satellite, Brother Eye attempts to remote link to Sasha and take control of her body, but it fails. Sasha arrives at a Checkmate safehouse and attempts to make contact with Midnight at headquarters, but is stopped by Waller, who demands to know if Sasha is an OMAC or not. Sasha does not know. Waller demands Sasha to return to base, but Sasha says she will not. Waller then instructs Fire to stop Brother Eye from being reactivated, even if it means killing Sasha or Midnight. When Fire protests such lethal commandments, Waller jabs at her with remarks on what she did for her people in Brazil before gaining her powers and how much she enjoyed it. As all of the factions reach the downed satellite, Sasha rushes through the ensuing battle to detonate explosives from within Brother Eye's CPU chamber. The computer nearly succeeds in downloading its programming and data files over Sasha's mind when she activates the explosives. Searching the wreckage, Fire and Midnight find Sasha alive and free of the nanobots that she was infected with.

Its taxonomy is confused, and it has formerly been placed in Fringilla, Bucanetes, Carduelis and Rhodopechys. It has an average wingspan of . It has a stout black bill, black and white remiges and rectrices, and a slash of rosy-pink on each wing. The female is more dull in color than the male, but other than that the adult sexes are similar in color pattern. The bird is indeed a desert resident in areas where water is readily available, but it can also be found in low mountains and foothills, and in cultivated valleys. It feeds on seeds and the occasional insect. Nesting occurs in trees in the spring, often in fruit trees in orchards, and the female lays and incubates 4 to 6 pale green, lightly speckled eggs. This species does not migrate except locally. The desert finch congregates near rural and remote human settlements, and the well-watered orchard in otherwise arid land is an ideal habitat. It can be found in feeding in large flocks of its own species or mixed finch flocks. Recent research by Zamora et al. (2006) has revealed that the desert finch is more closely related to the greenfinches of the genus Carduelis (or Chloris, if Carduelis is split up) as indicated by DNA sequence analysis, vocalizations, and the presence of a black eye-stripe. Genetically, it seems very close to the common ancestor of the greenfinches. It may be that the latter evolved from a desert form and later developed the green plumage, or that the common ancestor of the greenfinches and the desert finch (which lived around 6 million years ago) was a species of semiarid habitat which subsequently diverged into a truly desert-adapted lineage, today represented by the desert finch, and the ancestor of a woodlands lineage, the greenfinches.  Origin of greenfinches  Eggs of Rhodospiza obsoleta MHNT The common ancestor of all greenfinches, which are among the oldest Carduelis species, appeared on Earth around 9 MYA. One of these common ancestors is the desert finch, which now thrives in Asian deserts, but could have also inhabited African deserts. This finch, with very pale colors and a breeding season mask similar to that of the common greenfinch, used to be classified, according to phenotypical (external) characters, close to the trumpeter finch, but it belongs to genus Carduelis according to several molecular studies. Two subfossil greenfinches, the slender-billed greenfinch, Carduelis aurelioi, and the Trias greenfinch, Carduelis triasi, are known from the Canary Islands. References *Groth, J. G. 1994.

Initially, a series of strong earthquakes shook the area, and wheat fields were rapidly uplifted. Lava broke through the surface and the current peak was created. The peak is now tall, and still actively smoking. The name Shōwa-shinzan means \\"Shōwa new mountain\\", as it formed during the reign of Emperor Hirohito, known as the Shōwa period. When Shōwa-shinzan first appeared, the Japanese authorities were worried that it might be interpreted as an unlucky wartime omen, and its existence was kept secret. Much of the information about peak's formation during these years comes from local postmaster Masao Mimatsu, who kept detailed measurements of its progress. Shōwa-shinzan during its formative year in October 1944 Volcanic activity timeline Generally, the volcanic activity of Shōwa-shinzan can be divided into three main phases as recorded by Masao Mimatsu. =Phase 1, Pre-Eruption Phase (28 December 1943 – 22 June 1944)= On 28 December 1943, earthquakes starting to occur frequently around Mount Usu, with occurrences of more than 200 times per day on some days. The hypocenter in the early days was located in the vicinity of Lake Tōya. As the year entered 1944, the hypocenter started to move toward the eastern part of the base of Mount Usu and this resulted in the protuberance of the overlying ground. Eventually the protuberance started to spread to the north, reaching up to heights of 50 meters in some areas. The Sōbetsu riverbed also started to rise, and many fissures started to appear in the surrounding farmlands. The longest fissure recorded was about 600 meters long. On 22 June 1944, there were about 250 earthquakes in one day, and accordingly the protuberance of the ground rose by 150 centimeters in one day. =Phase 2, Eruption Phase (23 June 1944 – 31 October 1944)= On 23 June 1944 at 0815 hours, smoke started to come out of the fissures and shortly after a huge eruption followed accompanied by a thunderous roar. On 2 July 1944, the eruption became even more vigorous, and a phreatomagmatic eruption occurred. On 7 July 1944, a pyroclastic surge accompanied the eruption. The surge managed to reach the northern bank of Lake Tōya, burning forests and houses in the process. By the end of October 1944, Masao Mimatsu recorded a total of seven craters, seventeen major eruptions and countless minor ones. Furthermore, centimeters of volcanic ash from the eruption had been found deposited up to one kilometer away from the volcano, while the protuberance of the ground continued. From July 1944 to August 1944, the protuberance grew by two meters on some days. =Phase 3, Post Eruption Phase (1 November 1944 – September 1945)= Within this phase all eruption activity stopped completely and a lava dome began to take shape. The lava dome continued to take shape until September 1945, when earthquake activity finally seemed to come to a halt. The birth of Shōwa- shinzan was finally complete. Even so, the volcano continues to emit smoke even until today.

It was founded by Cha Gyeong-seok (1880-1936) on Ibam Mountain in Daeheung-ri, Ibam-myeon, Jeongeup, Jeollabuk- do, in the year 1911. Today this site is part of Naejangsan National Park. Cha Gyeong-seok was originally a Donghak (Cheondoist) priest, who converted to Jeungsanism after meeting Gang Il-Sun. After Gang's death, Goh Pan-Lye (Subu, literally “Head Lady,” 1880–1935, although in Kang's circle there was more than one \\"Subu\\"), a female disciple of Kang Jeungsan, around September 1911 gathered around her a number of Kang's followers. Cha Gyeong-seok was Goh's male cousin and became the leader of Goh's branch. Dissatisfied with this situation, Goh separated from Cha in 1919 and established her own new religion.See Lee Kang-o, “Chungsan-gyo: Its History, Doctrine and Ritual,” Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch 43 (1967): 28-66 Cha continued under the name Bocheon-gyo, which was adopted in 1921, at a great ritual held in Hamyang County, Gyeongsangnam-do.

Bocheonism, however, declined rapidly after Cha's death in 1936, and fragmented into several competing group, as did Goh's organization. The largest among these branches is Jeung San Do. Cha prophesied that the unification of the world would take place beginning in Korea. Branches of Bocheonism are also credited with encouraging local culture in the Jeongeup region, including the pungmulgut performance tradition.

The town is situated on an island south of Port Harcourt, making it a suburb of the much larger city. The average elevation of Okrika is 452 metres. It lies on the north of the Bonny River and on Okrika Island, 35 miles (56 km) upstream from the Bight of Bonny. The town can be reached by vessels of a draft of 29 feet (9 metres) or less. Formerly a fishing village of the Ijo (Ijaw) people in the mangrove swamps of the eastern Niger River delta, Okrika became the capital of the Okrika kingdom in the early 17th century and actively dealt in slaves. It served as a port for the exportation of palm oil after the abolition of the slave trade in the 1830s, but it was a less significant port facility than either Bonny (18 miles [46 km] south) or Opobo (32 miles [81 km] east-southeast). By 1912, Okrika had been completely eclipsed by Port Harcourt, and it was not revived as a commercial port until 1965, when the nearby Port Harcourt refinery was completed and pipelines were built to a jetty on Okrika Mainland. It also has a major gas plant facility (Alakiri gas plant) that supplies to the refinery and others. Refined petroleum products are some of Okrika's significant exports. The town has considerable local trade in fish( which is in rapid decline due to pollution of the waters and land by crude oil activities) oil palm produce, locally processed salt, cassava (manioc), taro, plantains, and yams. The 2006 census determined the population of the Wakirike Local Government Area of the Rivers State of Nigeria was 222,026. An estimated 145,000 Okrika natives live elsewhere around the world, mostly in the United Kingdom and the United States. Socio-cultural Organisation Nine traditional towns constituted the Okrika Kingdom before 1913, these towns are Kirike, Ogoloma, Abuloma, Ogu, Bolo, Ogbogbo, Ibaka, Ele and Isaka. Most of these traditional towns also have satellite villages. Today the constituent towns of Okrika kingdom has increased to ten towns. The additional town is Koniju Town (Koni-ama). Wakrikese is a collective name for Okrika villages even before the British Colonial Government began its colonial expedition. The Koniju section of Kirike was declared Koniju town by a Rivers State high court in 1995. It is now also a constituent town of Okrika Kingdom. The traditional towns that constitutes the Okrika nation has therefore increased from nine towns prior to 1913 to thirteen towns as at 1995. The constituents towns are therefore: Okrika Town (Kirike) - the capital city of Okrika, Ogolome (Ogoloma Town), Abuloma (Obulum/Abulome), Ogu Town, Bolo Town, Ibaka Town, Ogbogbo Town, Ele Town, Isaka Town, Amadi-Ama, Tere-Ama (Ukukalama, Somiari - ama, Fimie Ama), Okuru-Ama, and Koniju Town (Koni-ama).

Kinsmen living together in the same area make up each War-Canoe House. Although the War-Canoe is an institution of kinship, historically, it deals principally with war and defence. War-Canoe houses may be different in terms of size and man power. however, Benefits and community assets are shared to the War-Canoe house equally and not based on their numerical strength. Every War-Canoe House is headed by a Chief who is assisted in various capacities by sub-chiefs. The Chief is addressed as the 'Warinyanabo' or 'Waridabo' showing his status as head of the entire War-Canoe house (Omuaru-wari). Each War-Canoe house also known as Omuaru-wari or Warinyengi is constituted by sub-units known variously as 'Warikubu' or 'Oko'. Each sub-unit (Warikubu or Oko) is headed by a sub- chief known locally as the 'Oko-tibidabo'. Each sub-unit (Warikubu or Oko) is further divided into extended family units known as 'Furo'. Characterised by strong kinship ties, the Furo is composed of grandfathers, parents, uncles, aunts, brothers, sisters, cousins, nephews and nieces. Class System: Within each War-Canoe house, there are four classes for men and three for women. Classes are referred to as 'Mumbu'. Male members of the War-Canoe house apart from the Chief and the King (Amayanabo) are classed into 'Opu Mumbu' (first class), 'Ogbobiri Mumbu' (second Class), 'Kala Mumbu' (third class) and 'Owuapu-awo' (teenagers below 18 years of age). Similarly, females members of a War-Canoe house are classed into the 'Opu Mumbu' (first class), 'Kala Mumbu' (second class) and 'Iria-Soka Awo' (Maidens). The class system is an ordinary ranking system, however it ensures hard work and progress within the War-Canoe House. Ranking is usually based on age and achievements. However, the main factors that determines promotion to a given class may vary between War-Canoe Houses. As opposed to a Caste system, classes are not heritable nor transferable. Therefore, no member of the War-Canoe house is born into a class. Members higher up the class have a greater share of the benefits and financial burdens of the War-Canoe House but decision making within the War- Canoe house is democratic. Language The languages spoken by the Okrika people is Kirikeni Okwen Okrika languageOkrika]. The local Kirike language is part of the ljoid group. Religion Historically, the Okrika people of old were polytheist believing in several gods and deities. Others where animist who believed in many spirits including marine spirits and in the spirits of their ancestors. Finibeso was considered the chief god of the ancient Okrika people and his priest where most reverend among other priests. The Fenibeso shrine was most sacred and divine. Traditionally, no restrictions were imposed on the worship of any god, for there has always been a freedom of worship in Okrika.

Also the Okrika kingdom aquatic life suffers greater threat of species extinction due to the continuous spill of oil mostly caused by bunkery and pipeline vandalism in the region and this results to poor economic sustainability as a large number of residents and indigenes are Fishermen The aquatic life suffers firstly from the emanation of oil waste product that comes from the refinery. It has been on a continuous spill that goes straight into the river and it has been spilling long before there were any bunkery or oil vandalism.

Mount Eden Prisons consists of two separate facilities in the Auckland, New Zealand suburb of Mount Eden — the Mount Eden Prison and the Mount Eden Corrections Facility.

The Prisons have been the site of several protests. Pictured is a protest which took place in October 2007 over recent police raids. In June 2007 it was announced that a new six-storey prison building and a four-storey accommodation block would be built on the southern side of the building by 2011, adding 450 beds. The Auckland Central Remand Facility was then amalgamated into a new Mt Eden Correctional Facility. The plan was for the old prison to be converted to administrative space, in accordance with its heritage classification. To date it has not happened and lays dormant. The redevelopment included a secure gatehouse, a visitor centre and a multilevel carpark added to the structure. Tunnels link the different sections. The barbed wire around the complex disappeared and was replaced by high and secure walls. There was some criticism of the proposed height of the new prison building, which at up to is visible from the nearby motorway viaduct and towers over the surrounding area, which has a building height limit.

Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna (not to be confused with her cousin, Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolayevna, second daughter of Nicholas II, 1897-1918), had six brothers and two sisters, one which died at the age of two months. Title On 14 July 1886, Emperor Alexander III of Russia modified the Romanov house laws by restricting the title of Grand Duke/Duchess to children and grandchildren in the male line of a Russian emperor. More distant agnatic descendants would henceforth bear the title of \\"Prince(ess) of the Blood Imperial\\". Thus, Tatiana, being a great- granddaughter of Nicholas I of the so-called \\"Konstantinovich\\" branch of the Romanovs was only a princess from birth, entitled to the style of Highness, as opposed to Imperial Highness.  Early life  Tatiana Konstantinovna was born on 23 January 1890. She was the first daughter of Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich and Grand Duchess Elizaveta Mavrikievna. At the time it was not usual for a member of the Romanov family to have many daughters, so she was gladly accepted. Her name, Tatiana, was the idea of her grandfather, and was taken from the character Tatiana Larina from Alexander Pushkin's novel Eugene Onegin. She was close friends with Tsar Nicholas II's two eldest daughters, Olga and Tatiana Nikolaevna, and was mentioned frequently in both their diaries. As a child she was described as a \\"quiet girl\\", and was reported to have a talent for the piano, something she got from her father, the Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich. Tatiana made her first official court appearance on 11 August (24 August New Style) 1904, for the celebration of the christening of her cousin Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich, who was to be baptised in the Church at the Palace of Peterhof. It was the first time she appeared in full Russian court dress. Earlier that morning, she left the Palace of Strelna, which was nearby, in a string of carriages, which went along the Finnish Gulf before reaching the Emperor's estate. She was said to be wearing \\"long white gloves\\" with \\"a string of her mother's pearls around her neck, and a satin kokoshnik with a large bow atop her hair.\\" Tatiana Konstantinovna in official Russian court dress. Circa August 11th/24th 1904 When she was young she enjoyed the company of animals. Once her brother Gavrill gave her a pink cockatoo, which he had been trying to teach to speak, but to no avail. Tatiana was playing with it when the bird suddenly turned on her, cutting her with its beak across her forehead. Although the cut was harmless, the scar remained the rest of her life. When she was nineteen years old, in the spring of 1909, Tatiana put on a play with the rest of her siblings in honor of the 25th anniversary of their parents' wedding. It was titled: \\"The Wedding of Sun and Spring\\", with Tatiana in the role of Spring. That year she also participated in an activity with her family where they recreated the famous portrait of Emperor Paul I's family. Terms of marriage In early 1911, Tatiana was rumored to be marrying Prince Alexander of Serbia (later Alexander I of Yugoslavia), but nothing came of this; Alexander later married Princess Maria of Romania. In the spring of 1911, Tatiana Konstantinovna became engaged to Prince Constantine Bagration of Mukhrani (2 March 1889, Tbilisi, - 19 May 1915, Jarosław), a Georgian by birth who was serving in a Russian Imperial Guards regiment, and died in World War I. She was to be the first daughter of the Romanovs to openly marry a Russian subject or non-dynastic prince since the dynasty ascended the throne in 1613. Legally Tatiana Konstantinovna's marriage was morganatic. Her father did not approve of the match, and initially sent Tatiana away to the Crimea to visit her relative Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna. It was there that KR found his daughter with Konstantin, and gave his blessing. Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna and her husband Prince Konstantin Bagration-Mukhransky. It was, in fact, the first marriage in the dynasty conducted in compliance with the Emperor's formal decision not to accept as dynastic the marriages of even the most junior Romanovs--those that bore only the title of prince/princess--with non-royal partners. According to \\"Always A Grand Duke\\", the 1933 memoir of Nicholas II's brother-in-law, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia (published in New York, by Farrar and Rinehart, Inc.), concern about the eventual marriages of cadet Romanovs so troubled the senior grand dukes that Alexander approached the Emperor about relaxing the requirement that dynasts marry partners \\"possessing corresponding rank\\" enshrined in article 188 of the Fundamental Laws (the so-called \\"Pauline Laws\\"), but was rebuffed. The grand dukes officially petitioned the Emperor through a commission chaired by Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolayevich of Russia, requesting that a new category of dynastic marriages be recognized, to consist of Imperial princes and princesses entitled, with specific Imperial consent, to marry persons of non- royal blood and to transmit to the issue thereof eligibility to inherit the throne. The Emperor's response was issued formally on 14 June 1911 in the form of a memorandum from the Imperial court minister, Baron Vladimir Frederiks (State Archives of the Russian Federation, Series 601, {\\"The Emperor Nicholas II\\"}, Inventory {register} 1, File 2143, pages 58–59): > The Lord Emperor has seen fit to permit marriages to persons not possessing > corresponding rank of not all Members of the Imperial Family, but only of > Princes and Princesses of the Blood Imperial...Princes as well as Princesses > of the Blood Imperial, upon contracting a marriage with a person not > possessing corresponding rank, shall personally retain the title and > privileges which are theirs by birth, with the exception of their right to > succession from which they shall have abdicated before entering the > marriage. In relation to the categorization of the marriages of Princes and > Princesses of the Blood Imperial, the Lord Emperor has seen fit to recognize > only two categories in these marriages: (a) equal marriages, i.e. those > contracted with persons belonging to a Royal or Ruling House, and (b) > unequal marriages, i.e. those contracted with persons not belonging to a > Royal or Ruling House, and will not recognize any other categories. As promised in this communiqué, the Emperor proceeded to legalize authorized marriages of imperial Romanovs below grand ducal rank to persons who lacked \\"corresponding rank\\". Such marriages had been altogether banned, rather than deemed morganatic, by Alexander III's ukase #5868 on 23 March 1889. But ukase #35731/1489, issued on 11 August 1911, amended the 1889 ban with the words, \\"Henceforth no grand duke or grand duchess may contract a marriage with a person not possessing corresponding rank, that is, not belonging to a Royal or Ruling house.\\" Both the 1889 and 1911 decrees were addenda to article 188 of the Pauline laws (re-codified as article 63 of the Imperial Family Statute). Left intact, however, was that original statute: \\"A person of the Imperial family who has entered into a marriage alliance with a person not possessing corresponding rank, that is, not belonging to a Royal or Ruling House, cannot pass on to that person, or to any posterity that may issue from such a marriage, the rights which belong to the Members of the Imperial family.\\" Also remaining unrepealed was article 36 (\\"Children born of a marriage between a member of the Imperial Family and a person not of corresponding rank, that is, not belonging to a Royal or Ruling House, shall have no right of succession to the Throne\\"). Aside from article 188, article 36 applied to prevent Tatiana Konstantinovna's issue from claiming succession rights. Her contemplated marriage having been rendered legal, Tatiana Konstantinovna renounced her dynastic rights, as required. Nicholas II acknowledged this in a ukase addressed to the Imperial Senate on 9 February 1914 (Collection of Statutes and Decrees of the Government, 1914, #441): \\"Her Highness the Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna has presented to Us over Her own sign manual, a renunciation of the right to succession to the Imperial Throne of All the Russias belonging to Her as a member of the Imperial House,\\" receiving in return Nicholas II's authorization to marry Bagration-Mukhransky. Finally, Tatiana Konstantinovna and her Georgian prince were married, at her father's estate at Pavlovsk, on 3 September 1911. The Emperor was present at the wedding and, according to a family tradition subsequently repeated by the bride's son, Nicholas II is reported to have suggested that the bridegroom sign the wedding register as \\"Prince Gruzinsky\\", perhaps a courteous acknowledgement of the fact that, although for the preceding century the Bagrations might only rank as nobles who bore the fairly common title of Knyaz (prince) in Russia, historically the Mukhranskys were a branch of a deposed royal dynasty that had ruled on both sides of the Caucasus for hundreds of years longer than the Romanovs. By changing the law, granting unprecedented permission for the marriage, and personally attending it, Nicholas II was not, in fact, treating this marriage as an act of rebellion, nor as a disgrace to the Romanovs. Yet his acceptance was conditioned upon the marriage being deemed legally morganatic, reflecting the non-dynastic status that the Bagration-Mukhranskys held in Russia in 1911. On the same day, the Emperor issued yet another ukase, (#35766): \\"By Our and Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich’s and Grand Duchess Elizaveta Mavrikievna’s consent, the wedding took place on 24th day of this August [old style] of the Daughter of Their Imperial Highnesses, Her Highness the Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna, with Prince Konstantin Bagration-Mukhransky. In consequence of this order: The Princess Tatiana Konstantiovna to retain the title of Highness and henceforth to bear the name of Her Highness the Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna Princess Bagration-Mukhransky...\\" Adult life Princess Natalia Bagrationi-Mukhransky, daughter of Tatiana. During the summer of 1914 Tatiana participated in the ceremonies to welcome the President of France to Russia. When she was twenty-five years old, on April 18, 1915 (Old Style) Tatiana was driving a charabanc by herself, when it crashed. According to a letter Olga Nikolaevna wrote to her father: \\"During the day yesterday Tatiana Konstantinovna was driving the charabanc by herself. She hit something, turned over, and now is in bed with torn ligaments.\\" Tatiana and Prince Constantine Bagration of Mukhrani had two children: *Teymuraz Bagration (1912-1992) *Natasha Bagration (1914-1984) After the outbreak of World War I, Konstantin enlisted in Russia's armed forces, and was killed in action in 1915. She became close to Elisabeth Feodorovna at the time, and refused to wear black at her husband's funeral. She moved with her brother Igor to the Caucasus after praying on Kostantin's funeral, she received the blessing of her father for the last time as she left. Just two days after the funeral of her husband her father died. Her brother Oleg was wounded in action, and subsequently died on 29 September 1914 at Vitebsk Hospital in Vilno. Three other brothers, Ioann, Konstantin and Igor, were murdered by Bolsheviks in 1918. Tatiana Konstantinovna is reported to have become especially close to her uncle, Grand Duke Dmitri Konstantinovich during her widowhood. After the February Revolution, she stayed with him in his palace, where she fell in love with his aide-de-camp, Alexander Korochenzov (17 August 1877 - 6 February 1922). Urged by her uncle, after they were ordered back to Petersburg from previous exile, she left Russia with Korochenzov and her young children. They were fortunate enough to escape, as Dmitri Konstantinovich was executed in St. Petersburg in January 1919. Tatiana Konstantinovna and Korochenzov at first fled to Romania and later to Switzerland. Tatiana reunited with her mother and sister, Vera Konstantinovna, and brother, Georgy Konstantinovich, along with her children, in Brussels in 1921. In November 1921, she married Korochenzov in Geneva. Not quite three months later, however, Tatiana became a widow for the second time when Alexander died in Lausanne. Tatiana raised her children alone, giving them the best education she possibly could, and, after both were grown and married, she took the veil, in Switzerland in 1946, just after the end of the second World War, which was her father's dream. Whenever going to Geneva she stayed at the house of Konstantin Bargration's niece, Tatiana. At first she served at St. Mary Magdalene Convent in Jerusalem, coincidentally where relics of Elisabeth Feodorovna were moved. She later served as Abbess at the Mount of Olives Convent in Jerusalem, and died as Mother Tamara (named so after the medieval Georgian queen Tamar, a remote ancestor of Tatiana's first husband), Пчелов, Евгений Владимирович (Pchyolov, Evgeny Vladimirovich) (2003), Монархи России (\\"Monarchs of Russia\\"), p. 620. Olma Media Group, . on 28 August 1979. Marriage's Implications for Succession Claims In post- monarchy debates over which pretender has the strongest claim to Russia's throne under the dynastic laws, the marriage of Tatiana Konstantinovna is often cited in support of rival claimants. Some cite it as evidence that marriage to a member of the Bagration family cannot be considered any more \\"equal\\" than marriage to any other prince of Russia's nobility, since the marriage was morganatic and she was only able to obtain the Emperor's approval by first renouncing her succession rights. According to this argument, Maria Vladimirovna Romanov and her son, George Mikhailovich, cannot be rightful claimants to the throne because Maria Vladimirovna's mother is Princess Leonida Bagration-Mukhransky, belonging to the same family previously banned from marriage with the Romanovs on equal terms. An oft-heard rebuttal is that the Bagrations fall into the same \\"grey area\\" as the 1856 marriage of Grand Duchess Maria Nikolayevna to Duke Maximilian of Leuchtenberg, who was not a member of a \\"royal or ruling family\\", despite his historical dynastic connections, yet Emperor Nicholas I exercised Imperial authority to rule in favor of Duke Maximilien's dynasticity for marital purposes. Other monarchists argue that the circumstances of Tatiana Konstantinovna's marriage confirm Maria Vladimirovna's claim on two counts. First, they maintain that Nicholas II's acceptance of Tatiana Konstantinovna's renunciation prior to marriage explicitly confirms that she had succession rights despite being born of a Lutheran mother who never converted to the Russian Orthodox Church, which is a prerequisite for successors to Russia's throne. A rebuttal is that article 185 of the Pauline laws is explicit: \\"The marriage of a male member of the Imperial House who might succeed to the Throne to a person of another faith may not take place until she embraces Orthodoxy.\\" The second relevant claim in support of Maria Vladimirovna is that Tatiana Konstantinovna's mandated renunciation proves that Romanov princes were required to marry \\"equally\\" in order to transmit succession rights to their descendants, an interpretation denied by Nicholas Romanovich Romanoff, former president of the Romanoff Family Association, in an interview with the royalty magazine, Point de Vue, published 14 February 1991, who stated, \\"Let’s take the example of the Princess Tatiana who, in 1911, married a prince of a very great family of Georgia, but which was not reigning. Before giving his authorization, Czar Nicholas requested that the princess renounce her rights of succession in advance. That argument is very important since, although her mother was Lutheran, the princess only renounced upon her marriage, whereas there was a law stating that children born of a non-Orthodox marriage had no right to succeed as czar. Nonetheless, Nicholas II requested her renunciation.\\" The counter-claim has been that the wording of the August 1911 ukase restricting the ban on morganatic marriages to grand dukes was silent on imperial princes, therefore the Frederiks memorandum was not given full legal effect.

He is the author of two memoirs, one of which, Not as a Duty Only: an Infantryman's War is widely considered to be a classic in Australian war writing. Early life He was born in Britain to Australian-born parents Henry Gullett and his wife Elizabeth Penelope née Frater. His father was working in London at the time as a journalist.A. J. Hill, “Gullett, Sir Henry Somer (Harry) (1878-1940), Australian Dictionary of Biography, accessed 7 April 2019 He and his mother returned to Australia in 1919, his father being delayed in London.Henry “Jo” Gullett (1992) , Good company: horseman, soldier, politician, Brisbane, University of Queensland Press, p.1. His father soon joined them and for the next four years they lived in a succession of rented houses and Toorak and South Yarra in Melbourne. He was educated at Melbourne Grammar School till 1929 when the family, which by now included a daughter, moved to Canberra. He was then sent to Geelong Grammar as a boarder to complete his secondary education. Gullett spent some of his early childhood in Canberra, at Hill Station (which much later became an upmarket restaurant) in what is now the industrial suburb of Hume. The plains of the Tuggeranong Valley allowed him to develop a passion for horseriding, and he became a keen horseman. After leaving Geelong Grammar he spent a year at the Sorbonne and then commenced at Oxford, where took a BA degree. In 1935 he began work as a journalist in Melbourne at The Herald newspaper, where he stayed for the next four years. War service He enlisted in the Army upon the outbreak of war in 1939, as a private. Much of his service was with the 2/6th Australian Infantry Battalion of the 6th Division of the Australian Imperial Force. As a Sergeant, he was seriously wounded in the Battle of Bardia on 3 January 1941. He is the central character in an Ivor Hele painting of the battle which has hung in the Australian War Memorial since the 1960s. Upon recovery from his wounds, he returned to his Battalion as a Lieutenant for the disastrous Greek campaign, and then travelled with the Battalion to New Guinea. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1943, for his \\"disregard of danger and [for] leadership\\" as a Captain and Company commander at Wau\\". For a time thereafter he was attached to Australian Headquarters in London. As a supernumerary officer with the 8th Battalion Royal Scots, he became the first Australian-born soldier to land on the beach during the Invasion of Normandy on D-Day.http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RB/2006-07/07rb10.pdf Retrieved on 13 October 2007 Due to the very high officer casualty rate, he was soon appointed as a company commander with the Royal Scots, and served in this role until he was further wounded in July 1944. After recovery from his latest wounds, he returned to Australia and attempted to rejoin the 2/6th in New Guinea, but was thwarted by higher command, who ordered that he be restrained – by force if necessary – from embarking. Accordingly, he saw no further action and was demobilised from the Army with the rank of Major at the end of the war. Over 30 years later he wrote a personal account of his war experiences entitled Not As a Duty Only, which has been on the reading lists of several Australian military higher training institutions for many years. He married Ruth Mary Colman in Melbourne in 1945 and the couple had 4 children.The Canberra Times, 9 April 1995, p.3. Political and diplomatic career Gullett in 1946 He first stood for parliament, while still in uniform, in 1943, for his father's old seat of Henty, but was unsuccessful. Prime Minister Robert Menzies, in a confidential report to his colleagues about the defeat of his party in the election, laid out what he saw as the reasons for the loss. Among these was his belief that, In 1946 he stood as a Liberal Party candidate at a by-election for his father's of old seat of Henty, and this time was elected. After the Liberal-led coalition gained power at the 1949 general election, he was appointed Chief Government Whip. He was a fierce anti-communist, and in the early 1950s was a spearhead of Parliamentary moves against Communists and Communist sympathisers within the Public Service and the wider community. His attacks are considered by some to have descended to the level of smear. For example, he described the contribution to foreign relations of John Burton, the former Permanent Secretary of the Department of External Affairs as being 'almost wholly evil'. As a further example, in 1952 he attacked certain academics at the Australian National University on the floor of Parliament and claimed that the University was 'more famous for its left wing politics than for its research'. He also held a strong anti- immigration stance and made public comments, in the press and on the floor of Parliament, that would now be considered as anti-semitism. In the Melbourne Argus of 12 February 1947, he wrote: :The arrival of additional Jews is nothing less than the beginning of a national tragedy and a piece of the grossest deception of Parliament and the people by the Minister for Immigration. http://www.api- network.com/main/index.php?apply=scholars&webpage;=default&flexedit;=&flex;_password=&menu;_label=&menuID;=73&menubox;=&scholar;=91 Retrieved on 14 October 2007 Further, at a press conference in the same month, he said of Jews: :We should remember that they are European neither by race standards, nor culture. They are, in fact, an Eastern people. In 2000 years no one but Britain has been successfully able to absorb them, and for the most, they owe loyalty and allegiance to none. Menzies has been criticised for his preference for older men of his own generation in his cabinet. Gullett is often mentioned as one of the younger men of ability who were too long denied promotion to cabinet or outer-cabinet positions.Bramston, p.154 He retired from the Parliament on 4 November 1955 and returned to journalism. In 1965 he was appointed Australian Ambassador to Greece, and served there until 1968. After politics Gullett had a long association with Canberra – he spent some of his youth there, and in married life, he took up the lease on Lambrigg station in 1949, the ACT rural property which had earlier been home to William Farrer during the time when he developed an important strain of rust-resistant wheat. In the 1970s, he was a member of the Australian War Memorial Council, and served as its chairman between April and August 1974. He is featured in the Memorial's Fifty Australians exhibition. Gullett was the author of two volumes of memoirs, Not As a Duty Only (1976), which covered his war service, and Good Company: Horseman, Soldier, Politician (1992), which is a more complete autobiography. The couple left Lambrigg in 1987 and moved to the Canberra suburb of Griffith. Ruth Mary Gullett died in Griffith on 6 April 1995, aged 73.The Canberra Times, 9 April 1995, p.3 Jo Gullett died on 24 August 1999, aged 84.Phillip Jones, “Ardent man of words, deeds,” (obituary) The Australian, 6 September 1999, p.6.

It is characterised by greensand topography, woodland and heath, which was a common on the Money-Coutts estate centred at Stodham House, Liss. The name of this common land is in fact \\"Farther Commons\\" which can be verified by reference to the ordnance survey map of the area. The Money-Coutts family were part of the famous banking family, owners of Coutts & Co, London. Stodham House was used as a headquarters of the Special Operations Executive during the World War II, the centre of British Intelligence Operations in Nazi Occupied Europe. The plots of development land were sold off in parcels in the early part of the last century, served by two lanes which remain in use. Some of the plots are on steep parts of the greensand ridge. The original houses on both the north and south lanes of the Common were cedar houses, often now much altered. Other plots were sold off in parcels of an acre of more from the earlier plots and houses have been built in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Farther Common is bounded to the East by Bones Bottom, to the West by Gravel Pit Bottom to the North by Stodham Lane and to the South by the North track. The former Woodley House, (the gardeners cottage of Grey Walls House) and West Gables, the former servants quarters of the same property are not properly part of the Common, although now separated from their master house.

He first appeared in Burglars Can't Be Choosers, published in 1977; as of 2013, he has appeared in eleven novels by Block, as well as four short stories (Like a Thief in the Night, The Burglar Who Dropped In On Elvis, The Burglar Who Smelled Smoke and \\"A Bad Night for Burglars\\"). Characters Bernie Rhodenbarr is a New York City-based thief who excels in lock picking and breaking and entering, and who is addicted to the thrill it provides. He served time in prison in his youth, and since then has resolved to avoid getting caught again. Bernie's burglary operations are usually well- planned and tidily executed, from the initial surveillance of the target site to the escape route afterwards. However, during the course of some of these burglaries Bernie encounters a dead body, usually just before the police arrive to investigate a called-in murder. Thus begins the plotline of a typical Bernie Rhodenbarr novel, in which Bernie undertakes to solve the murder in order to clear his name. His investigative techniques include not only interviewing the victim's associates, but visits (sometimes involving illegal entry) to their homes to identify (and occasionally plant) evidence. Beginning with The Burglar Who Liked to Quote Kipling, Bernie has become the owner / operator of Barnegat Books, a used bookstore in Greenwich Village that he purchased from its retiring owner and partially funds through the take from his occasional burglary activities. Prior to the novel The Burglar Who Traded Ted Williams (to explain a publishing hiatus in the series) it was revealed that the bookstore was actually making a profit, before its building's landlord changed and the new owner raised the rent catastrophically. Bernie has since managed to buy the building, and now uses his burglary take to pay for the building's upkeep. The bookstore also houses a cat, a gift from Bernie's friend Carolyn, whom Bernie named Raffles after the fictional gentleman thief. According to Lawrence Block, one of the reasons Bernie operates the bookstore was to meet girls. Bernie enjoys an active sex life, sleeping with at least one female character per novel. Bernie does not appear to have a steady girlfriend. He has also developed a connoisseur's liking for Scotch whisky, particularly single malts. However, if he has a heist planned he will drink no alcohol in the hours prior to its execution, preferring Perrier instead. Friends and associates Carolyn Kaiser is Bernie's best friend, occasional partner in crime, and lesbian soulmate. She operates a pet- grooming salon called The Poodle Factory near Bernie's bookstore. The two meet over drinks on a regular basis, discussing their work and love lives; their conversations enable writer Block to display his wit and weakness for puns and authors. Carolyn has a set of keys to Bernie's apartment and bookstore in case of an emergency. Ray Kirschmann is a plainclothes detective on the New York police force, and is described by Bernie as \\"the best cop money can buy,\\" since Ray will allow himself to be bribed to overlook Bernie's occasional illegal activities. However, Ray does draw the line at homicide, and is usually present at the climax of each novel when the murderer is finally revealed. A married, middle-aged man, Ray's appearance is normally rumpled (despite having expensive clothes) and he tends to talk in a less-educated manner than Bernie. He and Carolyn are not friendly. Wally Hemphill is Bernie's lawyer. The two initially met as jogging enthusiasts when Bernie took up the activity, and Bernie called him to bail him out of prison when he'd learned his previous lawyer had died. Wally has helped Bernie by negotiating the sale of the Barnegat Books building to him, and has also taken up martial arts, which came in handy in a later novel when he apprehended an escaping suspect. Marty Gilmartin is a wealthy businessman and theatre patron who met Bernie shortly after the latter attempted to burgle his home. He occasionally helps Bernie out by identifying potential victims for him, usually rich people with a cash flow problem who would like to collect on their home insurance policy by reporting a burglary.

Block was displeased by the adaptation (he describes watching an in- flight movie, with no sound, and not recognising it as being based on his novel until the credits rolled), and has written the subsequent novels in such a way as to render them unfilmable. In a special movie tie-in edition of the novel, Block added a short intro in which Bernie explained that he has a cousin named Bernice who is also a thief, giving a whimsical \\"in-continuity\\" explanation of the changes to the character.

It is light brown overall, with a whitish mid-belly, a black cap and a pinkish pattern on the wings and tail. The female is slightly duller than the male. This species lives on rocky mountainsides, often at high elevation. It can be found in barren landscapes with little vegetation, and sometimes nests in rock crevices. It feeds on seeds, and during the winter descends in flocks to agricultural fields to find food. The female lays and incubates 4 or 5 blue, lightly speckled eggs. Morphology Asian crimson-winged finch in Almaty, Kazakhstan =Differences between African and Asian birds= There are several differences between Asian crimson-winged finches and African birds: * African birds have a rosy-tinged grey-white central chin and throat, with a narrow brown breast-band below it, whereas this whole area is solidly tawny-brown on Asian birds. * The brown breast and flank markings on Asian birds are more extensive than on African birds. * African birds have less black on the crown than Asian birds (on males it often tends to be restricted to the forecrown). Male birds show the following additional differences: * Asian birds have extensive pink in their uppertail-coverts, which is lacking in African birds (although the latter can show a vinous wash here in fresh plumage). * Asian birds often have black spotting on their breast-sides; African birds always lack this. * Asian birds can have distinct black markings on their mantle, but these are much less distinct on African birds. * Asian birds have on average more distinct black markings on their ear-coverts than African birds. * Asian birds typically have more extensive red in their face, often in the fore- supercilium (African birds can show red here but it is not the norm).

The lake drains into the Exploits River which flows through the interior of Newfoundland and exits into the Atlantic Ocean through the Bay of Exploits. Lloyds River, the Victoria River and Star River feed into the lake. History The Beothuk, also known as 'Red Indians,' inhabited several campsites on the shore of the lake. An expedition into the interior by John Cartwright and brother George Cartwright in search of the Beothuk found only abandoned campsites. At the time of their discovery of the lake they named it Lieutenant's Lake and they had assumed that the lake was part of the same system as Lake Mickmack, known today as Grand Lake. In January 1811, an expedition led by David Buchan travelled up the Exploits River in an attempt to establish friendly relations with the Beothuk; Buchan found them, but the encounter went badly and resulted in the deaths of two marines. John Peyton Jr. led another expedition to the lake in 1819 which also ended in tragedy, resulting in the death of the Beothuk headman Nonosbawsut and the capture of Demasduwit.Marshall (1996), pp. 162-167. Economy and resources The interior of Newfoundland became accessible on the completion of the Newfoundland Railway, and the forest surrounding the lake attracted attention. The lake was surveyed in 1899 by Alex McCombie and by 1901 Lewis Miller had set up a logging operation on the shore near the site of Demasduwit's capture. A railway branch line to the town of Millertown was constructed, and in 1905 the Anglo-Newfoundland Development (AND) Company acquired a 99-year lease on timber and mineral rights for the land surrounding the lake. Prospectors for the AND Company also discovered a substantial deposit of base metals on the north shore of the lake, and in 1926 the town of Buchans was established. Mining operations began the following year. Hydro A pulp and paper mill was constructed at Grand Falls, further downstream on the Exploits River. The mouth of Red Indian Lake was dammed, creating a vast storage reservoir for a hydroelectric generating plant at the mill in Grand Falls. FootnotesReferences *Marshall, Ingeborg (1996).

Vic Berry's Scrapyard was a large railway scrapyard situated in the former Great Central Railway Braunstone Gate goods yard in Leicester. Operations Vic Berry established his Leicester scrapyard in 1973 on the site of what had been the former GC Braunstone Gate goods yard, just south of Leicester Central (GC) Station.http://www.derbysulzers.com/vicberry.html Like Woodham Brothers at Barry, Vic Berry focused initially on breaking up redundant passenger coaches and goods wagons. The first locomotives did not arrive until 10 years later in April 1983 when three BR Class 76 electric locomotives arrived for breaking up. The yard is best known for scrapping large quantities of Class 25 and Class 27 diesel-electric locomotives. This led to the famous 'stack' of Class 25 and 27 locomotives which reached its peak in 1987 with 30 examples stacked. The yard did not exclusively deal with these locomotives, as examples of classes 02, 03, 08, 20, 26, 31, 33, 37, 40, 45, 47, 50, 82, 83, 84, and 85 were scrapped on site, along with a large quantity of BR DMUs. Vic Berry also scrapped a London Underground train and ex-CIE 201 Class locomotives 208 and 219 in 1990. Vic Berry also specialised in asbestos removal as well as scrapping withdrawn locomotives and rolling stock. This was of value to railway preservation societies, who sometimes would benefit from purchasing a locomotive from Vic Berry as it would have already been stripped of asbestos. As the scrapyard was connected to the Leicester to Burton upon Trent Line, the yard contained a large number of locomotives, coaches, wagons and DMUs which were held for either purchase or scrapping. The yard moved from scrapping locomotives to DMUs and rolling stock in December 1990 when what was believed to be the last complete locomotive in the yard, 25213, was scrapped.http://www.derbysulzers.com/vicberry.html Another 18 class 25s were broken up by Vic Berry at other sites; five were broken up off-site while the other 13 were also broken up off-site but with their cabs subsequently transported to Leceister. Fire and closure In the early hours of Sunday 10 March 1991, a serious fire broke out in the scrapyard which took firefighters several hours to bring under control, by which time serious damage had been caused. The cause of the fire, which led to widespread distribution of airborne asbestos across the city, has never been determined. As a result of the fire and after months of difficulties, the Vic Berry Company ceased trading in June 1991, the final straw being the failure to reach a deal with its landlord, British Rail, for the decontamination of 170 grounded bodies in the Western Boulevard which contained asbestos. The company owed creditors a reported £4 million. On 7 June, British Rail gave Vic Berry five days to begin clearing the site or it would bring in a contractor to do so. Vic Berry began to trade under his own name from 11 June 1991, employing around a dozen of his former staff, and began to clear the site on 14 June. The closed site was nevertheless left significantly contaminated from the disposal process. Redevelopment The site was re-developed as a part of the Leicester City Challenge project in 1996 / 1997 as Bede Island.

The Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant is a sewage treatment plant in southwest Los Angeles, California, next to Dockweiler State Beach on Santa Monica Bay. The plant is the largest sewage treatment facility in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area and one of the largest plants in the world. Hyperion is operated by the City of Los Angeles, Department of Public Works, and the Bureau of Sanitation. Hyperion is the largest sewage plant by volume west of the Mississippi River. Los Angeles City Sanitation (LASAN) operates the largest wastewater collection system in the US, serving a population of four million within a service area. The city's more than of public sewers convey 400 million gallons per day of flow from customers to its four plants. History Until 1925, raw sewage from Los Angeles was discharged untreated directly into Santa Monica Bay in the region of today's Hyperion Treatment Plant. With the population increase, the amount of sewage became a major problem to the beaches, so in 1925 the city built a simple screening plant in the it had acquired in 1892. Even with the screening plant, the quality of the water in Santa Monica Bay was unacceptable, and in 1950 Los Angeles opened the Hyperion Treatment Plant with full secondary treatment processes. In addition, the new plant included capture of biogas from anaerobic digesters to produce heat dried fertilizer. In order to keep up with the increase of influent wastewater produced by the ever-growing city of Los Angeles, by 1957 the plant engineers had cut back treatment levels and increased the discharge of a blend of primary and secondary effluent through a pipe into the ocean. They also opted to halt the production of fertilizers and started discharging digested sludge into the Santa Monica Bay through a pipe. Marine life in Santa Monica Bay suffered from the continuous discharge of of sludge per month. Samples of the ocean floor where sludge had been discharged for 30 years demonstrated that the only living creatures were worms and a hardy species of clam. Additionally, coastal monitoring revealed that bay waters often did not meet quality standards as the result of Hyperion's effluent. These issues resulted in the city entering into a consent decree with the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the California State Water Resources Control Board to build significant facility upgrades at Hyperion. In 1980, the city launched a massive \\"sludge-out\\" project that upgraded the plant to full secondary treatment. Sludge digesters are used to destroy the disease-causing organisms (pathogens). The sludge-out portion of the program was completed in 1987. The $1.6 billion sludge-out to full secondary construction program replaced nearly every 1950-vintage wastewater processing system at Hyperion while the plant continuously treated per day and met all of its NPDES permit requirements. As of 2016 the plant can treat per day, with a peak wet weather flow (partial treatment during storms) of per day. Water going through cleaning Process at Hyperion Water Treatment Plant. Majority of the water can be used as reclaimed water and remaining water that is not clean enough goes to the ocean. The West Basin Municipal Water District purchases approximately , or roughly 9 percent, of Hyperion's secondary effluent for treatment at the Edward C. Little Water Recycling Facility.  Reclaimed water  Hyperion sewage plant treats approximately of wastewater on a day-to-day basis. Treating this much water on a daily basis takes a lot of energy. The plant has cut costs with its own power plant that uses methane gas gathered from the waste to fuel the plant, saving money. Some of the wastewater is used for landscape irrigation, industrial processes, and groundwater replenishment.  Environmental controversies  Heal the Bay was founded in 1985 as a result of what was being done at Hyperion. Heal the Bay's original goal was to keep neighboring ocean water near the plant clean. At the time Hyperion was dumping used syringes, condoms, and tampons. Consequently, these products were going into the ocean through a pipeline having harmful effects on the ocean's ecosystem, people visiting the beach, and surfers. It took two years to have Hyperion accountable for their actions, and it took 12 years, along with $12.6 billion, to have Hyperion discharge clean water into the Santa Monica Bay. After this large-scale overhaul of the plant, Hyperion was up to the California regulations that were put in place in 1985. Heal the Bay provided information to the public in 2017 when Hyperion was undergoing maintenance work on a pipeline that goes into the ocean. During this time the plant used its emergency pipeline. This had negative impacts on local beaches such as a rise in chlorine and bacteria levels for two months. In popular culture Because of its hyper-industrial appearance and its location within the \\"studio zone\\", the Hyperion plant has been used numerous times as a location for feature films and television shows, among them Battle for the Planet of the Apes and The Terminator.John Landis, \\"Trailers From Hell - Battle for the Planet of the Apes\\" ReferencesFurther reading * Horenstein, B., Hernandez, G., Raspberry, G., Crosse, J.

Constructed in 1943 as a Royal Air Force (RAF) military airfield during the Second World War to assist damaged aircraft to land on their return from raids over Germany it was later used by the United States Air Force during the Cold War, being the primary home for the 79th Tactical Fighter Squadron and the 78th Tactical Fighter Squadron and squadrons of the 81st Fighter Wing under various designations until 1993. For many years, the 81st Fighter Wing also operated from nearby RAF Bentwaters, with Bentwaters and Woodbridge being known as the \\"Twin Bases\\". Since 2006, it has been known as MOD Woodbridge, incorporating Woodbridge Airfield and Rock Barracks. Woodbridge Airfield is used by Army Air Corps aircraft for training and Rock Barracks are home to the newly formed 23 Engineer Regiment (Air Assault) of the Royal Engineers. HistorySecond World War= Aerial view showing Woodbridge ELG at lower left with RAF Bentwaters at upper right, World War II, In 1943, Woodbridge was constructed in the south-east as one of three airfields set up to accept distressed aircraft returning from raids over Germany, and was therefore fitted with extra-long, heavy-duty runways (the other two being at RAF Manston in Kent and RAF Carnaby in Yorkshire). These airfields were intended for use by returning bombers suffering from low-fuel and suspected damage to their pneumatic (wheel brake) and/or hydraulic (undercarriage lowering) systems. All three airfields were equipped with a single runway, 9,000 ft (2,700 m) long and 750 ft (230 m) wide. (5 times the normal width) There was a further clear area of 1,500 ft (460 m) at each end of the runway. At each of the three airfields, the runway was divided into three 250 ft (76 m) lanes. The northern and central lanes were allocated by flying control, while the southern lane was the emergency lane on which any aircraft could land without first making contact with the airfield. It was initially called RAF Sutton Heath. The site at Woodbridge was chosen as it was 'nearly fog-free and had no obstructions for miles', although more than a million trees had to be cleared from Rendlesham Forest to take the new base. Its first use, however was in July 1943, when it was used by an American Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber. In the spring of 1944, Woodbridge was considered to be the operational base for Operation Aphrodite, a secret plan for drone B-17's (designated as BQ-7s), to be used against German V-1 flying bomb sites, submarine pens, or deep fortifications that had resisted conventional bombing. In early July, several B-17s, modified into BQ-7 drones, from the 562d Bomb Squadron of the 388th Bomb Group arrived at Woodbridge. The aircraft were stripped of all interior equipment and armament and packed with explosives. The plane would be flown by a human pilot, then handed over to radio control via a primitive television system, at which point the pilot parachuted out just before the English Channel came in sight. Another B-17 would act as a 'mother' ship, guiding the drone across the channel to its target. No Aphrodite mission was ever flown from Woodbridge because, after one aborted attempt, the unit moved up to RAF Fersfield, near Diss, Norfolk. On 13 July 1944, a Luftwaffe Ju 88 G-1 night fighter of 7 Staffel/NJG 2, bearing aircraft code 4R+UR, on North Sea night patrol landed at Woodbridge. This aircraft carried recent versions of the FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 radar, Naxos-Z and FuG 227 Flensburg homer \\\\- German Ju 88 mistakenly lands at RAF Woodbridge which were being successfully used to intercept RAF bombers. The German crew had only just completed 100 hours of flight training, and had flown by compass heading, but had proceeded in exactly the wrong direction and thought they were over their own airfield. Within days, the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) had analysed the radar equipment and devised countermeasures. About 30% of the emergency landings were caused by bad weather, especially fog which could be dispersed by Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (FIDO) where up to of petrol per hour was pumped through a system of pipes along the side of the runway and burnt to produce a wall of flames which would lift the fog. Fuel was transported to Melton railway station before being piped to the airfield.Noticeboard at entrance to base By the end of the Second World War 4,200 aircraft had made emergency landings at RAF Woodbridge. After the war the airfield was used for some experimental work by the RAF with Avro Lancasters being based there, dropping Grand Slam bombs on Orford Ness, and the Blind Landing Experimental Unit (BLEU) was located at Woodbridge. Eventually it was closed on 14 March 1948 and put into 'care and maintenance' status. =Cold War=79th Fighter Squadron As a result of the Cold War United States Air Force (USAF) buildup in Europe, Woodbridge was made available to the Americans by the Air Ministry in early 1952. Expansion of the facility to bring it up to NATO standards commenced on 16 April 1952, with the establishment of the 3928th Air Base Squadron. North American F-100F-10-NA Super Sabre, AF Serial No. 56-3888 of the 79th Tactical Fighter Squadron. This aircraft crashed 21 March 1962 near Chateauroux AB, France. The first operational USAF unit to reside at Woodbridge was the 79th Fighter-Bomber Squadron which arrived on 1 October 1952. The 79th TFS was a component of the 20th Fighter-Bomber Wing based at RAF Wethersfield. Restricted space at Wethersfield compelled the 79th Squadron to move initially to RAF Bentwaters on 6 June, then to Woodbridge, three miles southwest of Bentwaters, on 1 October. The 79th FBS flew the Republic F-84G \\"Thunderjet\\". Markings for the F-84s at Woodbridge consisted of yellow lightning flashes on the fuselage and on the external wing tip tanks. The mission of the 79th was to provide escort for Strategic Air Command (SAC) Boeing B-47 \\"Stratojet\\" rotational deployments from RAF Sturgate. These deployments generally involved about 45 aircraft, together with about 20 Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighters, which were maintained at English bases for 90 days. At the end of the Temporary Duty (TDY), they were relieved by another SAC wing that was generally stationed at a different airfield. These missions continued until 1964. In 1955, the 79th was upgraded to the swept-wing F-84F \\"Thunderstreak\\", with the older \\"G\\" models being transferred to other NATO countries or to the Middle East. Lightning flashes were not painted on the \\"F\\" models, but the yellow squadron colour band around the extreme rear of the fuselage remained a squadron marking. The 79th flew the F-84F only until 1958, when the 20th was redesignated a tactical fighter wing, and the squadron was re-equipped with the North American F-100 \\"Super Sabre\\". The 79th TFS was transferred to RAF Upper Heyford during January 1970 when Wethersfield was closed and the 20th TFW was reassigned. It has been reported that the US stored nuclear missiles at this site without the UK public knowing and that it was also the scene of a UFO sighting in 1980. Twin Base with RAF Bentwaters Beginning on 8 July 1958, Woodbridge was operated as \\"twin base\\" (twin airfield) with RAF Bentwaters, and as a single unit with Bentwaters under the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing. Along with the 79th from the 20th TFW, the 78th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron operated from the station, being transferred from RAF Shepherds Grove when the USAF turned Shepherds Grove over to the Air Ministry. Republic F-84G-6-RE Thunderjets of the 79th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, AF Serial Numbers 51-9939 and 51-9931, taken in 1954. With their replacement with the swept wing \\"F\\" models, 9939 was sold to the Norwegian AF and 9931 sold to the Italian AF Initially flying F-84F Thunderstreaks, in December they were replaced by the McDonnell F-101A/C \\"Voodoo\\", and redesignated as a Tactical Fighter Squadron. Markings of the 78th TFS were a red tail with silver star pattern design on the vertical stabilizer. In November 1965, the 78th TFS received McDonnell F-4C \\"Phantom II\\"s to replace the Voodoos, with red fin caps as their squadron marking. In October 1969 the F-4C aircraft were replaced with the F-4D. In February 1970, the 81st adapted tail codes, with \\"WR\\" being used by the 78th. In 1972, construction began on Woodbridge American High School and classes began in 1973. With the arrival of the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II in USAFE in 1979, the 81st TFW was expanded to six squadrons. Three of these were stationed at Woodbridge. Fairchild Republic A-10A Thunderbolt II, AF Serial No. Serial 81-0991, of the 91st Tactical Fighter Squadron, 7 June 1985. It was decided to expand the 81st with six A-10 squadrons distributed over both Woodbridge and Bentwaters as follows: * 78th Tactical Fighter (Received A-10s 3 June 1979) * 91st Tactical Fighter (Received A-10s 24 August 1979) * 509th Tactical Fighter (Activated 1 Oct 1979) (Grey tail stripe) (Received A-10s 1 October 1979) All the A-10 squadrons were tail-coded \\"WR\\". The 91st was transferred to Woodbridge from Bentwaters on 1 February 1980. The 509th was reactivated as an A-10 squadron, previously being an F-102 unit at Clark Air Base, Philippines. At Woodbridge, USAFE activated the 509th Tactical Fighter Squadron. The 509th was previously an F-102 squadron at and the 91st was moved to Woodbridge from Bentwaters. On 1 June 1988, the 509th was transferred to RAF Alconbury when the 10th transitioned from a Tactical Reconnaissance to a Tactical Fighter Squadron. 67th Air Rescue and Recovery Squadron A Sikorsky HH-53C Super Jolly Green Giant helicopter from the 67th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron lifts a derelict former Royal Air Force BAC Lightning fighter at RAF Woodbridge, Suffolk (UK), on 18 December 1987. The 67th Air Rescue and Recovery Squadron (ARRS) moved to RAF Woodbridge from Morón Air Base, Spain, on 15 January 1970. The 67th ARRS operated Lockheed HC-130H/N/P Hercules fixed wing aircraft, and heavy duty HH-53 Jolly Green Giant helicopters, and was assigned an air rescue and special operations mission. The 67th ARRS participated in the rescue efforts of the capsized Townsend Thoresen ferry Herald of Free Enterprise outside of Zeebrugge Harbour on 6 March 1987. On 1 June 1988, they were redesignated the 39th Special Operations Wing. On 1 April 1992 they moved to RAF Alconbury as part of the closure of RAF Woodbridge. =Deactivation – 1990s= With the end of the Cold War, the USAF presence at Woodbridge was gradually phased down. It was announced that the airfield would be closed, and the 81st TFW would be inactivated. Woodbridge-based squadrons were phased-down as follows: * 78th Tactical Fighter Squadron was inactivated on 1 May 1992. Its aircraft were sent back to the United States to various Air National Guard squadrons. * 91st Tactical Fighter Squadron was inactivated on 14 August 1992. Its aircraft were sent back to the United States to various Air National Guard squadrons. The last A-10 aircraft departed Woodbridge on 14 August 1993, and the airfield was closed as a US military facility. The 81st Tactical Fighter Wing was inactivated on 1 July 1993. With the inactivation, the USAF returned control of Woodbridge to the UK Ministry of Defence (The 81st was reactivated as the 81st Training Wing at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi on 1 July 1993). Current use On 1 September 2006, RAF Woodbridge became Ministry of Defence (MOD) Woodbridge. The site is operated by the British Army and incorporates both Rock Barracks and Woodbridge Airfield. The airfield is used by Army Air Corps aircraft for training and Rock Barracks are home to the newly formed 23 Engineer Regiment (Air Assault) of the Royal Engineers. The airfield is also regularly used to host track days, managed by companies such as Javelin Track Days. During August 2016 the runway was used for testing the Airbus A400M Atlas In November 2016 the Ministry of Defence announced that the site would close by 2027. On 28 February 2019, defence minister Tobias Ellwood announces that MOD Woodbridge (Rock Barracks) would remain open, altering previous closure plans.https://www.forces.net/news/uk/royal-marines-bases-among-uk- sites-remain-open See also * List of former Royal Air Force stations * United States Air Forces in Europe * United States Air Force in the United Kingdom * RAF Bentwaters * Rendlesham Forest Incident ReferencesCitationsBibliography= * Ravenstein, Charles A.

After Gupis, one continues northwest to reach the Yasin Valley. The part of the valley where Khowar is spoken is known in the Shina language as Arinah. = Villages = Administratively, Yasin constitutes Yasin Tehsil, which is part of Ghizer District.

Location It is situated at the southwest periphery of the city of Zhongshan and the eastern (left) bank of the Xi River. The town has an area of about and population of about 28,000 in 2000, plus 27,000 whose origins are not Dachong Town. It is reported there are about 10,000 Hong Kongers, people from Macau as well as overseas Chinese living here. History Dachong was once known as Longdu () in the Qing Dynasty. It is known that when villages were built since the Yuan Dynasty (14th century) and situated next to a river or stream which flowed towards the ancient sea of Shiqi, the region then was named after the river stream. The central region of the town was hilly, and the highest peak, Zhuoqishan (), is 164m high. Flat land is located at the south and the north, and rivers flow at the east and the west region. Economy As for other towns in Zhongshan, agriculture is the main primary industry found in Dachong Town. Major agricultural outputs include rice, vegetables, fruits and cane sugar. The production of mahogany furniture in Dachong can be traced back to the late 1970s when several carpenters started a workshop, producing broaching machines. Indeed, the early development of the mahogany furniture industry was driven by the carpenters from Zhejiang Province, who were experienced in making mahogany furniture. After the development for 20 years, the family-run furniture workshops in early years have become one of the pillar industries in Dachong. Currently there are a total of 496 enterprises engaging in the production of mahogany furniture in the town. Over a hundred specialized outlets on both sides of two main roads have formed an eye-catching avenue in the town. In 2001, the outputs of mahogany furniture reached RMB 598 million, accounting for nearly a quarter of the total industrial outputs of the whole town. Controlling 60 percent of the national production of mahogany furniture in 2002, Dachong was dubbed the \\"Specialized Town of Mahogany Furniture Production of China\\" by China National Furniture Association in April 2003. Its mahogany furniture has earned this small town a reputation at home and abroad for its Guangdong-style that is competitive nationwide, even in Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces, that are the origins of mahogany furniture. The export earnings of US$4.3 million in 2002 show that Dachong furniture is also popular worldwide, with large markets in the US, Japan, Canada and Russia. In order to consolidate its leading position in the production of mahogany furniture, producers in Dachong are restlessly upgrading their products and improving production techniques in recent years. In 2001, a technological development centre was established to develop and apply technology to the production of mahogany furniture. For example, the water-soluble paint, jointly developed by the centre and Xi'an Jiaotong University through a project involving investment of RMB 380000, aiming at reducing the production cost, and enabling the products to be more environmental friendly. The computerized drying system developed through a partnership with Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conservation of the Chinese Academy of Science, also makes the mahogany furniture more durable. Besides, under the quality control of the guild over all the mahogany furniture made in Dachong, products meeting the standards set by the town government are certified. To further develop the mahogany furniture industry, Dachong should put greater effort in registering design, image promotion and developing own brands that are not adequate currently.

Written by Dave Gibbons, and illustrated by Ivan Reis, Marc Campos, and John Kalisz, the series concerns a war between the planets Rann and Thanagar, and features Adam Strange, the Green Lantern Corps, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, L.E.G.I.O.N. and Captain Comet, along with other DC space adventurers. The series was followed in early 2006 with the one-shot book Rann-Thanager War: Infinite Crisis Special #1. Overview Rann-Thanagar War, along with Villains United, The OMAC Project, and Day of Vengeance, is one of four miniseries which lead up to DC Comics' Infinite Crisis event. Unlike most of the other tie-ins, it is also a continuation of storylines from two other series: Adam Strange: Planet Heist and Green Lantern: Rebirth. *Rann-Thanagar War #1-6, Infinite Crisis Special #1 *Adam Strange Special #1 *Hawkman #46-49, Special #1 *Rann/Thanagar Holy War #1-8 Pre-Crisis War In the continuity which existed prior to the Crisis on Infinite Earths limited series, a war erupted between the planets Rann and Thanagar. Rann's adopted hero Adam Strange and Thanagarian law enforcement officers Hawkman (Katar Hol) and Hawkgirl (Shayera Hol) worked desperately to end the conflict. The trio succeeded, eventually revealing that events leading up to the war were manipulated by the intergalactic criminal Kanjar Ro.Showcase #101-103 (June–August 1978) Series plot summary During Planet Heist, Adam Strange fought a rogue group of Thanagarians. During the battle, the leader of the group transported Strange's adopted homeworld of Rann into the Thanagarian system in the hope of creating a dictatorship. However, Rann's new location caused the orbit of Thanagar to become unstable, and the planet crashed into the system's sun. The surviving Thanagarians and Rannians now all live on Rann, and tensions are high between the two groups, as each blames the other for their predicament. Aware that war could erupt at any time, Strange goes to Earth to recruit the help of Hawkman and Hawkgirl, who are from Thanagar, in preventing a war. Meanwhile, Kyle Rayner and Captain Comet go to Thanagar to investigate, finding Onimar Synn and engaging in a battle, with Onimar Synn escaping through a drop ship. They then find hundreds of bodies buried underground, supplying Onimar Synn with energy, where Kilowog shows up. Later, Kilowog and Kyle Rayner terraform Thanagar back to life and save the underground bodies. When Strange and the Hawks arrive on Rann, they are shocked to see that the war has already begun. They form a team, including the Thanagarian Hawkwoman and the Tamaranean Blackfire. More and more planets are drawn into the war as Rann and Thanagar each call on their respective allies. Seeing a chance to seize power, Blackfire betrays the group, killing Hawkwoman in the process. It becomes clear that all factions have a common enemy: Onimar Synn. With the help of Tigorr of the Omega Men and Captain Comet, Strange's team manages to cut Synn into seven pieces, and each piece is inserted into a separate star to prevent him from reforming. At the end of the series, the assorted forces of Rann and Thanagar are faced with a fracture in space that resembles those that were seen during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Rann/Thanagar War: Infinite Crisis Special #1 - \\"Hands of Fate\\" In Rann/Thanagar War: Infinite Crisis Special #1, the rift begins endangering the lives of those in the star system by sending out destructive energy waves. Donna Troy's assembled heroes are working to keep the peace between the two warring forces, when Adam Strange receives a message from Tigorr of the Omega Men. He leads Strange, along with Hawkman and Hawkgirl, to a stray Thanagarian surveillance satellite, which has documented footage of Superboy-Prime forcing Rann and Thanagar to collide, and thus, go to war. Though the satellite is soon lost in the chaotic environment, Strange has an idea to gather the heads of each faction so that they might stop fighting amongst themselves and work together against the new cosmic threat. Meanwhile, Green Lantern Kyle Rayner has been working with former lover, Jade, to fight against the enormous hands forcing open a hole in spacetime. Unfortunately, Jade is unable to survive the electromagnetic energy surges and dies. In her last moments, she breathes the emerald energy that Kyle Rayner once granted her back into him, increasing his powers significantly. Kyle gives Jade's body to her father, Alan Scott, and he cradles her in his arms, remarking how she seems herself again, until another energy wave destroys her mortal remains. Kyle, once again calling himself Ion, tells Alan that as long as the two of them live on, her unique spirit and energy will continue. Upon Kyle's ascension, the Guardians note that he is the first of a \\"new breed, the next step in the evolution of our cause.\\" There is debate of whether so much power can be wielded by any Lantern, but Kyle's previous experience is considered, and the Guardians agree that being able to monitor him this time is an important difference. On the barren surface of Thanagar, Adam Strange finds evidence to present to all of the warring groups: handprints deep within an enormous crater, created by Superboy Prime's interference. L.E.G.I.O.N., Thanagar, Rann and New Cronus combine their forces to make a full assault on the force behind the rift, with Ion in the lead. Rann/Thanagar: Holy War On May 7, 2008, a new eight-issue limited series entitled Rann-Thanagar Holy War began publication.

It is situated approximately to the south-west of the town of Beverley on the B1230 road, and Beverley Grammar School. The civil parish is formed by the village of Walkington and the hamlet of Broadgate. According to the 2011 UK census, Walkington parish had a population of 2,337, a reduction on the 2001 UK census figure of 2,481. To the east of the village is Broadgate, the site of a former mental hospital, named Broadgate Hospital. Another part of the former Broadgate Farm estate has been developed into a complex of holiday cottages named Broadgate Farm Cottages. The village has three public houses located along the main road, East End. From West to East, these are the Dog and Duck, the Ferguson Fawsitt Arms and the Barrel. In the centre of Walkington is the village pond. The village school, Walkington Primary School is situated in Crake Wells, a minor street in the East End of the village. Before the year 1999 the school was divided between two sites which included the original school house at Northgate which dates back to the late 19th century. Before this, the street was called \\"School Lane\\". However, after a costly extension to the Crake Wells building, the infant and junior sections were joined together in 1999. The new building was officially opened by then Education Secretary David Blunkett, in October that year. The parish church of All Hallows is a Grade II* listed building. A Methodist church is situated next to West End. Ancient history A few miles west of Walkington is the Bronze Age barrow complex of Walkington Wold. The remains there include the Walkington Wold Burials, the decapitated remains of Anglo-Saxon criminals. To the east of the village is one of the medieval stone boundary markers for the sanctuary of Saint John of Beverley that is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Selection of Corieltauvi Celtic coins from the Walkington Hoard The Walkington Hoard, and other coins of the Corieltauvi tribe were discovered in large numbers between 2001 and 2008.

The film includes clips from both Gates of Heaven and Herzog's 1970 feature Even Dwarfs Started Small. Comic song \\"Old Whisky Shoes\\", played by the Walt Solek Band, is the signature tune over the opening and closing credits. Filmed in April 1979, the film features Herzog cooking his shoes (the ones he claims to have been wearing when he made the bet) at the Berkeley, California restaurant Chez Panisse, with the help of chef Alice Waters. (The shoes were boiled with garlic, herbs, and stock for 5 hours.) He is later shown eating one of the shoes before an audience at the premiere of Gates of Heaven at the nearby UC Theater. He did not eat the sole of the shoe, however, explaining that one does not eat the bones of the chicken. There are also clips of a short interview where Herzog discusses the destructive capitalistic effects of television and mankind's lack of adequate imagery. Morris is not shown in the film, and Herzog, Morris, and others have told different stories of the nature of the bet, disagreeing as to whether it was serious, flippant, or an after-the-fact publicity stunt. Blank went on to direct Burden of Dreams (1982), a feature-length documentary about Herzog and the making of Fitzcarraldo. Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe is included as an extra on The Criterion Collection edition of the Burden of Dreams DVD. It is also included as an extra in the Criterion Collection edition of the Gates of Heaven Blu-ray disc.

They attend all major sporting events for the Wisconsin Badgers as well as hundreds of other events around Wisconsin every year. Origin The as-yet unnamed Wisconsin mascot appeared as a human-like cartoon figure in University of Wisconsin publications in the 1930s.Gwen Schultz, The Bucky Badger Story, Madison, Wisconsin: Hammock & Inglenook, 1981. . The most familiar portrayal of Bucky Badger, wearing a \\"W\\" sweater and strutting forward with a fierce expression, was drawn by California-based commercial artist Art Evans in 1940, and first sold from Brown's Book Store in Madison. A popular version of Bucky sporting boxing gloves was first drawn by hometown Madison artist Thomas Spiece.https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/19/style/campus-life-wisconsin- contriving-a-shorter-leash-for-bucky-badger.html An actual badger from Eau Claire was used at the first few football games that year, but proved to be too fierce to be controlled properly and was retired to the nearby Henry Vilas Zoo. After that, the school replaced the live badger with a live raccoon named Regdab ('badger' backwards). In 1948, a UW-Madison art student, Carolyn (Connie) Conrard was asked to create a papier-mâché Bucky head-piece. A UW- Madison Gymnast and cheerleader, Bill Sagal, wore the outfit at the homecoming game and a contest was started to properly name the mascot. The winning entry was Buckingham U. Badger. Bucky has been maintained over the years, even surviving a threat by the assistant attorney general, Howard Koop, who suggested that Bucky be replaced by Henrietta Holstein, a loveable cow. In 2006, Bucky was inducted as a charter member of the Mascot Hall of Fame's College Division, joining YoUDee from Delaware, Sparty from the Michigan State University, and Aubie from Auburn. Attire and attitude \\"Boxing Bucky\\", circa 1965 Bucky Badger Bucky wears a cardinal red and white Wisconsin sweater along with a gruff look on his face (the costumed-mascot version is decidedly cheerier, with a beaming smile). During sporting events, he is generally seen interacting with the crowd, especially the rambunctious student section. For example, during football games Bucky often directs sections N, O, and P to dance along with the band's music or pretends to pick fights with certain students. He also has a history of playfully fighting other team's mascots like the University of Minnesota's Goldy Gopher or Purdue University's Purdue Pete. Although fighting is no longer allowed by NCAA mascots, Bucky still frequently interacts with other mascots through skits. Bucky also does push- ups to match the score after each touchdown, field goal, or safety. At the Indiana game on November 13, 2010 Bucky did 573 push-ups for the winning score of 83–20. Bill Sagal was the first costumed Bucky Badger. The original Bucky costume was introduced at a pep rally on Friday, November 11, 1949, before the next day's Homecoming game against Iowa (Wisconsin 35, Iowa 13). Carolyn (Connie) Conrard, a UW art student, designed the original chicken wire and papier-mâché head. Sagal, then head cheerleader, wore his regular cheerleader trousers and sweater and added boxing gloves.Chelsea Schlecht. \\"Happy Birthday Bucky\\". Wisconsin Alumni Association.

Logo alt=Classic Bucky Badger, 1988–2002The modern Bucky Badger logo was part of a group of \\"comic collegiate badger mascots\\" created by the Anson W. Thompson Company of Los Angeles in 1988. The company was one of several that manufactured decals and other logowear for universities. The Madison-based Brown's Book Store (no longer in business) was the first to order the pose. Other bookstores in the area ordered other poses. The UW athletic department first used the logo on the cover of the 1988 Football Facts and Centennial Sports Review. That image of Bucky was adopted and used by many local businesses in and around Madison. In 1988 the University of Wisconsin–Madison formed a trademark licensing program to register the Bucky logo, which was opposed by local merchants. Ownership was decided in the case University Book Store v. University of Wisconsin–Madison Board of Regents. The United States Patent and Trademark Office allowed the UW to register the marks despite previous third-party use on the grounds that the public identified the Bucky Badger logo with the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In 2003, Bucky was given an update, with simplified lines and the \\"motion W\\" on his sweater. This might have been done in part to give the University a version of Bucky that was associated with the University alone, and had never been used in any other context. Variations Academic departments and groups at UW-Madison have a rich history of modifying Bucky. Recent university guidelines, however, have banned the modification of Bucky Badger citing brand dilution despite featuring Bucky on other non- University items such as tortilla chips. Blind Bucky is sometimes used to represent the University of Wisconsin Law School as a variation of the allegorical figure of blindfolded Lady Justice.Blind Bucky, Wisconsin Law Alumni Association Emporium, University of Wisconsin Law School. Two variations of \\"Band Bucky\\" are used to represent the University of Wisconsin Marching Band. One variation shows him wearing a uniform similar to the drum major's, and the other shows him wearing a normal Wisconsin Band uniform. Various instrument sections within the band have also commissioned logos that include Bucky holding an instrument. Bucky with a stethoscope is occasionally used by the Medical Alumni Association. Similarly, a design of Bucky wearing a Roman-style toga is used by the university's Classics Society (and shared with the Classics Department). The College of Agriculture & Life Science's Short Course has a Farmer Bucky, clad in Motion W overalls and carrying a pitchfork. In addition, the Collegiate FFA has Bucky in Official Dress, including the standard FFA Jacket. The Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences department utilizes a design with Bucky holding a lightning bolt. Bucky has also been known to don a laboratory coat and carry an Erlenmeyer flask in support of University of Wisconsin-Madison laboratory sciences. Bucky also adorned the engine nacelles of the Wisconsin ANG in Madison during their tenure with the A-10 \\"Warthog\\". He was shown on both engines in all black tone, as the aircraft was in the \\"European one\\" paint at the time. This was short-lived as the unit converted to the F-16 in a short time. Student portrayal The students (usually 7) who portray Bucky Badger are all volunteers, without scholarships or financial reimbursement, as is the system in some universities. Tryouts include tests of dancing skills, expressiveness in suit, ability to work with props, and the number of push-ups a candidate can do, as well as an interview and the ability to write and perform an original skit. The Bucky Team attends mascot training camp every year in August. They perform throughout the year, including breaks and holidays, representing the university and the state at athletic events, but also at ceremonies, parades, festivals, weddings, and even an occasional funeral. Bucky appearances can be purchased; rates in 2007 were $250 plus $100 per hour, a \\"typical price\\" for school mascots. Film portrayal In 2009, Bucky Badger made it to the silver screen in the documentary, Being Bucky. The film, which was created by Chicago ad-men John Fromstein and Scott Smith, both Wisconsin natives, follows the 2007–2008 Buckys: Chris, Blake, Dave, Sky, Ryan, Craig and Jeff. It was released on April 4 at the Wisconsin Film Festival and featured in theaters across the state in the following weeks. Additionally, Bucky Badger is featured prominently in a parody of the song \\"Teach Me How to Dougie\\", appropriately titled \\"Teach Me How to Bucky\\". The music video, presented by Zooniversity Music, debuted during the 2010 UW Homecoming Game at Camp Randall vs. Minnesota Golden Gophers, a 41–23 Badgers win on October 9. T-shirts displayed in the video became commercially distributed the following week at local stores such as Name of the Game Apparel and Insignia. However, despite overwhelming popularity of the video, the use of a student athlete portrayal in the music video at the :31 second and 1:11 mark violated NCAA compliance issues as student athlete's likeness are prohibited from generating the sales. Specifically, NCAA regulations stipulate that “items that include an individual student-athlete’s name, picture or likeness, other than information items, may not be sold.” ReferencesExternal links * UW Badgers website * Photos of classic Bucky costumes from The University of Wisconsin Collection *The UW–Madison Office of Trademark Licensing controls the Bucky Badger logo's trademark. * Being Bucky, a documentary about what it's like to be the mascot *It ain't easy ‘Being Bucky’ Category:Big Ten Conference mascots Category:University of Wisconsin–Madison Category:Wisconsin Badgers ","title":"Bucky Badger"},{"id":"2471464","text":"Intellisync Corporation was a provider of data synchronization software for mobile devices, such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs).

On 29 September 2008 Nokia announced it planned to cease developing or marketing its own behind-the-firewall business mobility software(Intellisync Mobility Product Suite). The appropriate technologies and expertise would reallocate to Nokia's consumer push e-mail service. Nokia said it would integrate devices with software from vendors such as Microsoft, IBM, Cisco Systems and others. Products  The Intellisync Mobile Suite software was designed for corporations and wireless carriers. It included four modules, that can be installed independently or in any combination: wireless email, systems/device management, file sync and application sync. A specific application reverse proxy was sold as Intellisync Secure Gateway, for more secure firewall configuration. The intent is to provide database synchronization with the company's application sync product; email and PIM synchronization with wireless email, and mobile device management and static file distribution with device management/file sync. These products support synchronization with a corporation's Microsoft Exchange Server, Domino mail servers or Novell GroupWise, as well as POP and IMAP mail support. The company originally only provided software for Windows-based computers, Palm Devices, handheld PCs, and pocket PCs, but expanded into supporting Symbian, BREW, and other mobile devices. While the company originally marketed its product to large businesses (such as Boeing, Nintendo and the United States Military), it began rebranding its product to be distributed by wireless carriers as a revenue enhancing service to individual consumers. Wireless providers partnered with Intellisync included Verizon and Eurotel. Yahoo used Intellisync products. AutoSync Yahoo is a product written by Intellisync to synchronize Yahoo contacts, notes, calendars and tasks with Outlook Express and MS Outlook. Its primary competitor was Research in Motion (RIM).

It is performed by Barry Murphy, Risteárd Cooper and Gary Cooke. It grew out of Barry Murphy and Risteárd Cooper's Frank's Euro Ting sketches which first enlivened RTÉ's coverage of Euro '96 for which Rep. of Ireland had failed to qualify. \\"Après Match\\" proper was born when Gary Cooke joined the duo and soon became a fixture following each of Ireland's qualifying games for the 1998 World Cup. The show mocks famous, mostly Irish, soccer stars and pundits including Bill O'Herlihy, Eamon Dunphy, Johnny Giles, Liam Brady, Frank Stapleton, Colm Murray, Graeme Souness, Jackie Fullerton and Pat Jennings as well as pundits from the British channels, including Richard Keys, Andy Gray, Jamie Redknapp, Gary Lineker, Alan Hansen, Des Lynam, Jimmy Hill, Gordon Strachan, Terry Venables, Ian St John, Jimmy Greaves, Trevor Brooking, Brian Clough, Kevin Keegan, Barry Davies, David Coleman, Brian Moore and Gabby Logan. They also mock Irish television and radio personalities such as Marian Finucane, Miriam O'Callaghan, Vincent Browne, Tom McGurk, David McWilliams, Brent Pope, George Hook, Joe Duffy, Pat Kenny and Gerry Ryan. As of 2010, they have added politicians such as Brian Cowen, Brian Lenihan and Joan Burton to their repertoire. The Après Match team have sold-out venues all over Ireland including Vicar Street, the Olympia Theatre and the Gaiety Theatre. Football sketches 2006 World Cup sketches = Après Match performed sketches on RTÉ Two after many of the matches of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. As well as mocking the usual broadcasters, the team interviewed football fans in Germany. There were also a number of sketches following a mock attempt at a takeover by the Gaelic Athletic Association Head Assimilator of Foreign Games of the Match of the Day studios at BBC Television Centre in London and a Father Ted parody of FAI officials and Irish manager Steve Staunton. For the third place play-off match between Germany and Portugal, the team took over full studio coverage, as well as half-time and full-time analysis, as they had done for the corresponding match of the 2002 World Cup. =2006 Christmas special= \\"Bill O'Herlihy\\" A Christmas special was broadcast on RTÉ Two on St. Stephen's Day 2006. This edition featured highlights of Après Match sketches from 2006, including sequences from the previous summer's World Cup. The stars of the show interviewed the real RTÉ analysts including Ray Houghton, RTÉ commentator George Hamilton and Sky Sports' Chris Kamara. TV3 sports broadcaster Trevor Welch was lampooned, including having his vowels drawn out as he was interviewing fans from participating countries such as Costa Rica and Germany. The broadcast also featured extended highlights of the stars covering the third place play-off of the World Cup between Germany and Portugal. =Euro 2008 sketches= The trio marked their tenth anniversary with three weeks of sketches during UEFA Euro 2008. The tournament marked their biggest contribution yet to RTÉ's coverage of a major tournament. For the first time, Après Match had its own producer, Gráinne O'Carroll, and production team. The real O'Herlihy said that Après Match has played a significant part in what have been impressive viewing figures for a tournament that, in the absence of Ireland and England, he thought might not have generated much interest. He said: For O'Herlihy keeping his composure proved difficult and he was finally sent over the edge by the Frankly Speaking interview with Fernando Torres, when Frank Stapleton asked the player if it was difficult for him having the hopes of all of Spain resting on his shoulders \\"seeing as they're quite slopey\\". The rest of the panel had difficulty keeping their composure too, with the parodies on Andy Gray and Richard Keys of Sky Sports \\"often rendering a tearful Graeme Souness speechless\\". The highlights were released on DVD and broadcast as a TV Christmas special the following December. =2010 World Cup sketches= The team returned to RTÉ Two with brand new sketches and material for the duration of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Footballer Andy Reid made a guest appearance in two sketches. Sunderland A.F.C.'s Stadium of Light was used in one sketch. Dietmar Hamann and Osvaldo Ardiles, the newest pundits in RTÉ's World Cup team, also made appearances in the Après Match line up. For the 3rd place play-off match between Germany and Uruguay, the whole show (Preview, half-time and full-time analysis) was Après Match, and was followed by a \\"special edition\\" of Après Match in which the real RTÉ panel discussed Après Match. =Euro 2012 sketches= The team returned for a new round of sketches for the Euro 2012 tournament. They got off to a start with the sketch of the Irish showband Crystal Swing. Nearly all sketches after that featured Bill, Eamonn, John and Liam. During the tournament it featured more \\"Best of Apres Match\\" than new material. =Euro 2016 sketches= The team returned with brand new sketches for Euro 2016. They started off with a sketch that included the match between Ireland and England at Euro '88 when Ray Houghton scored the winning goal. After the Ireland-Sweden match, they returned once again with a sketch that included the football analysts in the RTÉ studio, Liam Brady and Eamon Dunphy, as well as presenter Darragh Maloney. After the Irish victory over Italy, the crew created a satirical sketch which was a parody of the TV3 studio, who are RTÉ's main competitor. Other sketches In addition to their football sketches, the trio also parodied the Irish political situation in 1982 when two general elections happened in a programme called Après Match Presents Election '82, which aired on RTÉ One on 24 February 2016. The trio also spoofed classic Ireland soccer matches in a series entitled Après Match of The Day. A second series of Apres Match of The Day began on Monday 6 March 2017 in which the trio introduced their own version of the 1979 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final between Dublin and Kerry and the mass that took place during the visit to Ireland made by Pope John Paul II at Ballybrit Racecourse. =Other footage= There are clips of some classic footage, news, events, weather, programmes and RTE advert breaks since the 1970s featured in it. Every Aprés Match programme will be on YouTube in future in full and clips.

R.B. Russell, as he was known, was a prominent figure in the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 and was later the leader of Winnipeg's One Big Union. Born in Scotland, Russell was raised in Glasgow and came to Canada in 1911. He moved to Winnipeg, and worked as a machinist in the Canadian Pacific Railway's Weston Shops. He was a member of the Machinists Union Local Lodge 122 in Winnipeg. He also became a prominent member of the Socialist Party of Canada, which at the time represented the left-wing of the labour movement in Manitoba. In 1919, he attended the Western Labour Conference in Calgary, Alberta, and called for the replacement of narrow craft unionism with an industrial union known as the One Big Union. During the Winnipeg General Strike, he became a prominent figure in the Strike Committee which managed most city affairs. After the strike was suppressed, Russell and other strike leaders were arrested on charges of seditious conspiracy. He was the first of the strikers to go to trial, and was sentenced to a two-year term at Stony Mountain Federal Penitentiary. Many observators at the time, and many since, have regarded the charges against the strike leaders as unjust and politically motivated. The strike and the resulting arrests created a temporary climate of labour unity in the city. The SPC had previously opposed \\"popular front\\" campaigns with centrist labour parties, and Russell himself had argued in 1918 that it was pointless to elect labour representatives to capitalist legislatures. Nevertheless, the SPC agreed to participate in a \\"united labour\\" slate for the 1920 provincial election. Russell, still serving a prison sentence, ran as an SPC candidate in the constituency of Winnipeg, which elected ten members by a single transferable ballot. He came very close to being elected, finishing ninth on the first count and missing the tenth seat by only sixty-two votes on the final tally. Russell's fellow prisoner George Armstrong was elected for the SPC, and so became the only member of the party ever to serve in the Manitoba legislature. Russell also ran for the Socialist Party of Canada in the 1921 federal election, contesting the single-member riding of Winnipeg North. He finished a close second, losing to Liberal Edward James McMurray by 715 votes. Russell returned to labour activism following his release from prison in 1922. He was selected as the leader of the Winnipeg's One Big Union, and held this position into the 1950s. He campaigned again for the Manitoba legislature in the 1927 provincial election in the constituency of Assinboia, just west of Winnipeg. As the SPC had folded in 1925, Russell contested this election with support from Manitoba's Independent Labour Party. He again lost by a narrow margin, falling sixty votes behind Conservative candidate Joseph Cotter. There is currently an R.B. Russell Vocational High School in Winnipeg.

It is the only single gender school run by the Calgary Board of Education (CBE), and is one of a very small number of fully public single-gender schools in Canada. The school was named to honor Alice Jamieson, an advocate of women's rights in the early 1900s, and the second female magistrate in Canada (and the rest of the British Commonwealth). History The idea of an all-female publicly funded school in Calgary was first formally proposed by The Calgary Girls' School Society to the Calgary Board of Education, who sought a charter from the board. The board rejected the proposal. After the rejection, the society received a public charter directly from the province, and opened the Calgary Girls' School (CGS) in 2003. While the board opposed the idea of a charter school, it did support the idea of an all-female school, so it opened AJGA as its own all-female school also in 2003. The two schools are similar in several ways: all-female, grades 4-9, mandatory uniforms, female-mentorship, and a female perspective in viewing history and other subjects taught; but are different mainly in administration and accountability issues. As an alternative program school, AJGA has somewhat more freedom and independence than a typical CBE school, but far less than the autonomy a charter school, like CGS, has. Some criticized the board for opening an all-female school, while there was no all-male school. This situation has been rectified with the opening of the All-Boys Alternative Program school at the Sir James Lougheed School in Southwest Calgary in September 2011. Philosophy There are several reasons given for having an all-female school. Partly it's designed to avoid the distraction of girls worrying about their appearance, when boys are around. Sometimes, its believed, girls underperform, to avoid embarrassing male peers. More significantly, its believed by supporters, that the genders actually learn in fundamentally different manners, with different ways of thinking and communicating. While following the standard Alberta government curriculum, the school goes into greater depth when discussing the role of women in history and other areas of study. According to the school's first principal, Dr. Ursula D. Steele, \\"Girls need an understanding of the biological and social construction of gender\\".

The short-lived but intense tornado struck without warning and caused three deaths and 500 injuries. The storm, rated F4 on the Fujita scale, also caused more than $400 million in property damage along an path, and ranks as the ninth most destructive tornado in American history.Data from the Storm Prediction Center archives, which are accessible through SeverePlot, free software created and maintained by John Hart, lead forecaster for the SPC. Storm synopsis The storm system that caused the tornado had produced severe weather, including two weak tornadoes, in eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey that morning. This was an unusual setup for a significant tornado, associated with a warm front near a low-pressure center. A thunderstorm cell formed south of Long Island around 10:20 am, and became a supercell sometime later after interacting with a surface low-pressure center. It turned north as a left-moving supercell, meaning it moved left with respect to the mean atmospheric flow. Left-moving supercells are very rare, as cyclonic storms usually turn to the right of the mean flow.Anticyclonic (Left- Moving) Supercell National Weather Service Birmingham, Alabama. Accessed 2009-06-05. It is unknown whether this leftward movement was due to an atmospheric interaction or terrain-induced movement, as the storm moved straight up the Connecticut River valley. Infra-red weather satellite image of the northeastern United States at 3 pm local time (the same time the tornado touched down) No tornado watches or warnings were issued before the storm struck. This was later determined to be because of missing atmospheric sounding data, as well as an incorrect assessment of the height of the tropopause, which led to an underestimation of the strength of the thunderstorm which produced the tornado. Although a severe thunderstorm warning was issued at 2:57 pm, very few people received the warnings in time. Eyewitness reports have the tornado ripping the roof off a grocery store in Wethersfield, Connecticut. Trees were uprooted in East Hartford, Connecticut. The tornado then touched down in Poquonock, Connecticut, a village in the town of Windsor, just north of Hartford. Poquonock Elementary School was heavily damaged; fortunately, students were sent home early at 1:30 pm on Wednesdays. Students at a Brownie meeting were led into a hallway just before the auditorium they had been in was destroyed. The historic Poquonock Community Church building had its roof ripped off. All but one of the stained glass windows from the old church was salvaged. The tornado traveled almost due north, an unusual direction for a tornado. The most severe damage occurred along River Road, Hollow Brook Road, Pioneer Drive and Settler Circle, where large frame houses were left \\"in splinters\\". The tornado roughly followed Connecticut Route 75 just east of Bradley International Airport. The airport's weather station recorded a wind gust of as the tornado passed nearby. A United Airlines flight with 114 passengers was attempting to land as the tornado was passing the airport; the pilot saw the tornado and was able to abort the landing just in time. The tornado then crossed the northern portion of the airport, where the New England Air Museum was located. More than 20 vintage aircraft were completely destroyed, with many more damaged. The museum's hangar was also rendered unusable. The tornado moved north into Feeding Hills before dissipating near the Westfield city line, about five miles north of the Massachusetts state line. The tornado was accompanied by more than of rain, and several instances of downburst winds. Damage from downburst winds was reported across the Connecticut River in Enfield. Aftermath Because there were no tornado warnings before the storm (and it occurred in an area where tornadoes are rare), the initial damage reports claimed an explosion had damaged a roof. Soon, however, the storm's nature and impact became apparent. Governor Ella Grasso lived just a block away from the tornado's path, though she was in Hartford at the time of the storm. She declared an 8 pm-5 am curfew in the days following the tornado. About 500 National Guardsmen were activated to prevent looting and direct traffic, and the area was declared a disaster area by President Carter. FEMA trailers were provided within a few days, and were used by many residents until reconstruction or repairs could be completed. In all, at least 38 businesses were damaged or destroyed, 65 homes were completely destroyed, and at least 75 homes were damaged. Twenty-five tobacco sheds were \\"extensively damaged\\". At the airport, at least 30 vintage aircraft were damaged or destroyed, as well as most of the state's National Guard helicopters. The final damage total reached $200 million (1979 USD), or $685 million in 2017 dollars. Because of the vast scope of the damage, initially Windsor town officials feared many, possibly even hundreds, of people could have been killed. While there were many serious injuries, only three people were killed by the storm. Two victims, construction workers working in a bank parking lot, took shelter in a work truck when they saw the storm approach. The first victim was killed immediately by a piece of flying lumber, the other died a few weeks later from his injuries becoming the 3rd victim. The second victim was found the next day across the street from her obliterated house. Over 400 people were hospitalized, mostly for injuries from flying glass or the victims' having been thrown by winds. Records The tornado was the costliest on record in the Northeastern United States, and the 10-costliest in US history. The three people who were killed made it the deadliest tornado in Connecticut since the 1878 Wallingford tornado.Tornado Project. \\"Worst\\" Tornadoes Retrieved on July 2, 2007.

It provides application cluster capabilities to systems running other applications, including databases, network file sharing, and electronic commerce websites. Description High- availability clusters (HAC) improve application availability by failing or switching them over in a group of systems—as opposed to high-performance clusters, which improve application performance by running them on multiple systems simultaneously. Most Veritas Cluster Server implementations attempt to build availability into a cluster, eliminating single points of failure by making use of redundant components like multiple network cards, storage area networks in addition to the use of VCS. Similar products include Fujitsu PRIMECLUSTER, IBM PowerHA System Mirror, HP Serviceguard, IBM Tivoli System Automation for Multiplatforms (SA MP), Linux-HA, OpenSAF, Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS), NEC ExpressCluster, Red Hat Cluster Suite, SteelEye LifeKeeper and Sun Cluster. VCS is one of the few products in the industry that provides both high availability and disaster recovery across all major operating systems while supporting 40+ major application/replication technologies out of the box. VCS is mostly a user-level clustering software; most of its processes are normal system processes on the systems it operates on, and have no special access to the operating system or kernel functions in the host systems. However, the interconnect (heartbeat) technology used with VCS is a proprietary Layer 2 ethernet-based protocol that is run in the kernel space using kernel modules. The group membership protocol that runs on top of the interconnect heartbeat protocol is also implemented in the kernel. In case of a split brain, the 'fencing' module does the work of arbitration and data protection. Fencing too is implemented as a kernel module. The basic architecture of VCS includes LLT ( Low Latency Transport ), GAB ( Global Membership services and Atomic Broadcast Protocol ), HAD ( High Availability Daemon ), and Cluster Agents. LLT lies at the bottom of the architecture and acts as conduit between GAB and underlying network. It receives information from GAB and transmits across to intended participant nodes. While LLT module on one node interacts with every other node in the cluster, the communication is always 1:1 between individual nodes. So in case if certain information needs to be transmitted across all cluster nodes assuming a 6 nodes cluster, 6 different packets are sent across targeted to individual machine interconnects. GAB determines which machines are part of cluster and minimum number of nodes that need to be present and working to form the cluster ( this minimum number is called seed number ). GAB acts as an abstract layer upon which other cluster services can be plugged in. Each of those cluster services need to register with GAB and is assigned a predetermined unique port name ( a single alphabet). GAB has both a client and server component. Client component is used to send information using GAB layer and registers with Server component as Port \\"a\\". HAD registers with GAB as port \\"h\\". Server portion of GAB interacts with GAB modules on other cluster nodes to maintain membership information with respect to different ports. The membership information conveys if all the cluster modules corresponding to ports ( For example GAB ( port \\"a\\" ), HAD ( port \\"h\\" ) etc ) on different cluster nodes are in good shape and able to communicate in intended manner with each other. HAD layer is the place where actual high availability for applications are provided. This is the place where applications actually plug into High availability framework. HAD registers with GAB on port \\"h\\". HAD module running on one node communicates with HAD modules running on other cluster nodes in order to ensure all the cluster nodes have same information with respect to cluster configuration and status. In order for applications to be able to plug into High Availability Framework, it needs Cluster agent software. Cluster Agent softwares can be generic or specific to each type of application. For example, for Oracle to utilize HA ( High Availability ) framework in VCS, it needs an agent software. VCS at base is generic Cluster software and may not know how different applications start, stop, monitor, clean etc. This information needs to be coded into Agent software. Agent software can be thought of as a translator between application and HA framework. For example, if HAD needs to stop Oracle Database, by default, it will not know how to stop it, however, if it has Oracle DB agent running on it, it will ask Oracle agent to stop database and by definition, agent will issue commands specific to DB version and configuration and monitor the stop status. Important files where cluster configuration information is kept : LLT : /etc/llttab , /etc/llthosts GAB : /etc/gabtab HAD ( VCS ) : /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config/main.cf , /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config/types.cf , /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/sysname Veritas Cluster Server for Windows is available as a standalone product. It is also sold bundled with Storage Foundation as Storage Foundation HA for Windows; Veritas Cluster Server for AIX, HP-UX, Linux, and Solaris is supplied as a standalone product.

His work earned him the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. He was a professor of English at the University of Massachusetts AmherstJames Tate elected to American Academy of Arts and Letters , a April 29, 2004 article from University of Massachusetts Amherst and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Biography Tate was born in Kansas City, Missouri, where he lived with his mother and his grandparents in his grandparents' house. His father, a pilot in World War II, had died in combat on April 11, 1944, before Tate was a year old. Tate and his mother moved out after seven years when she remarried. The eventual poet said he belonged to a gang in high school and had little interest in literature. He planned on being a gas station attendant as his uncle had been, but finding that his friends to his surprise were going to college, he applied to Kansas State College of Pittsburg (now Pittsburg State University) in 1961. Tate wrote his first poem a few months into college with no external motivation; he observed that poetry \\"became a private place that I was hugely drawn to, where I could let my daydreams—and my pain—come in completely disguised. I knew from the moment I started writing that I never wanted to be writing about my life.\\" In college he read Wallace Stevens and William Carlos Williams and was \\"in heaven\\". He received his B.A. in 1965, going on to earn his M.F.A. from the University of Iowa's famed Writer's Workshop. During this period he was finally exposed to fellow poets and he became interested in surrealism, reading Max Jacob, Robert Desnos, and André Breton; for Benjamin Péret he expressed particular affection. Of poets writing in Spanish, César Vallejo \\"destroyed\\" him but he was not so taken by the lyricism or romanticism of Pablo Neruda or Federico García Lorca. He was married to Dara Wier. Tate died on July 8, 2015 at the age of 71.http://www.recorder.com/home/17684626-95/acclaimed-poet-umass- professor-james-tate-dies-at-71 Career Tate taught creative writing at the University of California, Berkeley, Columbia University, and at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he worked from 1971 until his death in 2015. He was a member of the poetry faculty at the MFA Program for Poets & Writers, along with Dara Wier and Peter Gizzi. Dudley Fitts selected Tate's first book of poems, The Lost Pilot (1967), for the Yale Series of Younger Poets while Tate was still a student at the Writers' Workshop; Fitts praised Tate's writing for its \\"natural grace.\\" Tate's first volume of poetry, Cages, was published by Shepherd's Press, Iowa City, 1966. Tate won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize and the Poetry Society of America's William Carlos Williams Award in 1991 for his Selected Poems. In 1994, he won the National Book Award for his poetry collection Worshipful Company of Fletchers. Tate's writing style is often described as surrealistic, comic and absurdist.Ellman, Richard and Robert O'Clair.The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry, Second edition. New York: W.W. Norton, 1988. His work has captivated other poets as diverse as John Ashbery and Dana Gioia.Tate, James. Selected Poems. Blurb. Regarding his own work, Tate said, \\"My characters usually are—or, I’d say most often, I don’t want to generalize too much—but most often they’re in trouble, and they’re trying to find some kind of life.\\" This view is supported by the poet Tony Hoagland's observation that \\"his work of late has been in prose poems, in which his picaresque speaker or characters are spinning through life, inquisitive and clueless as Candide, trying to identify and get with the fiction of whatever world they are in.\\" In addition to many books of poetry, he published two books of prose, Dreams of a Robot Dancing Bee (2001) and The Route as Briefed (1999). Some of Tate's additional awards included a National Institute of Arts and Letters Award, the Wallace Stevens Award, and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. He was also a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets.

Background The album was the second in a short-term recording deal with major label A&M; Records, who had a \\"Modern Masters Jazz Series\\" imprint going at the time. Sun Ra's profile had risen considerably in recent years, partially because of the support given to the master in interviews by avant-garde alternative rock band Sonic Youth around that time, who had both named him as an influence and opened shows for Ra and his Arkestra. The album was recorded in one marathon session at BMG Studios in New York City, using a 22-piece group that included several Arkestra members or veterans, including three drummers and two bass players (one on upright bass and another on electric bass), plus fellow free jazz musician Don Cherry, who contributed his trademark pocket trumpet work. During the session, Cherry sat at the right of Ra and his piano. Seven tracks were used for the Purple Night album; the remainder of the master multi-track tapes were given to Sun Ra and his manager Alton Abraham for future release on their own after the A&M; deal concluded; much of these recordings were released three years later by Rounder Records on the album Somewhere Else, released shortly before Sun Ra's death. Currently the Purple Night album is out of print physically (the album is available on iTunes and other digital outlets) and the copyright on the original album passed on to Sun Ra’s estate’s holding company, Sun Ra LLC, in 2016.

Some treaties, notably the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, provide internationally agreed- upon \\"schedules\\" of controlled substances, which have been incorporated into national laws; however, national laws usually significantly expand on these international conventions. Some precursor chemicals used for the production of illegal drugs are also controlled substances in many countries, even though they may lack the pharmacological effects of the drugs themselves. Substances are classified according to schedules and consist primarily of potentially psychoactive substances. The controlled substances do not include many prescription items such as antibiotics.Controlled Substance Act  Laws and enforcement  In the United States, the Drug Enforcement Administration is the federal government agency responsible for suppressing illegal drug use and distribution by enforcing the Controlled Substances Act, which regulates both the drugs themselves and certain precursors. Some U.S. states have additional restrictions for substances which might or might not be regulated by the federal government. During the Obama Administration, the federal government also voluntarily suspended enforcement of federal laws restricting marijuana where people were operating in compliance with state law. Some states in the U.S. have statutes against health care providers self-prescribing and/or administering substances listed in the Controlled Substance Act schedules. This does not forbid licensed providers from self-prescribing medications not on the schedules. In the United Kingdom, the term \\"controlled drug\\" (CD) is used for substances governed by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.answers.com Other national drug prohibition laws include the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada) and the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 (New Zealand), among many others. Within Europe controlled substance laws are legislated at the national rather than by the EU itself, with significant variation between countries in which and how chemicals are classified as controlled. Only drug precursor laws are legislated for at the European level.  Use of Controlled Substances for Research  A common misunderstanding amongst researchers is that most national laws allow the use of small amounts of a controlled substance for non-clinical / non-in vivo research without licences. A typical use case might be having a few milligrams or microlitres of a controlled substance within larger chemical collections (often 10K's of chemicals) for in vitro screening. Researchers often believe that there is some form of “research exemption” for such small amounts. This incorrect view maybe further re-enforced by R&D; chemical suppliers often stating and asking scientists to confirm that anything bought is for research use only. A further misconception is that controlled substances laws simply list a few hundred substances (e.g. MDMA, Fentanyl, Amphetamine, etc.) and compliance can be achieved via checking a CAS number, chemical name or similar identifier. However, the reality is that most countries enact “generic statement\\" or “chemical space” laws, which aim to control all chemicals similar to the “named” substance. These either provide detailed descriptions similar to Markushes, or simply state analogues are also controlled. In addition, control of most named substances is extended to control of all of their ethers, esters, salts and stereoisomers. Due to this complexity in legislation the identification of controlled chemicals in research is often carried out computationally, either by in house systems maintained a company's sample logistics department or by the use commercial software solutions. Automated systems are often required as many research operations can often have chemical collections running into 10Ks of molecules at the 1–5 mg scale, which are likely to include controlled substances, especially within medicinal chemistry research. These may not have been controlled when created, but they have subsequently been declared controlled. = Known research exemptions = Switzerland. Has limited exemptions to some Directory E substances, but which substances are covered and what the exemption allows depends on the substance, for example compounds similar to Fentanyl allow for “Von der Kontrolle ausgenommen ist die industrielle und die wissenschaftliche Verwendung. Der private Gebrauch ist nicht von der Kontrolle ausgenommen” or “Excluded from the control is the industrial and scientific use. Private use is not exempt from the control.” The exemption wording for Cyclohexylphenols is “Cyclohexylphenole sind von der Kontrolle nach den Kapiteln 5 und 6 der Verordnung über die Betäubungsmittelkontrolle vom 25. Mai 2011 ausgenommen, wenn sie von Unternehmen mit einer Betriebsbewilligung für den Umgang mit kontrollierten Substanzen des Verzeichnisses e industriell eingesetzt werden. Für Substanzmengen bis zu 100 g benötigen diese Unternehmen keine Ein- oder Ausfuhrbewilligung.” or “Cyclohexylphenols are exempted from the control under Chapters 5 and 6 of the Narcotics Control Ordinance of 25 May 2011 if they are used industrially by undertakings holding an operating license for the handling of controlled substances in Inventory e. For substance quantities of up to 100g, these companies do not require an import or export license”. In addition, import or export authorization is not required in case of controlled substances for analytical purpose in concentrations up to 1 mg/ml. (Art 23, Abs. 2b, BetmKV) Further qualifications apply e.g. yearly limits as well individual shipment limits United Kingdom There are no specific research exemptions in the Misuse of Drugs Act. However, the associated Misuse of Drug Regulations 2001 does exempt products containing less than 1 mg of a controlled substance (1 ug for lysergide and derivatives) so long as a number of requirements are met, including that it cannot be recovered by readily applicable means, does not pose a risk to human health and is not meant for administration to a human or animal. Although this does at first seem to allow research use, in most circumstances the sample, by definition, is “recoverable” - in order to prepare it for use the sample is ‘recovered’ into an assay buffer or solvent such as DMSO or water. In 2017 the Home Office also confirmed that the 1 mg limit applies to the total of all preparations across the entire container in the case of sample microtitre plates. Given this, most companies and researchers choose not to rely on this exemption. According to Home Office licensing, \\"University research departments generally do not require licences to possess and supply drugs in schedules 2, 3, 4 part I, 4 part II and schedule 5, but they do require licences to produce any of those drugs and to produce, possess and/or supply drugs in schedule 1\\". United States of America In the US no general research exemptions are known to exist, at least at the federal level and the Controlled Substances Act. Germany The Gesetz über den Verkehr mit Betäubungsmitteln (Betäubungsmittelgesetz - BtMG) / (Law on the Traffic in Narcotic Drugs (Narcotics Act - BtMG) has a partial exemption that might apply to certain research areas. For each schedule the act allows for the preparations of the substances listed in this Appendix if they are not a) without being applied to or in the human or animal body, for diagnostic or analytical purposes only, and their content of one or more anesthetics not exceeding 0.001 per cent, or isotope-modified in the preparations, or b) are particularly excluded; die Zubereitungen der in dieser Anlage aufgeführten Stoffe, wenn sie nicht a) ohne am oder im menschlichen oder tierischen Körper angewendet zu werden, ausschließlich diagnostischen oder analytischen Zwecken dienen und ihr Gehalt an einem oder mehreren Betäubungsmitteln jeweils 0,001 vom Hundert nicht übersteigt oder die Stoffe in den Zubereitungen isotopenmodifiziert oder b) besonders ausgenommen sind; The exact percentage various for each schedule.

It was a liquid-cooled 12-cylinder inverted V12 enlargement of the DB 601, which was in itself a development of the DB 600. Production of the DB 603 commenced in May 1942, and with a 44.52 litre displacement figure, was the largest displacement inverted V12 aviation engine to be produced and used in front line aircraft of the Third Reich during World War II. The DB 603 powered several aircraft, including the Do 217 N&M;, Do 335, He 219, Me 410, BV 155 and Ta 152C. Design and development A Do 217N night fighter with Kraftei-format DB 603s fitted BV 238 V1 flying boat with Kraftei DB 603s, similar to Do 217s The Mercedes-Benz T80 land speed record car, designed by aircraft engineer Josef Mickl with assistance from Ferdinand Porsche and top German Grand Prix racing driver Hans Stuck, incorporated the third prototype DB 603. It was set up for the land speed record run attempt to operate on an exotic fuel mix based on a 63% methanol, 16% benzene and 12% ethanol content, with minor percentages of acetone, nitrobenzene, avgas and ether. Adding to the power output was a pioneering form of the Luftwaffe's later MW 50 methanol/water injection boost, and was tuned to 3,000 PS (2,959 hp, 2,207 kW)— enough, it was believed, to propel the aerodynamic three-axle T80 up to 750 km/h on a specially-prepared, nearly length stretch of the roughly north/south oriented Berlin — Halle/Leipzig, which passed close to the east side of Dessau (now part of the modern A9 Autobahn) and with the actual length's location due south of Dessau, reworked to be wide with a paved-over median, for the record to be set in January 1940 during Rekord Woche (Record/Speed Week). Due to the outbreak of the war in September 1939, the T80 (nicknamed Schwarzer Vogel, \\"Black Bird\\") never raced. The DB 603 engine was removed from the vehicle for use in fighter aircraft. As Germany's largest displacement inverted V12 aviation powerplant in production during the war years, the DB 603 saw wide operational use as the primary engine type for many twin and multi-engined combat aircraft designs — the promising twin-engined Dornier Do 335 Pfeil prototype heavy fighter, the front-line Messerschmitt Me 410 Hornisse heavy fighter and Heinkel He 219 Uhu twin-engined night fighter were all designed for DB 603 power. The Dornier Do 217M and -N medium bomber and night fighter subtypes powered by inline engines, and the enormous sixty- metre wingspan, six-engined Blohm & Voss BV 238 flying boat prototype, essentially had their DB 603 powerplants installed within what appeared to be the same unitized complete engine/cowl/radiator assembly as a complete unit- replaceable \\"power system\\" for twin and multi-engined aircraft — this particular design featured a \\"chin\\"-style radiator installation directly beneath the crankcase, and the oil cooler placed on the dorsal portion of the installation for the earlier examples, as the BV 238 had no visible upper-cowl openings for engine cooling of any sort for its half-dozen unitized DB 603s. The He 219 airframe pioneered what is believed to be a Heinkel-specific Kraftei unitized engine package for the DB 603 engine using a well-streamlined annular radiator set for primary engine cooling between the propeller and its reduction gear housing with a nearly-cylindrical cowl behind it, pierced only by the twin rows of six exhaust stacks, one row per side. The characteristic portside-cowl supercharger intake for Daimler-Benz inverted V12s was usually accommodated away from the nacelle's sheetmetal itself for the Heinkel/DB 603 unitized engine package, most often within the airframe's wing panel design. The same Kraftei packaging for the He 219 was also used for powering the four- prototype He 177B strategic bomber series, and with an added turbocharger in each nacelle, the six ordered (two completed) prototypes of Heinkel's He 274 high-altitude strategic bomber project.

[Consulted 23 Feb 2018] originating in Catalonia\\"Diez inventos españoles que pasaron a la historia\\", ABC, 29-11-2011 (in Spanish). [Consulted 23 Feb 2018] and eventually spreading to other parts of Spain.\\"Nostrat i popular\\", by David Roman, Papers de vi No. 9, Winter 2011, p. 18 (in Catalan). [Consulted 23 Feb 2018] This invention allows everyone to drink from the same utensil without touching it with their lips. It fosters communal drinking accompanying food, though it does require some skill to ensure the wine enters one's mouth and to keep it from spilling onto clothing. Some might say it resembles a cross between a wine bottle and a watering can. The top of the bottle is narrow and can be sealed off with a cork. Stemming upwards from the bottom of the pitcher is a spout that gradually tapers off to a small opening. It is shaped such that the wine stored inside it will have minimal contact with the air, while being ready to be used at all times. Until the mid-twentieth century it was very common in homes, but the tradition is now slowly being lost. The idea originated as a replacement to bota bags. Porrons are most commonly filled with regular wines, either white or red, but are also used to drink cava, and a smaller version filled with a sweet, dessert wine (typically Grenache) is also common in Catalan restaurants. The lack of contact with the lips allows a group of people to share the same vessel without offending their sense of hygiene.  Drinking from a porrón  To drink from a porró, a beginner starts by bringing the spout very close to his or her mouth and tilts it forward slowly so the beak points towards the teeth. Once the liquid starts coming out, the porrón is pulled away from the face while the drinker looks up. To finish drinking, a beginner lowers the porrón and brings it back down and closer to the mouth again before stopping, quickly tilting the spout up at the last moment so there is no spillage. A regular user can start and stop drinking from the porrón with the spout held at a distance without spilling a drop. Although drinking from porrons has been largely replaced with bottles and glasses, they are still a feature of Catalan/Spanish-themed restaurants, mainly as a novelty for diners to test their skills. The porrón in literature George Orwell described a porrón in Homage to Catalonia: See also * The botijo, called a càntir in Catalan, is a clay jar used for cooling water. The drinking style is similar to that of the porrón.

It is used to improve the availability of software services such as databases, file sharing on a network, electronic commerce websites, or other applications. Sun Cluster operates by having redundant computers or nodes where one or more computers continue to provide service if another fails. Nodes may be located in the same data center or on different continents. Sun Microsystems Solaris Cluster  Background  Solaris Cluster provides services that remain available even when individual nodes or components of the cluster fail. Solaris Cluster provides two types of HA services: failover services and scalable services. To eliminate single points of failure, a Solaris Cluster configuration has redundant components, including multiple network connections and data storage which is multiply connected via a storage area network. Clustering software such as Solaris Cluster is a key component in a Business Continuity solution, and the Solaris Cluster Geographic Edition was created specifically to address that requirement. Solaris Cluster is an example of kernel-level clustering software. Some of the processes it runs are normal system processes on the systems it operates on, but it does have some special access to operating system or kernel functions in the host systems. In June 2007, Sun released the source code to Solaris Cluster via the OpenSolaris HA Clusters community.

It enables two Solaris Cluster installations to be managed as a unit, in conjunction with one or more Data replication products, to provide Disaster Recovery for a computer installation. By ensuring that data updates are continuously replicated to a remote site in near-real time, that site can rapidly take over the provision of a service in the event that the entire primary site is lost as a result of a disaster, either natural or man-made. This is a key to minimizing the Recovery point objective (RPO) and Recovery time objective (RTO) for the service.  Proxy file system  PxFS (Proxy file system) is a distributed, high availability, POSIX compliant filesystem internal to Solaris Cluster nodes. Global devices in Sun Cluster are made possible by PxFS.  Supported applications  Solaris Cluster uses software components called agents which monitor an application to detect whether it is operating correctly, and take action if a problem is detected. Agents for common applications are included such as Siebel Systems, SAP Livecache, WebLogic Server, Sun Java Application Server, MySQL, Oracle RAC, Oracle E-Business Suite and Samba among others; there is also a wizard which allows the cluster implementer to create agents for other applications.

It was formed in 1990 from the merger of the Bank Officers’ Union and the Insurance Workers Union. In October 2011 Finsec amalgamated with the National Distribution Union to create a new union called First Union New Zealand. The majority of its members were located at the four big foreign owned banks in New Zealand; ASB, ANZ National Bank, BNZ and Westpac. However, it also covered legal employees, accountancy employees, stock and station employees and commerce workers, and a growing number of members work in call centres, information technology, communications and related industries. Finsec had offices in Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch. It was an affiliate of the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions (NZCTU) and Union Network International (UNI).

It was named after Eloise Dickerson Davock, St. Bernard the daughter of Detroit's postmaster. It operated from 1839 to early 1982. Starting out as a poor house and farm, it eventually developed into an asylum, sanatorium and hospital. In 1832 it was called the Wayne County Poorhouse; in 1872 it was the Wayne County Alms House; in 1886 it was referred to simply as the Wayne County House. In 1913 there were three divisions: The Eloise Hospital (Mental Hospital), the Eloise Infirmary (Poorhouse) and the Eloise Sanatorium (T.B. Hospital) which were collectively called Eloise. In 1945 it was named Wayne County General Hospital and Infirmary at Eloise, Michigan. In 1974 it had two divisions - the Wayne County General Hospital and the Wayne County Psychiatric Hospital. In 1979 it was officially called Wayne County General Hospital with the psychiatric division closing in 1982 . In its prime, Eloise consisted of 78 buildings on 902 acres with 10,000 patients along with 2,000 staff. It was the largest psychiatric facility in the United States. Unfortunately only 5 of the 78 buildings and the Eloise Cemetery remain. The firehouse, bakery, power plant, commissary and D buildings still stand as of February, 2019. The history of Eloise The Wayne County Poor House was founded in 1832. It was located at Gratiot and Mt. Elliott Avenues in Hamtramck Township two miles from the Detroit city limits. By 1834 the poorhouse was in bad condition and in Nankin Township were purchased. The Black Horse Tavern which served as a stagecoach stop between Detroit and Chicago was located on the property. In those days it was a two-day stagecoach ride from Hamtramck Township to Nankin Township. The register shows that on April 11, 1839 35 people were transferred from the poorhouse in Hamtramck Township to the new one in Nankin Township. 111 apparently refused to go to the \\"awful wilderness.\\" Many were children and homes among the residents of the city may have been found for them. The log cabin which was formerly the Black Horse Tavern became the keeper's quarters and in 1839 an A frame building was put up to house the inmates. An A frame cookhouse was erected in the back of the log building and was used for cooking by both inmates and the keeper's family. The complex was self-sufficient. It had its own police and fire departments along with a railroad and trolley system. It included a bakery, amusement hall, laundry facility, post office and a power plant. It had its own farm which included a dairy herd, dairy barns, piggery, root cellar, tobacco curing building and greenhouses. Patients came from Detroit and other communities to have x-rays done. It also housed the first kidney dialysis unit in the State of Michigan and pioneered the use of music therapy. Staff also used hydrotherapy, shock therapy and insulin therapy to treat patients. As the years went on the institution grew larger and larger, a reflection in the increases in the population of the Detroit area. From only 35 residents in 1839 the complex grew to about 10,000 residents at its peak during the Great Depression. Slowly over the next 40 years Eloise’s population decreased. The farm operations ceased in 1958 and some of the large psychiatric buildings were vacated in 1973. The psychiatric division started closing in 1977 with the last patients being transferred out in 1982 when the State of Michigan took over. The general hospital closed in 1986. Inventor Elijah McCoy may be its most famous former resident. He spent a year prior to his death as a patient in the Eloise Infirmary. There were other well-known people who died at Eloise including several baseball players. Among them are Jul Kustus, Larry LeJeune, Charlie Krause, and Marty Kavanagh. Musician Horace Flinders was also a patient, and received music therapy. Eloise present day Kay Beard Building Today the land that once was Eloise has been developed into a strip mall, a golf course, and condominiums. There are only two buildings currently in use. One is \\"D\\" Building or the Kay Beard Building. It was used for psychiatric admissions, housed 400 patients and had living quarters for some employees like the Catholic chaplain. Later it was used by Wayne County for administration until 2016. The old commissary building is currently being used as a family homeless shelter. The firehouse (former psychiatric facility laundry), and the power plant are still standing in decay. The bakery was heavily damaged due to arson in April 2016, with charred ruins still standing as of February 16, 2019 (however, there are plans to raze and remove the remainder). The Eloise smokestack emblazoned Eloise in brick was deemed to be a hazard and was demolished in 2006. In 1979, the Walter P. Reuther Psychiatric Hospital, located near the northwest end of the former Eloise property, just southeast of the intersection of Merriman and Palmer Roads, was opened. The facility is currently operated by the Michigan Department of Community Health. In 1996, Oakwood Health System opened an outpatient facility, the Adams Child & Adolescent Health Center, on the corner of Merriman and Palmer near Reuther Hospital. Both facilities have Palmer Road addresses. Eloise is featured in the book Annie's Ghosts: A Journey Into a Family Secret by Steve Luxenberg, which is about Luxenberg's secret aunt who was committed to the Eloise psychiatric hospital in the 1940s.See photo in Eloise: Poorhouse, Farm, Asylum and Hospital, page 109 The site is marked by a Michigan Historic Marker. The site and the adjoining Eloise Cemetery are reputed to be haunted. >url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509093607/http://www.hauntingamerica.com/wayne- county-poor-house-eloise-asylum/ archive-date=May 9, 2014 url-status=dead }} In popular culture It also inspired the horror movie Eloise. The film stars Eliza Dushku, Robert Patrick, Chace Crawford, Brandon T. Jackson, Nicole Forester, and P. J. Byrne. The film was released on February 3, 2017, by Vertical Entertainment.

It is readily identifiable from the flatlands of the South Bay, as it is the only \\"naked\\" part of the peninsula range (not forested). The Windy Hill Preserve comprises an important 1132 acre (4.6 km2) stretch of conservation land on the eastward side of the Peninsula Range (Santa Cruz Mountains), rising from the valley road near Portola Valley to the 1905 ft (581 m) summit from which it gets its name. Access to the summit is easy (0.5 mile moderate grade) from State Route 35, the ridge road along the Peninsula Range. Facilities focus on trails for hiking and mountain biking, with around 14 miles (22 km) of hiking trails. Paragliding and hang gliding are permitted with a special use permit, and are popular activities in the winter months when there are East winds. In clear weather there are magnificent views from the summit, and indeed the entire upper end of the park, across the campus of Stanford University to the San Francisco Bay and beyond to Mount Tamalpais and Mount Diablo. Downtown San Francisco is visible, as well as the Pacific Ocean. Most of Windy Hill is sheltered from the prevailing weather, which comes in off of the Pacific Ocean. A nice day further down can be very cold, windy, foggy or rainy at the summit. The area is rich in wildlife; among the species likely to be seen are California mule deer, coyote, California vole, white- tailed kite, American kestrel, band-tailed pigeon and California quail. There are signs warning about mountain lions, but bobcats are more common. Rattlesnakes and gopher snakes may also be found. Banana slugs and, in season, California newts are common. Spring Ridge Trail runs from the Portola Valley trailhead to Skyline Boulevard through the open, grassy part of the preserve. It, like most of the lower trails, is a fire road, open to cyclists as well as hikers and equestrians. Two trails further to the south (Hamms Gulch and the Lost Trail-Razorback Ridge-Eagle Trail combination), are single-tracks not open to cyclists. These trails run through forested country: oak, fir, buckeye, bay laurel, madrone and one or two redwoods. Because the far shore rises so steeply, Sausal Pond appears to be black or murky green, rather than sky-blue. This marshy pond is home to a few coots and the occasional mallard, to dragonflies and bullfrogs. Shoreline access is limited to not more than one or two hundred feet, much of that surrounded by bush and accessible only to the determined.

The soprano recorder in c2, also known as the descant, is the third-smallest instrument of the modern recorder family and is usually played as the highest voice in four- part ensembles (SATB = soprano, alto, tenor, bass). Since its finger spacing is relatively small, it is often used in music education for children first learning to play an instrument. Voice The soprano recorder is an octave above the level of the human soprano voice. Its lowest note is c2 (this article is notated using Helmholtz notation, in scientific pitch notation the same note is represented as C5), the normal range is c2–d4. Compositions for soprano recorder are usually notated an octave lower than they sound. Its timbre is similar to the sound of the flue pipes of an organ, which is why some organ stops sound similar to a recorder. These registers are called then block-flute or forest-flute. Fingerings In addition to the traditional \\"Baroque\\" (or \\"English\\") fingering, which was created in Haslemere in 1919 by Arnold Dolmetsch soprano recorders have been made that make use of \\"German\\" fingering, which was introduced by Peter Harlan around 1926. In German fingering the note f2 is playable with a simpler fingering than the Baroque technique's forked (or cross-) fingering. However, German fingering has been described as a \\"step backwards ... made on the false assumption that the instrument would be easier for schoolchildren\\". The disadvantage is that other, unavoidable cross-fingerings become more difficult . Material Recorders with a plastic head joint or made completely of plastic are widely used. Soprano recorders are made from various woods such as maple, pear, boxwood, rosewood, olive, African blackwood, \\"rosewood\\", or ebony.

It would have been Australia's first nuclear power plant, and was the only proposal to have received serious consideration . Some environmental studies and site works were completed, and two rounds of tenders were called and evaluated, but the Australian government decided not to proceed with the project. Background to the project In 1969 the Australian government proposed to the New South Wales government that a 500 MWe nuclear power station should be built on Commonwealth territory and connected to the New South Wales grid, electricity generation and distribution being a state responsibility under the Australian constitution. Possible sites were the Australian Capital Territory and Jervis Bay. The plan, supported by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, was for a design of reactor that could generate weapons-grade plutonium, possibly reflecting Australia's long-term post-World War II interest in acquiring nuclear weapons.Ian Holland, 'Radioactive Waste and Spent Nuclear Fuel Management in Australia', Chronology No. 1 2003–04, Department of the Parliamentary Library, 2003, p. 9. In December 1969 invitations to express interest in the construction of a nuclear power plant at Jervis Bay were sent to fourteen organisations. Tender documents were issued the following February, with tenders closing the following June. Fourteen tenders were received from seven different organisations. About 70 staff were involved full-time in evaluating tenders, principally from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, and more than 150 others had a significant part-time role. As a result, a recommendation was written for the acceptance of the tender to supply a 600 MWe Steam generating heavy water reactor (SGHWR), from the British organisation The Nuclear Power Group. The abandonment of the proposal Before this recommendation was made, however, there was a change of prime minister (although not of government). John Gorton had been a supporter of the project. However, he was replaced as Prime Minister by William McMahon. McMahon opposed the nuclear power program, and the project was deferred for a year, citing financial constraints – Treasury prepared the first comprehensive comparative cost analysis in 1971 and concluded that nuclear was going to be far more expensive than a conventional coal plant.Ian Hancock, John Gorton: He Did It His Way, Hodder, 2002'Gorton gave nod to nuclear power plant', The Age, 1 January 2000.'Classic stoush the sub-text to nuclear plan', The Canberra Times, 1 January 2000. Following the discovery of natural gas and oil in Bass Strait, and the development of economic coal resources, most of the energy security incentive had evaporated. Tenders were re-called, only to be again deferred and in practical terms cancelled in June 1971. Organisations like the World Union for Protection of Life, the Ecology Action and the Society for Responsibility in Science had reported about the dangers connected with the nuclear power plant. Some land clearing was done in preparation for the construction, and concrete footings were installed. The footings are visible to this day.

He was involved in the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919, and subsequently ran for office as a candidate of the Labour Party. Tipping's personal beliefs were strongly influenced by the English socialist Robert Blatchford. He was a founder of the Social Democratic Party of Canada in 1911, and was a prominent social democrat in Winnipeg's north end during the 1910s. Distinguishing the SDP from the more doctrinaire Socialist Party of Canada, he once wrote that \\"the doctrinal body is liable to use terminology that is peculiar to itself, [but] the language of the social democrat tended to be more the language of the street\\"(1). Tipping was elected to the Winnipeg trades council during this period, and helped to form in the Dominion Labour Party in 1918. Tipping holds the unique distinction of being the only teacher to participate in the Winnipeg General Strike. He taught shop classes, and so was a member of the Winnipeg carpenter's union. When the strike was called, he believed it was his duty to support the workers. He was still paid by the Winnipeg School Board throughout the strike. After the strike was suppressed, Tipping was arrested for addressing an open air meeting in defiance of a Winnipeg by-law. He was released later when it was shown that the address had actually taken place in the neighbouring community of Fort Garry. Tipping was later sent by the Strike Committee to Ottawa, to petition the federal government for a jury trial for other strikers arrested on charges of seditious conspiracy. In the 1920 provincial election, Tipping ran in the Winnipeg constituency as part of a \\"united labour\\" slate. At the time, Winnipeg elected ten members by a single transferable ballot. Although the labour slate did well overall, Tipping finished 36th on the first count and was eliminated on the sixteenth count. He remained active with the labour movement and socialist parties after this period. He joined the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, and ran for the party in the 1945 federal election in Winnipeg South. He received 9,033 votes, finishing a credible third behind Liberal Leslie Alexander Mutch. He ran again in the 1949 election, with the same result. Tipping was nominated for the CCF nomination again in the 1953 provincial election, but declined. References (1) A.

The A is rare, but even less common, obsolete instruments in high C, B, and A (an octave above the more common instruments in those keys) are listed by Shackleton. Some writers call the A and these other instruments octave clarinets, sopranino clarinets, or piccolo clarinets. The boundary between the octave and soprano clarinets is not well-defined, and the rare instruments in G and F might be considered as either. Shackleton, along with many early twentieth-century composers, uses the term \\"piccolo clarinet\\" to refer to the E and D clarinets as well (piccolo merely meaning \\"small\\" in Italian). This designation is less common today, with the E and D instruments more usually designated soprano clarinets. The term \\"piccolo clarinet\\" is used by some recent music software (e.g., Finale) for the A clarinet. The A clarinet is pitched a minor seventh higher than the B clarinet. Its lowest note, E, sounds as concert middle C, the same as many concert flutes. Clarinets pitched in A appeared frequently in European wind bands, particularly in Spain and Italy, at least through the middle of the 20th century, and are called for in the stage-band parts for several operas by Verdi.Basil Tschaikov, \\"The high clarinets,\\" in Colin Lawson, The Cambridge companion to the clarinet, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), pp. 52-55. Cecil Forsyth associated the high instruments with Austria saying, \\"Clarinets in (high) F, and even in (high) A are occasionally used abroad. The latter instrument is regularly employed in the Austrian military bands.\\"Forsyth, Orchestration, second edition, p. 281 (Dover Reprint) A famous example of extensive use of a high clarinet in a Viennese small ensemble was the Schrammel quartet, consisting of two violins (the brothers Johann and Josef Schrammel), a bass guitar, and G clarinet, played by Georg Dänzer, during the 1880s. Size comparison among the A, E, and B clarinets The A clarinet is not uncommon in clarinet choir arrangements—for instance, those of Lucien Cailliet, including Mozart's Marriage of Figaro overture—though the instrument is often optional or cued in other voices. There are parts for A clarinet in Béla Bartók's Scherzo for Piano and Orchestra, op. 2 (\\"mostly in unison with the E or piccolo [flute]\\") and in John Tavener's Celtic Requiem (1969). Several chamber works of Hans-Joachim Hespos employ the A clarinet, including the wild go which also features soprano sarrusophone, heckelphone, and tárogató. Hespos also uses the A clarinet in the orchestral work Interactions. Matthijs Vermeulen's Symphony Nr. 4 has a part for A clarinet.

History Kampfgruppe 1001 Nights was formed from the guards at the V-2 launch sites in March 1945. Three companies of V-2 guards arrived at the German Ninth Army HQ on the Oder river in early March, 1945. Simultaneously, three companies of Hetzer panzerjäger from the 560th SS Tank Destroyer Battalion, which had been used for training purposes, were sent to join Army Group Vistula on the Oder front. General Theodor Busse, Ninth Army's commander, decided to form these troops into a Kampfgruppe which could be used as a mobile reserve. Major Gustav-Adolf Blancbois was placed in command. Soon after its formation, a motorcycle company and several anti-tank guns, armoured cars and a company of StuG III assault guns from the 27th SS Volunteer Division Langemarck were added to the Kampfgruppe. The Kampfgruppe's strength was about 500 infantry and 43 serviceable armoured vehicles. The Kampfgruppe was divided into three combat formations, named Suleika, Harem and Sultan. Suleika was commanded by Sturmbannführer Wost and later by Haupsturmführer Markowz with a staff, a supply company, three Jagdpanzer-Kompanien with 14 Hetzer each and a fourth with Sturmgeschütze and back up recovery tanks. On 27 March, the Kampfgruppe was ordered into action near the town of Genschmar, in an attempt to reduce the Red Army's bridgehead over the Oder, which it failed to do. On 16 April, the battle of Seelow Heights began as the Red Army attacked the German defensive lines on the Oder. The Kampfgruppe was sent with the 25th Panzergrenadier Division and the 111th StuG-Lehr Brigade to support the 606th Infantry Division near the town of Wriezen. The Germans were driven back, with the Kampfgruppe reduced to 18 functioning armoured vehicles and 50 men. The Kampfgruppe was dissolved near Müncheberg during the withdrawal to Berlin. Its remnants were encircled and destroyed in the Halbe pocket; few of its men survived the war. One exception was Blancbois himself, who, along with a small number of his men, escaped to the west and surrendered to the Americans on the Elbe.

Outdoor emergency care technicians provide care at ski resorts, wilderness settings, white-water excursions, mountain bike events, and in many other outdoor environments. Basic emergency skills taught include using airway adjuncts, assisting patients with medications, splinting and bandaging, providing emergency care for environmental illnesses and injuries, using special equipment and techniques particular to non-urban rescuers, and managing prolonged transport.  Training  The standard of training and actual procedures and requirements for OEC meet and exceed those of the first responder basic course and the curriculum contains many of the skills identified in the US Department of Transportation (DOT) 1994 EMT-Basic National Standard Curriculum, although training is specific to needs in outdoor scenarios, such as self-reliance and individual skills. This instead of the EMT curriculum focusing on urban environments with immediate access to additional resources such as EMT partners and an ambulance. While the OEC curriculum includes a skill set and fund of knowledge that exceeds those of the emergency medical responder (EMR) program, it does not include all the knowledge needed for an EMT program since it emphasizes caring for patients in the wilderness, with a focus on snow- sports pathology. Because of this, OEC technicians typically have a similar standards of training compared to EMT-basic responders, albeit several different focuses of the training: with OEC devoting a larger portion of the curriculum to musculoskeletal injuries, splinting, bandaging, and environmental emergencies and devoting comparatively less time on patients with a medical based issue. OEC technicians are first responders, not definitive medical care, and have the knowledge to care for, transport, and treat patients, but not to diagnose them or provide terminal support or invasive therapies. OEC technician training focuses primarily on assessing and treating immediate life threats to the patients' airway, breathing and circulation; stabilizing the patient; and transporting them (if necessary) to rendezvous with equal or higher levels of medical care, especially an ambulance. Based on severity, the OEC technician will often manage secondary concerns either before transporting (most common), or while waiting for rendezvous. These typically include fractures, sprains, bleeding, head injuries, and medical concerns including anaphylaxis, acute myocardial infarction, and hypoglycemia (diabetes). The scope of practice of the OEC technician is entirely basic life support and non-invasive. It is determined for each operating agency (most often a local ski patrol) by a local medical director, most typically a physician, and effected through protocols, standing orders, and off-line medical direction. Most often, the OEC technician is unable to consult with a physician medical director to receive on-line instructions, unlike an EMT, so they follow already established local protocols. Protocols and standing orders may differ slightly from the OEC standards of training, but maximally, may include the following: Use of external airway adjuncts, namely the OPA and NPA. Manual and mechanical airway suctioning. Dislodging of foreign body airway obstructions through heimlich maneuver and visible finger sweeps. Airway positioning using head-tilt chin- lift and jaw-thrust maneuvers. BLS cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Automated external defibrillation using the AED. Application of up to 100% oxygen therapy via non-rebreather mask or nasal cannula. Positive-pressure ventilation using a bag valve mask device. Use of body substance isolation, assessing and maintaining scene safety, assessing level of responsiveness, including Glasgow coma scale. Controlling external bleeding through application of direct pressure, elevation, hemostatic dressings, and tourniquets. Application of occlusive dressings, bulky dressings, et cetera. Obtaining medical histories, physical, and neurological assessments. Documentation of medical situations. Obtaining and subjective interpretation of vital signs including blood pressure, blood-oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate, respirations, eye and skin signs, and lung sounds through auscultation. Eye irrigation. Application of soft and rigid splints to all body parts, and assessing distal neurovascular functions. Initiation and application of triage. Reducing a posterior sternoclavicular dislocation. Relieving pressure from a subungual hematoma. Maintaining manual, in-line stabilization of the spine, including long spine board immobilization and application of a cervical collar. Seated spinal immobilization, including use of the kendrick extrication device. Application of a traction splint. Assisting in the uncomplicated delivery of an infant, including managing conditions such as nuchal cord, prolapsed cord, and breech delivery. Recognizing and providing supportive care to common medical ailments including medical shock, anaphylaxis, diabetic emergencies, environmental emergencies, cardiac emergencies, et cetera. Assisting patients in administration of certain patient-provided, already-prescribed medications including an albuterol metered-dose inhaler, epinephrine autoinjector, and nitroglycerin. Assisting administration of certain over-the-counter drugs to patients, including aspirin to patients suspected of AMI, oral glucose to hypoglycemic patients, and activated charcoal to patients having ingested poisonous substances. Drugs within the scope of practice of OEC include adrenaline, albuterol, nitroglycerin, oral glucose gel, activated charcoal, aspirin for AMI, and oxygen therapy. In general, the patient must provide their own medications, already prescribed by a physician, in order to be assisted with them by the OEC technician. This is partially due to the fact that the OEC technician does not have access to the prescription controlled drugs epinephrine, albuterol, or nitroglycerin; thus they must be provided by the patient. These are medications typically carried by patients in most situations. In addition, the technician may not administer these medications to the patient, but may simply assist the patient in taking it themselves. This includes identifying the appropriate situation in which to do so. The degree to which the technicians' help constitutes assisting is vaguely defined, and it is thus is considered that the OEC technician is given a wide berth of discretion in this regard. The rule regarding patients providing their own medications does not apply to the \\"drugs\\" oral glucose, activated charcoal, aspirin, or oxygen as the first two are not pharmacologically active; aspirin and oxygen have very few contraindications; they are not prescription controlled (except medical oxygen, which is not prescribed per patient, but rather per institution); and none are typically carried by patients. Thus, the OEC technician typically has access to these four interventions and may assist in their administration as warranted. Technicians must attend annual OEC refresher courses in order to maintain their certification. The OEC refreshers cover 1/3 of the OEC curriculum each year which cycles through the entire course every three years. OEC technicians are trained to understand medical, legal and ethical issues, to use innovative methods to perform their tasks, and to be mindful of consent and refusal of care. OEC technicians are able to effectively interface with the next level of care for their patients, usually ambulances with other EMTs and paramedics; and rarely hospitals.

Early life Valdes was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Her father, Nelson Valdés, is a retired sociology professor at the University of New Mexico, and emigrated from Cuba in the early 1960s. Her mother, Maxine Conant, is a seventh-generation New Mexican of mixed heritage, including Spanish, Mexican, French Jewish, Native American and Irish ancestry, with English lines tracing directly back to Roger Conant, founder of Salem, Massachusetts, and Vermont revolutionary Ethan Allen. Ms. Conant is an award- winning poet and novelist.http://alisavaldes.com/bio Valdes spent her childhood primarily in New Mexico, but also lived briefly in Glasgow, Scotland and New Orleans. Upon her graduation from Del Norte High School in Albuquerque she attended Berklee College of Music in Boston where she majored in jazz performance on the tenor saxophone. Journalism career While a student at Berklee, Valdes began writing freelance music reviews for The Boston Globe. After graduating from Berklee in 1992, she took an unpaid internship at the Village Voice, before going back to school to earn a master's degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1994. Valdes joined the staff of The Boston Globe in 1994, where she wrote for the Living/Arts section. Her essay for The Boston Globe Magazine, \\"Daughter of Cuba,\\" won first place in the 1998 SUNMAG essay contest. In 1999, Valdes left Boston for a position as staff writer in the Calendar section of the Los Angeles Times. Her articles have appeared in dozens of newspapers, and she has written cover stories for Glamour and Redbook. Valdes continues to work in journalism, writing a weekly parenting column for the website \\"Mamiverse\\", an opinion piece for NBC Latino, a travel piece for London newspaper The Guardian, and contributing posts for The Huffington Post Books section. Literary career Her first novel, The Dirty Girls Social Club, was purchased by St. Martin's Press a little more than a year after she left the Los Angeles Times. She was paid an advance of $475,000 after five publishing houses bid for the manuscript.http://alisavaldesrodriguez.blogspot.com/2008/02/gains-losses-and- luck.html In a profile of the writer, entitled \\"The Latina Terry McMillan?\\", Chicago Tribune reporter Patrick T. Reardon wrote: \\"What made [the book] especially hot was the belief among publishers that Valdes-Rodriguez could be the long-sought 'Latina Terry McMillan' -- a writer whose work would jump- start Hispanic book buying in the U.S. and create a new profitable publishing niche...\\" The Dirty Girls Social Club garnered media attention and went on to become a New York Times bestseller and a Booksense 76 top pick. Booksense Pick List 2003 Valdes has since written twelve novels: Playing With Boys in 2004; Make Him Look Good in 2006; a young adult novel, Haters, in 2006; Dirty Girls on Top, a sequel to The Dirty Girls Social Club, in 2008, The Husband Habit in 2009, and The Three Kings in 2010, All That Glitters in 2011, Lauren's Saints of Dirty Faith in 2011, The Temptation in 2012, Puta in 2013, The Temptation of Demetrio Vigil in 2013, and the short romance ebooks Billy, the Man; A Better Love Than Husband, and Forgive Me My Sins, all in 2013. Valdes wrote a memoir, The Feminist and the Cowboy: An Unlikely Love Story, published in 2013. The book detailed her relationship with a conservative ranch hand and how it led her to rethink some of her feminist beliefs. After its publication, Valdes alleged that the relationship was abusive. In 2005, Time dubbed Valdes \\"The Godmother of Chica Lit\\" and named her one of the 25 most influential Hispanics in the United States. Hispanic Business Magazine has twice named her among the 100 Most Influential Hispanics in America. In 2006, the Hispanic Congressional Caucus awarded Valdes with a Latina Leadership award, and she participated in the National Book Festival at the Library of Congress. She also received the Theatre of Hearts \\"Youth First\\" award in Los Angeles in 2004. Film career Before its publication in 2003, the film rights to The Dirty Girls Social Club were optioned by Columbia Pictures with Jennifer Lopez and Laura Ziskin as producers, but the option expired without going into production. The Lifetime Television network then began to develop the book as a television series. The project did not progress beyond development. Valdes next partnered with Nely Galán's Cienfuegos Films company, to make an independent film based upon the novel, with Valdes, Galán and Debra Martin Chase as executive producers and Valdes as creator and screenwriter, but the deal never came to pass. Ann Lopez, ex-wife of comedian George Lopez, optioned The Dirty Girls Social Club in 2009. NBC was developing the novel with Lopez and her company Encanto Productions for the 2011-2012 television season. In December 2010, Valdes publicly accused Ann Lopez and screenplay writer Luisa Leschin of racism and homophobia after reading a draft of their proposed pilot script. She later retracted some of her statements about Lopez and Leschin, while maintaining her displeasure with the script. NBC ultimately did not order a pilot of The Dirty Girls Social Club. Valdes formed her own production company, Valdes Entertainment Enterprises , in 2013 to develop The Dirty Girls Social Club for film. Valdes teamed up with television producers MarVista Entertainment to help produce the film.http://alisavaldes.com/author-alisa- valdes-inks-film-deal-marvista-entertainment/ BibliographyNovels= *The Dirty Girls Social Club (2003) *Playing with Boys (2004) *Make Him Look Good (2006) *Haters (2006) *Dirty Girls on Top (2008) *The Husband Habit (2010) *All That Glitters (2011) *The Three Kings (2010) *Laurens Saints of Dirty Faith (2011) *The Temptation (2012) *Puta (2012) *The Temptation of Demetrio Vigil (2013) =Novelitas= *Lauren's Very Dirty Chapter (2012) *Billy, the Man (2012) *Better Lover Than a Husband (2013) *Forgive Me My Sins (2013) =Anthologies= *Girls Night In (2004) *Girls Night Out (anthology) (2006) *Maybe Baby (anthology) (2006) =Memoirs= *The Feminist and the Cowboy (2013)  See also  *List of Cuban American writers *List of Cuban Americans ReferencesExternal links * Official website *Valdes Entertainment Enterprises LLC website Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American novelists Category:American women novelists Category:American writers of Cuban descent Category:American chick lit writers Category:Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism alumni Category:Writers from Albuquerque, New Mexico Category:Hispanic and Latino American novelists Category:21st-century American women writers Category:Berklee College of Music alumni ","title":"Alisa Valdes"},{"id":"2471715","text":"Craig Mottram (born 18 June 1980) is a former Australian long and middle- distance runner who specialises in the 5000 meter event. Early years Mottram was born on 18 June 1980 in Frankston, Victoria. He attended Geelong Grammar School. =Career= At 6 feet 2 inches, Mottram is unusually tall for a distance runner. He competed in his first Olympic Games at only 20 years of age, in the 5000 metre event at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney: he did not qualify from his heat, but finished in 8th place with a respectable time of 13 minutes, 31.06 seconds. He fared better in his next Olympic competition: with four additional years of experience and athletic maturity, Mottram qualified for the final of the 5000 metre event and finished 8th with a time of 13:25.70 in Athens. In 2005, he set a course record to win the Great Ireland Run in a third consecutive win at the competition. On 14 August 2005, he reached a career highlight, coming third in the 5000 m event at the 2005 World Championships in Athletics in Helsinki, running the event in 13 minutes, 32.96 seconds. He is the only non-African born runner to receive a medal in that event since 1987. On 9 March 2006 in Melbourne, in his final warmup event before the 2006 Commonwealth Games, Mottram took ten seconds off the 12-year- old Australian record for the 2000 metres. This distance, not often run at IAAF events, was scheduled specifically to suit Mottram's Games preparation. On 20 March 2006 at the Commonwealth Games, Mottram came second in the 5000 m event with a time of 12 minutes, 58.19 seconds, beaten narrowly by Kenyan runner Augustine Choge. This race was only the second time that this event was won in under 13 minutes at a championship competition (first one being 2003 World Athletics Championships.) Mottram also ran in the 1500 m event in Melbourne on 25 March 2006, entering the competition as favourite to win. Having worked his way into third position during the race, Mottram was accidentally tripped at the 800-metre mark when English athlete Andrew Baddeley fell behind him, clipping Mottram's heel. Mottram lost 20 metres on the field due to the incident and finished in ninth position. In June 2006 Mottram set the Parkrun 5 km world record time with 14 minutes and 0 seconds at Bushy Parkrun, he held the record until 2012. He is a supporter of English Premier League club Sunderlandhttps://web.archive.org/web/20071222004315/http://www.ukathletics.net/tvevents/news/article-27/ and ran in the Great North Run 2006, wearing a Sunderland shirt. On 21 December 2006, Mottram set the record for the Tan in a time of 10:08:00. The Tan is Melbourne's most iconic running track, located around the Royal Botanic Gardens. Mottram beat the previous best time of 10:12, also his own, during a Richmond Tigers Football Club trial. In 2007 Mottram started the year on a high, dominating \\"the Kenyan Hope\\" of Boniface Songkok at the Telstra A series in Melbourne. The race was a conservative one before Craig tore the field open with a quick 7th lap before a devastating final 400 m run in 53 seconds. At the Prefontaine Classic In Eugene (Oregon), Craig ran the 5th fastest 2-mile of all time in 8:03.50 leaving in his wake the likes Alan Webb, Tariku Bekele, Matt Tegenkemp, Dathan Ritzenhein and other American hopefuls. \\"It comes down to the size of your balls,\\" Mottram said of his ability to pick up the pace and shake off his rivals in Oregon. After a good start to the season Craig suffered a hamstring strain. This affected his training for the World Championships, where he finished 11th. 2008 was an up-and-down season for Mottram. He won the Melbourne Grand Prix 5000 m and the National Championship 5000 m and 3000 m. He then competed at the 2008 Indoor Championships in Valencia, where he placed 5th in the final. He then contested the Boston Indoor Grand Prix where he won the 3000 m and broke the meet record of Haile Gebrselassie. He hit form after he won the Stockholm Grand Prix 3000 m and placed 4th in the 1 Mile. He also ran a 3:57.90-mile finishing 2nd to Bernard Lagat at the prestigious Millrose games in February 2008. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Mottram placed 5th in the first heat of the 5000 m in 13min 44.39sec and did not advance to the final. Following this disappointment, Mottram split from coach Nick Bideau, choosing to self-coach. Due to injuries, he did not compete in the 2009 IAAF World Championships in Athletics in Berlin. That year, after having run for Nike for all of his professional career, Mottram signed a contract with Adidas. He also accepted a coaching offer from Australian distance running coach Chris Wardlaw, who has coached marathon runner Steve Moneghetti among others.http://www.runblogrun.com/2009/02/craig_mottram_to_run_for_adida_1.html In late November 2009 Craig Mottram made a return from his 12-month absence from racing, clocking 13 minutes and 23 seconds in the opening 5 km leg of the Chiba Ekiden Relay in Japan. This performance put his Australian team in first place, before they dropped to 7th. His time of 13:23 was just outside the event record. In the 2010 season he won the Great Yorkshire Run in Sheffield, beating home favourite Chris Thompson to the line by just one second.Mills, Steven (5 September 2010). Murray defends Yorkshire 10km title . Athletics Weekly. Retrieved on 6 September 2010. He beat Chris Thompson again on 18 September 2010 by one second in a close finish at the Great North City Games 2-mile event in 8.31. In August 2012 Craig Mottram competed in the London Olympics 5000m for Australia. He was the fastest Australian at those Olympics, with a 13.40, but was unable to make it into the final.

In Japan, it is commonly used as a garnish in soups or atop entrees or as a sushi ingredient. The white stems are blanched while they're tender, and have a taste similar to coriander. Two main regional varieties exist, the green Kansai type, and the white Kantō type. Nutritional benefits Mitsuba's dark green leaves, stems, and pods have an extensive nutritional profile, including high levels of calcium and vitamin C.

Plot summary In it, the players controlled neophyte superheroes looking to apply for membership in the Crusaders, an esteemed team of superheroes. The Crusaders roster consisted of: Manta Man, their leader, whose wife was killed by pirates and to exact revenge he built a costume that gave him the power to fly, breathe underwater and emit blasts of electricity. Enforcer, a secret agent who betrayed his agency and saved a scientist who had developed a secret formula. Drinking the formula, he gained the ability to generate force fields. Enforcer also uses a specialized pistol. Dreamweaver, a college student who gained the power to create illusions or become invisible from a dream research experiment. Laserfire, a teenager who gained powers of heat and light when he was caught in the thrust of an alien spacecraft taking off nearby. Evergreen, part woman, part plant, and able to mentally control vegetation. At the time of the module, she does not know her true origins. Blizzard, a comic book fan who decided to follow the lead of his print heroes when he developed his power to create ice. The players need to contend with the Crusaders' opposite numbers during the adventure, a villain group called the Crushers. A few of its members include Mocker, a robot able to fire sonic blasts, Mercury Mercenary, a soldier of fortune with superhuman speed and Enforcer's personal archenemy, Shocker, who has acidic blood and electric blasts and yearns to have Evergreen's love as well, and Marionette, a midget who can control minds. Legacy Four years after the adventure booklet was published, Eclipse Comics published a four issue mini series based on the characters. The comic books included supplemental material to show the growth of the Crusaders and Crushers in the years between. Reception William A.

The event registered 7.2 on the moment magnitude scale. Earthquake characteristics USGS ShakeMap for the August 2005 Miyagi earthquake The earthquake occurred on Tuesday, August 16, 2005, and affected Japan's northeastern coast. It triggered a tsunami warning, and buildings shook 200 miles away in the capital, Tokyo. It was initially estimated to have a moment magnitude of 6.8, and the United States Geological Survey later declared it as a 7.2. Damage and casualties A tsunami warning was initially raised by the Japan Meteorological Agency, but was lifted after only two small waves several centimeters high hit shore. Casualties included those killed because of a pool roof collapse in Sendai city, Miyagi prefecture. Initial reports indicated 80 people were injured, but it was later reported by state broadcaster NHK that one person was seriously hurt and thirteen were slightly injured. Seventeen thousand people lost power. Twenty percent of the world's earthquakes are centered on Japan. The Japanese have been developing systems for early warning of earthquakes. For people of the city of Sendai who were testing the new earthquake warning system, they received a warning of the earthquake from the Meteorological Agency 16 seconds before it reached the city, providing time to take cover. People in Tokyo received a message one minute before it hit. Such technology has since become much more popular and this quake is credited for that, since it was 60 miles off the coast of Japan and there was time for a warning. Aftermath Business resumed within a day. Japan's Earthquake Research committee said that the earthquake was not the big one that was predicted to strike in the next 30 years.

The series centers on a team of superheroes created through genetic engineering by the Matrix Corporation to act as superhuman enforcers for the head of the company. Publication history Both Marvel Comics and DC Comics expressed interest in publishing The DNAgents, but Evanier and Meugniot decided against signing with them because they would have had to give up the TV and merchandising rights, and since both Evanier and Meugniot had extensive backgrounds and contacts in the television industry, they were confident that they would be able to sell DNAgents as a TV series without help from a publisher. Mike Friedrich served as an agent for Evanier and Meugniot, submitting The DNAgents to five different publishers. When all five offered to publish it, they decided on Eclipse Comics, a large independent publisher, for the amount of creative freedom they were ready to allow and for their strong plan for promoting the series.

It is located on a 3.57 square kilometre government reservation at Napot Point in Morong, Bataan. It was the Philippines' only attempt at building a nuclear power plant. It was mothballed due to safety concerns in the wake of the 1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant disaster in the former Soviet Ukraine and issues regarding corruption. Background The Philippine nuclear program started in 1958 with the creation of the Philippine Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) under Republic Act 2067. Under a regime of martial law, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos in July 1973 announced the decision to build a nuclear power plant. A presidential committee was set up to secure funding for two 620 megawatt nuclear reactors for the energy needs of Luzon. This was in response to the 1973 oil crisis, as the Middle East oil embargo had put a heavy strain on the Philippine economy, and Marcos believed nuclear power to be the solution to meeting the country's energy demands and decreasing dependence on imported oil.ABS-CBN News. (2007). ABS-CBN Interactive Retrieved 2007-06-13. In 2012, the Sandiganbayan graft court ordered entrepreneur and Marcos associate Herminio Disini to repay the Philippine government the amount of $50 million for his role in defrauding the country through the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant.  Controversy  Two proposals were submitted by General Electric and Westinghouse Electric. General Electric submitted a proposal containing detailed specifications of the nuclear plant and estimated it to cost US$700 million. On the other hand, Westinghouse submitted a lower cost estimate of US$500 million, but the proposal did not contain any detail or specification. The presidential committee tasked to oversee the project preferred General Electric's proposal, but this was overruled by Marcos in June 1974 who signed a letter of intent awarding the project to Westinghouse, despite the absence of any specifications on their proposal. Similarly, Marcos disregarded wishes and advice of the National Power Corporation, the government owned and controlled corporation responsible for electricity in the country. The project was plagued with problems throughout construction including location, welding, cabling, pipes and valves, permits, and kickbacks, as well as setbacks such as the decline of Marcos's influence and the incident at the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor. By March 1975, Westinghouse's cost estimate ballooned to US$1.2 billion without much explanation. The final cost was $2.2 billion for a single reactor producing half the power of the original proposal. Many problems identified in earlier stages remained throughout construction, as reported by inspectors though denied by Westinghouse.  Construction  Construction on the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant began in 1976. Following the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the United States, construction on the BNPP was stopped, and a subsequent safety inquiry into the plant revealed over 4,000 defects. Among the issues raised was that it was built near a major geological fault line and close to the then dormant Mount Pinatubo. By 1984, when the BNPP was nearly complete, its cost had reached $US2.3 billion. Equipped with a Westinghouse light water reactor, it was designed to produce 621 megawatts of electricity. President Ferdinand Marcos was overthrown by the People Power Revolution in February 1986. Days after the April 1986 Chernobyl disaster in what was then the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the succeeding administration of President Corazon Aquino decided not to operate the plant. Among other considerations taken were the strong opposition from Bataan residents and Philippine citizens as well as concern over the integrity of the construction. The government sued Westinghouse for alleged overpricing and bribery but was ultimately rejected by a United States court.Goodno, James. (1993-07-24). Fossil fuel plans for nuclear station. New Scientist Retrieved 2009-10-21 Debt repayment on the plant became the country's biggest single obligation. While successive governments have looked at several proposals to convert the plant into an oil, coal, or gas-fired power station, these options have all been deemed less economically attractive in the long term than simply constructing new power stations. =Opposition= The Bataan Nuclear Power Plant was a focal point for anti-nuclear protests in the late 1970s and 1980s. The project was criticised for being a potential threat to public health, especially since the plant was located in an earthquake zoneLee, Yok-shiu F. and Alvin Y. So (1999).

According to the US Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center, several earthquakes have occurred on Mount Natib from 1951 to 2016. Following proposals submitted in 2017 by Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co. Ltd. and Russia's Rosatom to rehabilitate the plant, opposition to the nuclear plant also raised concerns related to safety and health issues, reliance on imported uranium, high waste, and the steep cost of decommissioning.  History 2000s= Despite never having been commissioned, the plant has remained intact, including the nuclear reactor, and has continued to be maintained. The Philippine government completed paying off its obligations on the plant in April 2007, more than 30 years after construction began. On January 29, 2008, Energy Secretary Angelo Reyes announced that an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) eight-man team led by Akira Omoto inspected the Bataan Nuclear power station on rehabilitation prospects. In preparing their report, the IAEA made two primary recommendations. First, the power plant's status must be thoroughly evaluated by technical inspections and economic evaluations conducted by a committed group of nuclear power experts with experience in preservation management. Second, the IAEA mission advised the Philippine government on the general requirements for starting its nuclear power program, stressing that the proper infrastructure, safety standards, and knowledge be implemented.Report, Staff. (2008-07-12). IAEA Advises Philippines on Next Steps for \\"Mothballed\\" NPP. International Atomic Energy Agency Retrieved 2009-10-21. The IAEA's role did not extend to assessing whether the power plant is usable or how much the plant may cost to rehabilitate. Critics of the Bataan Nuclear power plant at an assembly in a basketball court around the compound of the Morong Parish Church in 2009 Plans to reactivate the plant was questioned by critics, citing the need to consider people's safety, the plant's structural defects, the fact that the plant stands near a major earthquake fault, and the large sums of money the government would need to loan to revive the plant. Critics also alleged that the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant was being revived to become another source of government corruption. Opposition to the nuclear plant's revival came from Bataan and nearby provinces. =2010s= On February 1, 2010, NAPOCOR started evaluating the financial plan of Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), assessing that it may cost US$1 billion to rehabilitate the nuclear plant.World, Business.

In 2016, various senators along with a few media personnel inspected the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant for a possible bid to open it to for public use. Inspecting senators told media that the power plant was still in good condition. The Department of Energy was later given the go ahead to look into the plant's rehabilitation. At least one senator has cautioned against reviving the nuclear power plant and stressed the need to consult scientists on the issue. Citing risks associated with the presence of the Lubao Fault, an active earthquake fault running through the nearby Mt. Natib, scientists have advised against reviving the nuclear plant. However, officials from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology had declared the site of the plant is safe noting the facility's solid foundation and the dormancy of the nearby volcano Mount Natib. In an interview with CNN Philippines in April 2018, the Russian ambassador to the Philippines commented that he believed that revival of the plant would not be possible due to its outdated design. In contrast, Rosatom's vice president for Southeast Asia, Egor Simonov, stated that it would be possible to revive the plant, noting its \\"relatively good condition\\" despite decades of disuse. In late 2017, representatives from Russia's Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation and Slovenia's GEN Energija went to assess the plant and make recommendations for its rehabilitation. They estimated rehabilitation costs between $3 to 4 billion dollars and proposed steps for securing the necessary financing, drafting of relevant regulations & training of technical personnel. They also recommended that the government consider the construction of new nuclear power plants. In 2019, the Department of National Defense expressed its support for the revival of the nuclear power plant. The Philippine Nuclear Research Institute also urged the government to revive the power plant.

OverviewDevelopment= Early concept art of SpaceGodzilla The character was designed as a homage to the monster's hinted progenitor Biollante by incorporating tusks and a hissing roar reminiscent of the latter monster. Creature designer Shinji Nishikawa had initially envisioned SpaceGodzilla as a much more Western dragon-like creature with large fin-like wings on the back.David Milner, \\"Shinji Nishikawa Interview\\", Kaiju Conversations (December 1995) Other early designs for the proposed \\"Astrogodzilla\\" included it being an albino Godzilla with expensive wings, two tails, and the ability to fire an ice ray. Another design for SpaceGodzilla had the character be a quadruped or a much more Biollante-like monster commanding a horde of cosmic dragonflies. The final design bore greater resemblance to Godzilla's final form from the video game Super Godzilla, itself also designed by Nishikawa. Special effects artist Koichi Kawakita decided to incorporate crystals onto the SpaceGodzilla design, and added a prominent horn on the creature's head in order to hint at its power and imply it had radar abilities.David Milne, \\"Koichi Kawakita Interview I\\", Kaiju Conversations (December 1994) In its debut film, SpaceGodzilla's origins are left ambiguous, but it is theorized that it was born through Godzilla cells (transported into space either by Mothra or Biollante's spores) being exposed to the radiation of a black hole. SpaceGodzilla heads for Earth and traps Little Godzilla in a crystalline prison, before travelling to Fukuoka and forming a crystal fortress which drains the city of power, channels it through Fukuoka Tower and transfers it to SpaceGodzilla.

The work consists of a metronome with a photograph of an eye attached to its swinging arm. After the piece was destroyed in 1957, later remakes in multiple copies were renamed Indestructible Object. Considered a \\"readymade\\" piece, in the style established by Marcel Duchamp, it employs an ordinary manufactured object, with little modification, as a work of art. Examples of the work are held in various public collections including Tate Modern London, MOMA New York and Reina Sofía, Madrid. Original and early remakes The metronome, originally manufactured by the Qualite Excelsior company, was a mass-produced product that might be commonly found in many homes. It was probably secondhand when Man Ray reconfigured it as an art object, as it was marred, worn, missing minor parts and stands on mismatched feet, though its mechanism was in fair working order.Dada in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, By Anne Umland, Adrian Sudhalter Its box was made of wood, but its internal elements are metal, its front door removable.Dada in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, By Anne Umland, Adrian Sudhalter The original Object to Be Destroyed was created in 1923. According to Man Ray, the piece was intended as a silent witness in his studio to watch him paint. In 1932, the year Man Ray's lover Lee Miller left him to return to New York, a second version of the piece, called Object of Destruction, was published in the avant-garde journal This Quarter, edited by André Breton. This version featured an ink drawing with the following instructions: > Cut out the eye from a photograph of one who has been loved but is seen no > more. Attach the eye to the pendulum of a metronome and regulate the weight > to suit the tempo desired. Keep going to the limit of endurance. With a > hammer well-aimed, try to destroy the whole at a single blow. To make the connection to Miller more explicit, the object's original eye was replaced with a photo of hers.Eye Of The Beholder, Tate Magazine, Vol 3, 2002 This remade piece was exhibited for the first time at Galerie Pierre Colle in Paris as Eye-Metronome in 1933. The remake was lost in 1940 during the German invasion of Paris. A subsequent replica was exhibited as Lost Object in 1945. Man Ray stated that he had always intended to destroy it one day, but as a public performance. Destruction and multiple editions While on display in the Exhibition Dada in Paris in 1957, a group of protesting students, led by the French poet and calling themselves the 'Jarivistes', took Man Ray at his word and actually destroyed the object. > ...the show was less than a week old when something like the excitement of > the '20s erupted.

Man Ray remade the object yet again in 1958 under the new guise of Indestructible Object. A 1965 collaboration with Swiss artist Daniel Spoerri resulted in an edition of one hundred multiples of Indestructible Object, an allusion to the indestructible nature of the original idea, as well as the difficulty in destroying all one hundred. The work was also exhibited as Last Object in 1966.Between You and Me; Man Ray's Object To Be Destroyed, Mileaf, Art Journal vol 63:1, 2004 Man Ray authorized a further edition of forty sculptures in 1970, where a double-printed image of a blinking eye opens and closes with each swing of the metronome's arm; this late edition was designated Perpetual Motif.

It is believed by Hindus to be the vahana (or vehicle) of Brahma, Gayatri, Saraswati, and Vishvakarma.  Identification  Monier Williams translates the term from Sanskrit as \\"a goose, gander, swan, flamingo (or other aquatic bird, considered as a bird of passage ...).\\"Monier Monier-Williams, Monier Williams Sanskrit Dictionary, हंस, Hamsa, University of Cologne, Germany, , page 1286 The word is also used for a mythical or poetical bird with knowledge. In the Rig Veda, it is the bird which is able to separate Soma from water, when mixed; in later Indian literature, the bird separates milk from water when mixed. In Indian philosophical literature, hamsa represents the individual soul or spirit (typified by the pure sunlight-white like color of a goose or swan), or the \\"Universal Soul or Supreme Spirit\\". The word Hamsa is cognate with Latin \\"(h)anser\\", Greek \\"χήν\\", German \\"Gans\\", English \\"goose\\", Spanish \\"ganso\\" and Russian \\"гусь\\".J. Pokorny, Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch. *ĝhan-s- Jean Vogel, in 1952, questioned the identification of hamsa as swan, because swans were rare, at least in modern India, while the bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) were somewhat common. Some have criticised Vogel's view as being over-reliant on artistic representations from south India and Sri Lanka, where the white swan is rare. According to Vogel, Western and Indian scholars may have preferred translating hamsa in Sanskrit text as swan because the indigenous goose appears plump while the swan (and, Vogel adds, the flamingo) appears more graceful. Vogel also rules out the ruddy shelduck which is unambiguously referred to in Sanskrit as Chakravaka.Jean P Vogel, The Goose in Indian Literature and Art (Arts & Letters, Vol. XXVII, 1952; Reprinted Leiden, 1962), pages 1–2 The Sanskrit and Pali languages, both have alternate words for goose such as Jalapada, Dhamara, Cakragki, Majjugamana, Shvetagaruta and others.Maung Tin, Pali English Dictionary, British Burma Press, Cornell University ArchivesMonier Monier-Williams, Monier Williams Sanskrit Dictionary. See Goose, University of Cologne, Germany, Dave states that the hymns of Rigveda, and verses in Hindu Epics and Puranas mention a variety of birds with the root of hamsa (हंस), such as Maha-hamsa, Raj-hamsa, Kal-hamsa and others, most of which he identifies as swans particularly mute swan, while some refer to geese. Dave's identification is based on the details provided in the Sanskrit texts about the changes in plumage over the bird's life, voice, migratory habits, courtship rituals and flying patterns. Dave cites several Sanskrit works from the Ṛgveda onwards that unambiguously identify the haṃsa as a bird of snowy white plumage. Dave notes that the breeding grounds of various types of swan range from the Caspian to Siberia and Western Turkestan, and that they are seen mainly in Sind, Panjab and sometimes in Nepal and Rajasthan. Some Sanskrit texts, states Dave, distinguish between Hamsa and Kadamb, the former being swan and latter a bar-headed goose. The Indian ornithologist Salim Ali noted that Raghuvira's (with whom Dave worked) identifications of birds in Sanskrit literature were dubious and often far-fetched. Ali considered Raj-hamsa as the bar-headed and Kadamb as the greylag goose. However, the earliest art in India, up until the early colonial period, does not depict swans, but rather birds that resemble the bar-headed goose. Hence, the birds painted at the Ajanta Caves in the depiction of the Hamsa Jataka resemble the bar-headed goose, which are famous for their yearly migration into the Himalayas, while the text of the Jataka itself clearly describes white swans that are like clouds in a blue sky. In Hinduism The hamsa is often identified with the Supreme Spirit, Ultimate Reality or Brahman in Hinduism. The flight of the hamsa symbolizes moksha, the release from the cycle of samsara.John Bowker (1998), Picturing God, Series Editor: Jean Holm, Bloomsbury Academic, , pp 99-101Richard Leviton (2011), Hierophantic Landscapes, , pp 543 The hamsa is also the vahana of Saraswati – the goddess of knowledge and creative arts, and her husband Brahma – the god with powers of creation, in Hindu trinity and his other wife Gayatri - the goddess of vedas(vedmata), one of Adi shakti and her other husband Vishvakarma - the god of Architect. Lake Manasarovar in Hindu mythology, is seen as the summer abode of the hamsa. Poetical images are derived from the flight of the hamsa to that lake in the Himalayas.Kalidasa's maha-kavya Raghuvaṃśa =Yoga= During pranayama, which is a yogic exercise of breath control, hamsa came to epitomize the prana, the breath of life. =Paramahamsa= In view of the association of a hamsa with several attributes as indicated above, Hindu rishis and sadhus have been given the title of paramahamsa, that is, the supreme hamsa. It connotes a particular person who has reached a high level of spirituality. For example, Paramahamsa Upanishad calls that Yogi a Paramahamsa who is neither opinionated nor affected by defamation, nor jealous, not a show off, is humble, and is oblivious to all the human frailties. He is immune to the existence of his body, which he treats as a corpse. He is beyond false pretensions and lives realizing the Brahman. In chapter 3, the Paramahamsa Upanishad states that the one who understands the difference between \\"staff of knowledge\\" and \\"staff of wood\\", is a Paramahamsa. =Mythology= Hamsa, or Hansa, are part of Indian mythology. Arayanna, or heavenly hamsa (swans), are said to live in Manasasaras in the Himalayas. They are mentioned in the Hindu Epic, the Ramayana. Hamsa, the swan, is part of the mythical love story of Nala and Damayanti, where it carries the stories, historical information and messages between the two strangers.George Williams (2001), Handbook of Hindu Mythology, , pages 58-59 In Indian mythology, it is said to eat pearls and separate milk from water from a mixture of both.Helen Myers (1999), Music of Hindu Trinidad: Songs from the India Diaspora, University of Chicago Press, , page 4 Eastern Religious scholar, Alan Watts, stated that the Hindu tradition includes a myth regarding half a Hamsa's eggshell becoming the sky and the other half becoming the earth. A similar egg-sky-earth cosmological story can be found in the Finlandic myths recorded in the Kalevala, where the eggshell of a duck forms the sky and earth. Buddhism A bird probably a goose reliquary, found in Taxila, Gandhara (1st century CE). This was found inside a granite bowl, with a gold sheet inscription (now lost). Scholars state the lost inscription read \\"a relic of the Buddha was placed in the goose reliquary for the benefit of Sira's parents in a future existence\\". Now at the British Museum.British Museum Collection Bird, probably a goose, carved in rock crystal. The hamsa was also used extensively in the art of Gandhara, in conjunction with images of the Shakyamuni Buddha. It is also deemed sacred in the Buddhadharma.  Contemporary usage  The name in other languages in which it is culturally important are Hindi: hans, Telugu: హంస, hamsa Tamil: அன்னப்பறவை; , hong; , , and commonly spelt hintha or hinthar; , or hongsa; Shan: , or hangsa; Thai: hong (หงส์), ; Malay: angsa (اڠسا‎).

Now completed and utilized by the Narita Sky Access Line. The was a planned high- speed Shinkansen (\\"bullet train\\") line proposed to connect Narita International Airport with Tokyo Station. The project was abandoned, although parts of the planned route are used by the Keisei Narita Airport Line (Narita Sky Access). History Planning of the Narita Shinkansen started in 1966 and permission to build was granted in 1972, with completion initially scheduled for 1976, in time for the airport's opening. Construction started 1974, but was significantly hampered due to resistance from local residents protesting against the expropriation of their land for a project that would bring no benefit to them. (Similar issues have afflicted Narita Airport itself.) Construction was frozen in 1983, and the Basic Plan granting construction rights was cancelled by a special law in 1987 -- the only Shinkansen line ever to meet this fate. Due to the opposition, only a 9 km stretch of trackbed and the airport station shell had been constructed before the project was halted. While the Shinkansen link was stalled, the private Keisei Electric Railway had constructed an ordinary rail link to the airport. However, Keisei services had to terminate outside airport grounds and transfer passengers by bus, as the station inside the airport and the track connecting to it was owned by then state operator Japanese National Railways. After the passage of the groundbreaking Railway Business Act in 1986, Keisei acquired the rights to operate as a \\"third type\\" (第3種) railway company that leases tracks from JR, and starting in 1991 both Keisei and JR have operated direct airport services to the terminal built for the Shinkansen. The culvert connecting to the airport station was also designed for Shinkansen use. Route Map of planned route The line was to originate at underground platforms located roughly equidistant from Tokyo Station and Yūrakuchō Station in central Tokyo. From there, it was to run underground to Etchūjima in Kōtō Ward, then above ground, following the Tōzai Line route across the Ara River to Funabashi. In Funabashi, the line was to again run underground, emerging in Shiroi, then following a smooth curve through Chiba New Town and central Narita, and finally running underground again to terminate beneath the passenger terminal at Narita Airport. Originally, the Tokyo-Narita trains were to make no station stops: JNR later added one additional station to the planned line to serve Chiba New Town. A depot for trains operating on the line was planned at a location approximately 51 km from Tokyo, including a single-track connecting link to the JR Narita Line at Shimōsa-Manzaki Station. Much of this right of way is used by commuter lines. The area of Tokyo Station earmarked for the Shinkansen platforms and the tunnel to Etchujima are now used by the JR Keiyō Line. Much of the above-ground right of way had already been earmarked by the Chiba Prefecture for railway use. The Hokusō Railway uses one segment of this right of way between Komuro and Chiba New Town, and another section between Chiba New Town and the airport is used as part of the Keisei Narita Airport Line. Future While revivals of the Narita Shinkansen have been proposed periodically, the cancellation of the basic plan, lack of political will and the construction of the Keisei Narita Airport Line as a replacement all combine to make this unlikely. The Keisei Narita Airport Line was built as standard gauge (like the Shinkansen), theoretically leaving a door open for eventual conversion. However, the Rapid Railway's design speed is only 160 km/h and it will -- at least initially -- terminate at Keisei Ueno Station, not the more central Shinkansen hub of Tokyo Station. Also, the Sky Access is electrified at 1500 V DC, whereas the Shinkansen standard is 25 kV AC. Technical details With a design speed of at least 200 km/h, the Narita Shinkansen was designed to cover the 65-kilometer distance in 35 minutes, including a stop at Chiba New Town. The Narita Express takes 53 minutes for the same trip (non-stop but along different tracks, making a detour via Chiba), while the more direct Keisei Narita Airport Line connects Narita to Nippori in 36 minutes.

Eucharius was sent to Gaul by Saint Peter as bishop, together with the deacon Valerius and the subdeacon Maternus, to preach the Gospel. They came to the Rhine and to Ellelum in Alsace, where Maternus died. His two companions hastened back to St. Peter and begged him to restore the dead man to life. St. Peter gave his pastoral staff to Eucharius, and, upon being touched with it, Maternus, who had been in his grave for forty days, returned to life. The Gentiles were then converted in large numbers. After founding many churches the three companions went to Trier where the work of evangelization progressed so rapidly that Eucharius chose that city for his episcopal residence.

The staff of Saint Peter, with which he had been raised to life, was preserved in Cologne till the end of the tenth century when the upper half was presented to Trier, and was afterwards taken to Prague by Emperor Charles IV.

UIMS are designed to support N-tier architectures by strictly defining and enforcing the boundary between the business logic and the GUI. A fairly rigid Software architecture is nearly always implied by the UIMS, and most often only one paradigm of separation is supported in a single UIMS. A UIMS may also have libraries and systems such as graphical tools for the creation of user interface resources or data stores. Generally, you cannot easily use multiple UIMS systems at the same time, so choosing the correct model for your UIMS is a critical design decision in any project. The choice of system is dependent upon the system(s) you wish to create user interfaces for, and the general style of your application. For example, if you want to create a web based front end, or just a standalone application or both that would be an important factor in choosing. If you want to deploy to the Macintosh, Windows and Linux, that would further influence your choice of a UIMS system. There are many UIMS approaches described in research papers. However, there are not very many systems available commercially or through open source. Models In a frequently cited body of work, Foley and Wallace describe a \\"linguistic model\\" for user interface management consisting of a Presentation Layer, a Dialog Control layer and an Application layer. These layers correspond to the lexical, syntactic and semantic layers from formal language theory. While Foley's model is theoretically enlightening, it does not propose a specific practical system for separating code. There are also many interesting border cases that don't fall cleanly into one of these layers. A more directly applicable theory of user interface management is the Model-view-controller design pattern, which is described in detail in its own article. A recent variant of MVC is the Model-view-presenter model which is similar to MVC, but has some interesting insights into the problem. Implementations A functional based system approaches all user interface actions as interfaces for functions. Dialogs exist solely to collect parameters for functions that are called when the dialog is closing. Menu Trees are one family of model implementations that follow this pattern. Grammar based UIMS provide a specialized language for describing the user interface. Usually, this is a special language designed specifically for the presentation of user interface elements. The Editing Model is a specialization of grammar based UIMS. They present all interaction as direct presentations of underlying presentation objects. Essentially, using the grammar of the programming language as the grammar for the GUI. A scroll bar may present an integer, a check box may present a boolean, a function is presented as a button or menu item. A dialog box or a menu is a presentation of a complex object containing properties and functions. A controller layer automatically synchronizes the object with the presentation and vice versa through a two way connection provided by an Observer pattern. Enable/disable and validation present special challenges under the editing model, but they can be dealt with. A commercial program, ViewSoft Internet, was briefly available in the 1990s that implemented a general purpose GUI builder based upon the Editing Model. Transition Networks present the user interface logic as a kind of intelligent flowchart. In an Event Language model, the computer language is designed around the handling of events. This is essentially the approach taken in Microsoft's .Net languages C# and Visual Basic.Net with their delegate and event language structures. Other models include Hypertalk, Production Systems and Declarative Languages.

She was a daughter of Philip III of France and Maria of Brabant. Life Her father died when she was six years old and she grew up under guidance of her mother and Joan I of Navarre, her half-brother King Philip IV's wife. =Queen= The death of Edward's beloved first wife, Eleanor of Castile, at the age of 49 in 1290, left him reeling in grief. However, it was much to Edward's benefit to make peace with France to free him to pursue his wars in Scotland. Additionally, with only one surviving son, Edward was anxious to protect the English throne with additional heirs. In summer of 1291, the English king had betrothed his son and heir, the future Edward II, to Blanche, half-sister to the French King Philip IV, in order to achieve peace with France. However, hearing of her renowned beauty, Edward decided to have his son's bride for his own and sent emissaries to France. Philip agreed to give Blanche to Edward on the conditions that a truce would be concluded between the two countries, and that Edward would give up the province of Gascony. Edward agreed, and sent his brother Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster, to fetch the new bride. Edward had been deceived, for Blanche was to be married to Rudolph, the eldest son of King Albert I of Germany. Instead, Philip offered her younger sister Margaret to marry Edward (then 55). Upon hearing this, Edward declared war on France, refusing to marry Margaret. After five years, a truce was agreed upon under the influence of Pope Boniface VIII. A series of treaties in the first half of 1299 provided terms for a double marriage: Edward I would marry Margaret and his son would marry Isabella, Philip's only surviving daughter. Additionally, the English monarchy would regain the key territory of Guyenne and receive £15,000 owed to Margaret as well as the return of Eleanor of Castile's lands in Ponthieu and Montreuil as a dower first for Margaret, and then Isabella. Margaret's seal as queen Edward was then 60 years old, at least 40 years older than his bride. The wedding took place at Canterbury on 10 September 1299. Margaret was never crowned due to financial constraints, being the first uncrowned queen since the Conquest. This in no way lessened her dignity as the king's wife, however, for she used the royal title in her letters and documents, and appeared publicly wearing a crown even though she had not received one during a formal rite of investiture. Edward soon returned to the Scottish border to continue his campaigns and left Margaret in London, but she had become pregnant quickly after the wedding. After several months, bored and lonely, the young queen decided to join her husband. Nothing could have pleased the king more, for Margaret's actions reminded him of his first wife Eleanor, who had had two of her sixteen children abroad. In less than a year Margaret gave birth to a son, Thomas of Brotherton who was named after Thomas Becket, since she had prayed to him during her pregnancy. The next year she gave birth to another son, Edmund. Many who fell under the king's wrath were saved from too stern a punishment by the queen's influence over her husband, and the statement, Pardoned solely on the intercession of our dearest consort, queen Margaret of England, appears. In 1305, the young queen acted as a mediator between her step-son and husband, reconciling the heir to his aging father, and calming her husband's wrath. She favored the Franciscan order and was a benefactress of a new foundation at Newgate. Margaret employed the minstrel Guy de Psaltery and both she and her husband liked to play chess. She and her stepson, the future king Edward II (who was only two years younger than she), also became fond of each other: he once made her a gift of an expensive ruby and gold ring, and she on one occasion rescued many of the prince's friends from the wrath of the King. The mismatched couple were blissfully happy. When Blanche died in 1305 (her husband never became emperor), Edward ordered all the court to go into mourning to please his queen. He had realised the wife he had gained was \\"a pearl of great price\\" as Margaret was respected for her beauty, virtue, and piety. The same year Margaret gave birth to a girl, Eleanor, named in honour of Edward's first wife, a choice which surprised many, and showed Margaret's unjealous nature. In 1307, Edward went on summer campaign to Scotland. Margaret accompanied him. Edward died in Burgh by Sands. =Queen dowager= Arms of Margaret of France as Queen of England. Margaret never remarried after Edward's death in 1307, despite being only 26 when widowed. She was alleged to have stated that \\"when Edward died, all men died for me\\". Margaret was not pleased when Edward II elevated Piers Gaveston to become Earl of Cornwall upon his father's death, since the title had been meant for one of her own sons. She attended the new king's wedding to her half-niece, Isabella of France, and a silver casket was made with both their arms. After Isabella's coronation, Margaret retired to Marlborough Castle (which was by this time a dower house), but she stayed in touch with the new queen and with her half- brother Philip IV by letter during the confusing times leading up to Gaveston's death in 1312. Margaret, too, was a victim of Gaveston's influence over her step-son. Edward II gave several of her dower lands to the favourite, including Berkhamsted Castle. In May 1308, an anonymous informer reported that Margaret had provided £40,000 along with Philip IV to support the English barons against Gaveston. Due to this action, Gaveston was briefly exiled and Margaret remained fairly unmolested by the upstart until his death in June 1312. She was present at the birth of the future Edward III in November 1312. On 14 February 1318 she died in her castle at Marlborough. Dressed in a Franciscan habit, she was buried at Christ Church Greyfriars in London, a church she had generously endowed. Her tomb, beautifully carved, was destroyed during the Reformation. Issue In all, Margaret gave birth to three children: * Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk (1 June 1300 – 4 August 1338) * Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent (5 August 1301 – 19 March 1330) * Eleanor of England (4 May 1306 – 1311) Died at Amesbury Abbey, buried at Beaulieu Abbey.

In the 1980s it was taken over by a company associated with Michael Ashcroft then some years later sold to Yorkshire bus manufacturer Plaxton. Long-established Plaxton took the Henlys name in March 1992, sold the motor business in 1997 and with the freed capital became a major player in the bus and coach business in North America. Henlys Group, previously known as Plaxton, found it was unable to service the debt taken on for its North American expansion, liquidated what it could and closed its business in 2004. HistoryHenlys Limited Frank Hough (1888-1935) —who also had his own motor business in Walsall which he'd started in 1909— and Herbert Gerald Henly (1891-1973) began business in 1917 as car dealers at 89 Great Portland Street, London. When their private company was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1928 they claimed to have one of the largest retail motor organisations in the country. It carried on business in London and Manchester dealing in \\"new and second hand cars of all descriptions\\".Pending Motor-car Issue.

In addition providing nearly 250,000 tank and aircraft assemblies and parts, repair or dismantling of 1,000 aircraft, handling over 80,000 tanks and packing more than a million spare parts.

The Times, Tuesday, Aug 07, 1984; pg. 13; Issue 61903 Plaxton Group Henlys was bought by the Lord Ashcroft backed Hawley Goodall, owners of Coleman Milne, the makers of funeral hearses. The bid was made via a Canadian-based company part-owned by David Wickins of British Car Auctions. On completion of the takeover, Hawley Goodall formed a Motoring Division comprising Henlys and Coleman Milne. In 1989, Hawley Goodall sold its Motoring Division consisting of Henlys and Coleman Milne to the Plaxton Group, the bus and coach manufacturer based in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. In May 1992, the Plaxton Group PLC was renamed Henlys Group PLC. Coleman Milne was sold to a management buy-out in late 1992. Henlys Group plc Henlys pursued a strategy of diversification and expansion through the 1990s. The established Wigan bus bodybuilder Northern Counties was bought in 1995 for £10 million. The UK bus and coach manufacturing business, trading under the Plaxton brand, continued to produce a range of bus and coach bodywork. It also owned one of the largest UK coach dealers, Kirkby, and provided after-sales services to coach and bus operators. =North America= Henlys acquired a 49 per cent. share in Prévost, a leading North American manufacturer of coaches and bus shells in 1995. The other 51 per cent of Prévost was owned by Volvo. Car dealerships produced less than one fifth of Henlys' 1996 profits.

The Times, Wednesday, December 24, 1997; pg. 21; Issue 66081 In February 1998, Prévost acquired Nova Bus, a city bus manufacturer for the Canadian and US market. =Dennis= In July 1998 Henlys made an agreed (with Dennis) bid of £190 million for bus and utility vehicle maker Dennis. A hostile bidding war ensued with engineering group Mayflower, owners of Scottish bus builder Walter Alexander. Volvo lent its support to the Henlys bid, which was raised to £247 million, but the Dennis board ultimately accepted Mayflower's £268.9 million offer. The next year Henlys announced they were planning to spend up to £100 million on acquisitions, the money intended to be spent on the acquisition of Dennis, in order to expand its bus building activities in the US. After discussions with several companies, Henlys purchased Blue Bird, the US school bus manufacturer, for £267 million. This prompted speculation that Volvo might bid for Henlys. Henlys raised £111 million in a rights issue in order to fund the acquisition. =TransBus International= In August 2000, with continuing domestic sales difficulties, a joint venture was formed with Mayflower, now owners of the Dennis and Alexander brands. The joint venture, known as TransBus International, included only the United Kingdom bus manufacturing operations, including Plaxton and Northern Counties. Henlys held a 30 per cent stake in the joint venture, which employed 3,300 employees at seven locations. The traditional brands of Alexander, Dennis and Plaxton were replaced by TransBus International. TransBus International went into administration on 31 March 2004.Legal Notices—TRANSBUS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED.

Henlys hoped to preserve their North American operations which had strong order books. However, servicing debt had placed too heavy a burden on those businesses. The North American operations were restructured, including closure of the Nova Bus factory in Roswell, New Mexico. Liquidation In May 2004 a new chairman, David James, was appointed to help rescue Henlys. In June 2004 it was announced that a restructuring of Henlys would leave the shares with little or no value, and that Henlys' problems were caused by paying too high a price for the Blue Bird business in 1999. Henlys' shares were delisted from the Stock Exchange.\\"Parent of Bus-Maker Blue Bird Pulls Stock from London Exchange\\", Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News, 17 June 2004 . In October 2004 the Blue Bird operations were restructured with Volvo and creditor banks taking over the Henlys share. Volvo also took over the Prevost and Nova Bus operations.

He is often categorized with the writers of the Beat Generation. He wrote for the Village Voice, Playboy, New York Element and International Times, among many other publications. He worked for a time at The New Yorker, where Brendan Gill recalled he was often \\"stripped to the waist.\\" Career Krim was born in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan and spent much of his time in New York City. He was widely regarded as part of the New Journalism movement of the 1960s; in 1965 he joined the New York Herald Tribune′s staff, which included Jimmy Breslin, Tom Wolfe and Dick Schaap. His robust prose was often laced with a startling, often funny, candor. In his introduction to Jack Kerouac's novel Desolation Angels, published in 1965, Krim argued for Kerouac's place in the annals of American literature. He taught writing seminars at a number of universities in the United States and abroad, including Mexico and Israel. For several years during the early 1980s he served as head of The Writers Workshop in Iowa City. His honors included the Longview Award for Literature (1960), a Guggenheim Fellowship (1976) and a Fulbright grant (1985). After suffering from a number of physical setbacks, including a debilitating heart attack, Krim committed suicide in his one-room apartment on East 10th Street by an overdose of barbiturates on August 30, 1989. Posthumous Phillip Lopate published Krim's \\"For My Brothers and Sisters in the Failure Business\\" in his 1997 anthology The Art of the Personal Essay. In 2001, Saul Bellow included \\"What's This Cat's Story?\\" in Editors: The Best from Five Decades. Also in 2001, critic Vivian Gornick praised Krim as \\"a Jewish Joan Didion\\" in her book The Situation and the Story.

For example, in linear algebra if the number of constraints (independent equations) in a system of linear equations equals the number of unknowns then precisely one solution exists; if there are fewer independent equations than unknowns, an infinite number of solutions exist; and if the number of independent equations exceeds the number of unknowns, then no solutions exist. In the context of partial differential equations, constraint counting is a crude but often useful way of counting the number of free functions needed to specify a solution to a partial differential equation. Partial differential equations Consider a second order partial differential equation in three variables, such as the two-dimensional wave equation : u_{tt} = u_{xx} + u_{yy}. It is often profitable to think of such an equation as a rewrite rule allowing us to rewrite arbitrary partial derivatives of the function u(t,x,y) using fewer partials than would be needed for an arbitrary function. For example, if u satisfies the wave equation, we can rewrite : u_{tyt} = u_{tty} = u_{xxy} + u_{yyy} where in the first equality, we appealed to the fact that partial derivatives commute. =Linear equations= To answer this in the important special case of a linear partial differential equation, Einstein asked: how many of the partial derivatives of a solution can be linearly independent? It is convenient to record his answer using an ordinary generating function :s(\\\\xi) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty s_k \\\\xi^k where s_k is a natural number counting the number of linearly independent partial derivatives (of order k) of an arbitrary function in the solution space of the equation in question. Whenever a function satisfies some partial differential equation, we can use the corresponding rewrite rule to eliminate some of them, because further mixed partials have necessarily become linearly dependent. Specifically, the power series counting the variety of arbitrary functions of three variables (no constraints) is :f(\\\\xi) = \\\\frac{1}{(1-\\\\xi)^3} = 1 + 3 \\\\xi + 6 \\\\xi^2 + 10 \\\\xi^3 + \\\\dots but the power series counting those in the solution space of some second order p.d.e. is :g(\\\\xi) = \\\\frac{1-\\\\xi^2}{(1-\\\\xi)^3} = 1 + 2 \\\\xi + 5 \\\\xi^2 + 7 \\\\xi^3 + \\\\dots which records that we can eliminate one second order partial u_{tt}, three third order partials u_{ttt}, \\\\, u_{ttx}, \\\\, u_{tty} , and so forth. More generally, the o.g.f. for an arbitrary function of n variables is :s[n](\\\\xi) = 1/(1-\\\\xi)^n = 1 + n \\\\, \\\\xi + \\\\left( \\\\begin{matrix} n  2 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right) \\\\, \\\\xi^2 + \\\\left( \\\\begin{matrix} n+1  3 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right) \\\\, \\\\xi^3 + \\\\dots where the coefficients of the infinite power series of the generating function are constructed using an appropriate infinite sequence of binomial coefficients, and the power series for a function required to satisfy a linear m-th order equation is :g(\\\\xi) = \\\\frac{1-\\\\xi^m}{(1-\\\\xi)^n} Next, : \\\\frac{1-\\\\xi^2}{(1-\\\\xi)^3} = \\\\frac{1 + \\\\xi}{(1-\\\\xi)^2} which can be interpreted to predict that a solution to a second order linear p.d.e. in three variables is expressible by two freely chosen functions of two variables, one of which is used immediately, and the second, only after taking a first derivative, in order to express the solution. =General solution of initial value problem= To verify this prediction, recall the solution of the initial value problem :u_{tt} = u_{xx} + u_{yy}, \\\\; u(0,x,y) = p(x,y), \\\\; u_t(0,x,y) = q(x,y) Applying the Laplace transform u(t,x,y) \\\\mapsto [Lu](\\\\omega,x,y) gives : -\\\\omega^2 \\\\, [Lu] + \\\\omega \\\\, p(x,y) + q(x,y) + [Lu]_x + [Lu]_y Applying the Fourier transform [Lu](\\\\omega,x,y) \\\\mapsto [FLU](\\\\omega,m,n) to the two spatial variables gives : -\\\\omega^2 \\\\, [FLu] + \\\\omega \\\\, [Fp] + [Fq] - (m^2+n^2) \\\\, [FLu] or :[FLu](\\\\omega,m,n) = \\\\frac{ \\\\omega \\\\, [Fp](m,n) + [Fq](m,n)}{\\\\omega^2 + m^2 + n^2} Applying the inverse Laplace transform gives : [Fu](t,m,n) = [Fp](m,n) \\\\, \\\\cos( \\\\sqrt{m^2+n^2} \\\\, t ) + \\\\frac{ [Fq](m,n) \\\\, \\\\sin (\\\\sqrt{m^2+n^2} \\\\, t) }{\\\\sqrt{m^2+n^2}} Applying the inverse Fourier transform gives :u(t,x,y) = Q(t,x,y) + P_t(t,x,y) where :P(t,x,y) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi} \\\\, \\\\int_{(x-x')^2 + (y-y')^2 < t^2} \\\\frac{p(x',y') \\\\, dx' dy'}{ \\\\left[ t^2-(x-x')^2-(y-y')^2 \\\\right]^{1/2}} :Q(t,x,y) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi} \\\\, \\\\int_{(x-x')^2 + (y-y')^2 < t^2} \\\\frac{q(x',y') \\\\, dx' dy'}{ \\\\left[ t^2-(x-x')^2-(y-y')^2 \\\\right]^{1/2}} Here, p,q are arbitrary (sufficiently smooth) functions of two variables, so (due their modest time dependence) the integrals P,Q also count as \\"freely chosen\\" functions of two variables; as promised, one of them is differentiated once before adding to the other to express the general solution of the initial value problem for the two dimensional wave equation. =Quasilinear equations= In the case of a nonlinear equation, it will only rarely be possible to obtain the general solution in closed form. However, if the equation is quasilinear (linear in the highest order derivatives), then we can still obtain approximate information similar to the above: specifying a member of the solution space will be \\"modulo nonlinear quibbles\\" equivalent to specifying a certain number of functions in a smaller number of variables. The number of these functions is the Einstein strength of the p.d.e. In the simple example above, the strength is two, although in this case we were able to obtain more precise information.

The main alias used by Mitinen in the US was Edna Margaret Patterson. Her codenames, in Soviet intelligence circles included \\"Салли\\" \\"Sally\\", and \\"Австралийка\\" \\"Avstraliyka\\", which (literally translated) is the feminine form of \\"(The) Australian\\". However, US counterintelligence services usually translated the latter name as \\"The Australian Woman\\". Mitinen was born at 85½ Morehead Street, Redfern, an inner suburb of Sydney, on 31 January 1914, according to a 2017 article by Australian historian and journalist Michael Connor. Her full name when her birth was registered was Frances Metianen, and her émigré Russian parents' names also appear in Australian records in the anglicised forms of James and Julie Metianen. Their older children, both of whom had been born before or shortly after the family arrived in Sydney, were known in Australia as Victor and Leonore (or Lena). James Metianen reportedly worked as a fitter at the Eveleigh Railway Workshops. During the 1920s,the family apparently lived in the Parramatta area, where Frances attended Parramatta High School and the Metianen children took part in local sports teams, including Frances' brother Victor, who was frequently mentioned in newspaper reports regarding amateur cricket matches. James Metianen was involved in pro- Soviet and communist political activities, as were Victor Metianen and his English-born wife Coral (née Sutcliffe). The entire family apparently moved to the Soviet Union during the 1930s. However, some members of the Mitinen family were imprisoned on political grounds, such as Victor and Coral Mitinen. (According to Connor, Victor Mitinen died in a Gulag during the early 1940s, while Coral Mitinen was released, later visited relatives in England and died at Odessa in 1966.) Before or during World War II, Francia Mitinen was recruited by the naval branch of the GRU. She entered the United States at San Francisco in August 1943,John Earl Haynes & Harvey Klehr, Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America, (1999).

The film was produced by longtime Alfred Hitchcock associate Joan Harrison, scripted by Jonathan Latimer, and directed by Edwin L. Marin.. It was one of several medium budget thrillers Raft made in the late 1940s. Plot The film opens on Keith Vincent, a Hollywood composer, as he creates a new song called \\"Nocturne\\". As he plays his piano, a woman sits silently in the shadows and listens to the composer speak as he plays. But the mood changes a little and he says \\"you're no longer the one\\" and encourages her to go away for a while. Moments later, as he alters the score with a pen, the composer is shot and killed. The police think it is suicide, but detective Joe Warne suspects murder. Susan Flanders is sleeping in the house but had ear-plugs in because \\"she didn't like the music\\". They take her in for questioning. Warne begins looking for \\"Dolores\\", because he sees that the score for \\"Nocturne\\" still on the piano has a hand-written dedication to this name. The Philipino houseboy, Eujemio, arrives after a day off - he knows his employer was planning to meet a woman but he does not know who. He tells Warne that the composer was a womanizer who called all of his girlfriends Dolores. There is a line of female photos on the wall... one is missing. The coroner returns a verdict of suicide but Warne continues to invrestigate despite being warned to stop by his boss. Warne follows a series of clues around Los Angeles. He spots he is being followed by a large man and challenges him outside the Brown Derby. Warne's ruthless questioning tactics lead several suspects to report him for abuse. Pursuing the case with dogged determination, the obsessed Warne is suspended from the police force. As he digs deeper into the murder, the clues draw him closer to Frances Ransom, but he deduces that she was framed by Ned Ford. Ford was enraged that his wife Carol had merely been the composer's latest conquest. When he found out that the composer had no intention of marrying Carol, Ford decided to kill him. Warne turns Ford over to the police, and reveals to Frances that he knew almost from the beginning that she was not the murderer.

Politician In the field of business, entrepreneurship involves people taking a risk in order to create new business ventures, to gain advantage over a competitor, and to maximize profits. Traditionally entrepreneurs have been associated with the world of business, however the term is used in the political arena also. For example, Choi Taewook in 2004 wrote: > A political entrepreneur refers to a political player who seeks to gain > certain political and social benefits in return for providing the common > goods that can be shared by an unorganized general public. These common > goods that political entrepreneurs attempt to provide to the populace > generally include foreign- and domestic-related public policy, while the > benefits they hope to gain involve voter support, public recognition, and > personal popularity. =History and cultural context= The political activism of American business as a class has surged and ebbed at various historical moments. Variations in both business and countervailing political mobilization should be approached as problems of collective interpretation and action. To explain the historical patterns of class-wide business activism, we need to look at the dynamics of partisan regimes in American politics. Partisan leaders, not businesses or other policy-seekers themselves, have the strongest incentives to absorb the transaction costs associated with either broad-scale business or countervailing collective action. When partisan entrepreneurs see an opportunity to alter the distribution of power at the national level, they engage in a discursive exercise to remold business or oppositional interests and undertake the mobilization of these interests. An analytical framework for dealing with political entrepreneurship and reform is proposed which is based on some new combinations of Schumpeterian political economy, an extended version of Tullock's model of democracy as franchise-bidding for natural monopoly and some basic elements of New Institutional Economics. It is shown that problems of insufficient award criteria and incomplete contracts which may arise in economic bidding schemes, also – and even more so – characterise political competition. At the same time, these conditions create leeway for Schumpeterian political entrepreneurship. The same is true for various barriers to entry in politics. These barriers affect a trade-off between political stability and political contestability which will be discussed with special emphasis on incentives and opportunities for political entrepreneurship in the sense of risking long-term investments in basic political reforms. Businessperson However the term is also used in a very different way by those that wish to contrast what they see as a pure \\"market entrepreneur\\" with someone that uses the political system to further a commercial venture or their own career. On this definition a political entrepreneur is a business entrepreneur who seeks to gain profit through subsidies, protectionism, government contracts, or other such favorable arrangements with government(s) through political influence (also known as corporate welfare). Ed Younkins (in 2000) wrote: \\"Political entrepreneurs seek and receive help from the state and, therefore, are not true entrepreneurs.\\" Similarly, Thomas DiLorenzo says, \\"a political entrepreneur succeeds primarily by influencing government to subsidize his business or industry, or to enact legislation or regulation that harms his competitors.\\" He says, in contrast, the \\"market entrepreneur succeeds financially by selling a newer, better, or less expensive product on the free market without any government subsidies, direct or indirect.\\" He gives the example of a mousetrap manufacturer who seeks to gain market share by making a better mousetrap as being a market entrepreneur, and a manufacturer who lobbies Congress to ban the importation of foreign-made mousetraps as a political entrepreneur. (DiLorenzo, Thomas, Chapter 7 of How Capitalism Saved America) In practice, the division between the market entrepreneur and the political entrepreneur can be hazy. Many business entrepreneurs share both characteristics in varying degrees. The term appears to have been coined by Burton W. Folsom Jr. in his book, The Myth of the Robber Barons.

Its milk business is operated by RFM Corporation, while its ice cream business is operated under a joint-venture with Unilever Philippines, Inc. (known as Unilever RFM Ice Cream, Inc.). History The brand's beginnings can be traced back to 1933 when Ramón Arce started pasteurizing carabao milk near his home in Novaliches (then a part of Caloocan City), where carabaos were in abundance. Unilever RFM Ice Cream, Inc. would cite the brand's foundation year as 1948. Arce began selling and distributing fresh milk in bottles using the Selecta brand name to residences, restaurants and offices. Soon after, Arce and his wife, Carmen, would come up with their own ice cream recipe made from carabao milk. These products became the foundation of the family's Selecta business, which later included the Selecta restaurants and bakery. The Selecta business was continued by Arce's children after his retirement in 1950. By the 1970s, Selecta's carabao milk based ice cream and fresh milk became available in supermarkets. Its milk was packaged in glass bottles while its ice cream was packaged in gold colored tin containers. In January 1990, RFM Corporation acquired the Selecta trademark from Arcecon Dairy Products, Inc. (successor- in-interest to the Selecta business) and established Selecta Dairy Products, Inc. to take over the production of Selecta ice cream. Under RFM ownership, the recipe of Selecta ice cream was improved and aggressively marketed, posing a serious challenge to then market leader, Magnolia. With its success, its ice cream recipe would eventually shift to cow's milk. Much later, the gold colored tin containers would be changed to gold colored plastic tubs. RFM also introduced its own Selecta milk products which were made from cow's milk. In January 1995, the family of Mauro Arce, the youngest son of Ramón and Carmen Arce, revived the Arce family's ice cream business under a new name, Arce Dairy. Its ice cream would continue to be made from carabao milk and packaged in gold colored tin containers, reminiscent of the original Arce-era Selecta ice cream. In February 1999, RFM entered into a joint-venture with Unilever Philippines, Inc. to take over the production and marketing of the Selecta ice cream business. For this purpose, Selecta Walls, Inc. was established (now known as Unilever RFM Ice Cream, Inc.). The Selecta milk business continues to be operated directly by RFM Corporation.

Although the Indian defences were championed in the 1920s by players in the hypermodern school, they were not fully accepted until Russian players showed in the late 1940s that these systems are sound for Black. Since then, the Indian defences have become a popular way for Black to respond to 1.d4 because they often offer an unbalanced game with winning chances for both sides. Transpositions are important and many variations can be reached by several move orders. It is also possible to transpose into classical openings such as the Queen's Gambit and the Slav Defence; these are not considered \\"Indian\\" openings. The usual White second move is 2.c4, grabbing a larger share of the centre and allowing the move Nc3, to prepare for moving the e-pawn to e4 without blocking the c-pawn with the knight. Black's most popular replies are *2...e6, freeing the king's bishop and leading into the Nimzo-Indian Defence, Queen's Indian Defence, Bogo-Indian Defence, Modern Benoni, Catalan Opening, or regular lines of the Queen's Gambit Declined, *2...g6, preparing a fianchetto of the king's bishop and entering the King's Indian Defence or Grünfeld Defence, and *2...c5, the Benoni Defense, with an immediate counter-punch in the centre, but other moves are played as detailed below. Instead of 2.c4, White often plays 2.Nf3. Then Black may play 2...d5 which may transpose to a Queen's Gambit after 3.c4. Or Black may play 2...e6 which retains possibilities of transposing to a Queen's Gambit or Queen's Indian Defence. Alternatively 2...g6 may transpose to a King's Indian Defence or Grünfeld Defence, while 2...c5 invites transposition to a Benoni. White can deny Black any of these transpositions by refraining from c2–c4 over the next several moves. On the second move, White can also play 2.Bg5, the Trompowsky Attack. Black can respond 2...Ne4 (see 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 Ne4), or 2...e6 (see 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 e6), among other moves. A third alternative for White is the rarer 2.Nc3. Then Black may play 2...d5, after which 3.Bg5 is the Richter-Veresov Attack (D01, see 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nc3 d5). Black may also play 2...g6 (see 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nc3 g6). History The earliest known use of the term \\"Indian Defence\\" was in 1884, and the name was attributed to the openings used by the Indian player Moheschunder Bannerjee against John Cochrane. In this case the opening moves were 1.e4 d6 2.d4 g6. Philip W.

He also proposes the names \\"Proto-Indian\\" for 1.d4 d6, \\"Pseudo-Indian\\" for 1.d4 c5, \\"Semi-Indian\\" for 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nc3 and \\"Three Quarter Indian\\" for 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nd2, none of which came into wider use.Savielly Tartakower, Die hypermoderne Schachpartie, Verlag der Wiener Schachzeitung, Vienna, 1924, pp411-425. The modern names \\"King's Indian Defence\\", \\"Queen's Indian Defence\\", \\"Old Indian Defence\\" and \\"King's Indian Attack\\" were attributed by Richard Reti to Hans Kmoch, though Reti himself did not approve of these terms. Reti also attributed to Kmoch the terms \\"All Indian Defence\\" (where Black fianchettoes both bishops after 1.d4 Nf6) and \\"Queen's Indian Attack\\" (where White opens 1.Nf3 and 2.b3) but these did not come into general use.Richard Reti, Die Meister des Schachbretts (Masters of the Chessboard), p121, p160 (1930) Main lines beginning 2.c42...e6=Nimzo-Indian Defence: 3.Nc3 Bb4  Advocated by Nimzowitsch as early as 1913, the Nimzo- Indian Defence was the first of the Indian systems to gain full acceptance. It remains one of the most popular and well-respected defences to 1.d4, and White often chooses move orders designed to avoid it. Black attacks the centre with pieces and is prepared to trade a bishop for a knight to weaken White's queenside with doubled pawns. Queen's Indian Defence: 3.Nf3 b6  The Queen's Indian Defence is considered solid, safe, and perhaps somewhat drawish. Black often chooses the Queen's Indian when White avoids the Nimzo- Indian by playing 3.Nf3 instead of 3.Nc3. Black constructs a sound position that makes no positional concessions, although sometimes it is difficult for Black to obtain good winning chances. Karpov is a leading expert in this opening. Many Queen's Indian Defence players also play the Nimzo-Indian Defence, and in fact the line 3.Nf3 b6 4.Nc3 Bb4 is sometimes called the \\"Nimzo/Queen's Indian Hybrid\\" or similar, and could be classified under either opening. Bogo-Indian Defence: 3.Nf3 Bb4+  The Bogo-Indian Defence is a solid alternative to the Queen's Indian, into which it sometimes transposes. It is less popular than that opening, however, perhaps because many players are loath to surrender the (particularly without doubling White's pawns), as Black often ends up doing after 4.Nbd2. The classical 4.Bd2 Qe7 is also often seen, although more recently 4...a5!? and even 4...c5!? have emerged as alternatives. Transposition to the Nimzo-Indian with 4.Nc3 is perfectly playable but rarely seen, since most players who play 3.Nf3 do so in order to avoid that opening. Blumenfeld Countergambit: 3.Nf3 c5 4.d5 b5  The Blumenfeld Countergambit bears a superficial but misleading resemblance to the Benko Gambit, as Black's goals are very different. Black gambits a wing pawn in an attempt to build a strong centre. White can either accept the gambit or decline it to maintain a small positional advantage. Although the Blumenfeld is playable for Black it is not very popular. Catalan Opening: 3.g3  The Catalan Opening features a quick of White's . Others * 3.Nf3 b5 Polish Defence * 3.Nf3 Ne4 Döry Defence (see 1.d4 Nf6 sidelines) * 3.Bg5 Neo- Indian Attack (see 1.d4 Nf6 sidelines) * 3.a3?! Australian Attack =2...g6=Grünfeld Defence: 3.Nc3 d5  Ernst Grünfeld debuted the Grünfeld Defence in 1922. Distinguished by the move 3...d5, Grünfeld intended it as an improvement to the King's Indian which was not considered entirely satisfactory at that time. The Grünfeld has been adopted by World Champions Smyslov, Fischer, and Kasparov. King's Indian Defence: 3.Nc3 Bg7  The King's Indian Defence is aggressive and somewhat risky, and generally indicates that Black will not be satisfied with a draw. Although it was played occasionally as early as the late 19th century, the King's Indian was considered inferior until the 1940s when it was featured in the games of Bronstein, Boleslavsky, and Reshevsky. It was Fischer's favoured defence to 1.d4, but its popularity faded in the mid-1970s. Kasparov's successes with the defence restored the King's Indian to prominence in the 1980s. =2...c5=Benoni Defence The Benoni Defense is a risky attempt by Black to unbalance the position and gain active piece play at the cost of allowing White a pawn wedge at d5 and a central majority. The most common Benoni line is the Modern Benoni (3.d5 e6 4.Nc3). Tal popularised the defence in the 1960s by winning several brilliant games with it, and Bobby Fischer occasionally adopted it, with good results, including a win in his 1972 World Championship match against Boris Spassky. Often Black adopts a slightly different move order, playing 2...e6 before 3...c5 in order to avoid the sharpest lines for White. Benko Gambit (or Volga Gambit): 3.d5 b5  The Benko Gambit (known as the Volga Gambit in Russia and Eastern Europe) is one of Black's most popular ways of meeting 1.d4, though it is less common at elite level. Black plays to open lines on the queenside where White will be subject to considerable pressure. If White accepts the gambit, Black's compensation is positional rather than tactical, and his initiative can last even after many piece exchanges and well into the endgame. White often chooses instead either to decline the gambit pawn or return it. =Other 2nd moves for Black=Old Indian Defence: 2...d6 3.Nc3 e5  The Old Indian Defence was introduced by Tarrasch in 1902, but it is more commonly associated with Chigorin who adopted it five years later. It is similar to the King's Indian in that both feature a ...d6 and ...e5 pawn centre, but in the Old Indian Black's king bishop is developed to e7 rather than being fianchettoed on g7. The Old Indian is solid, but Black's position is usually cramped and it lacks the dynamic possibilities found in the King's Indian. Budapest Gambit: 2...e5  The Budapest Gambit is rarely played in grandmaster games, but more often adopted by amateurs. Although it is a gambit, White cannot hold on to his extra pawn without making compromises in the deployment of his pieces, so he often chooses to return the pawn and retain the initiative. Others * 2...b6 Accelerated Queen's Indian Defence :The Accelerated Queen's Indian Defence is playable, however it is considered less accurate than the standard Queen's Indian move order (2...e6 3 Nf3 b6) due to the possibility of 3.Nc3 Bb7 4.Qc2 d5 (otherwise e4 will follow) 5.cxd5 Nxd5 6.Nf3! and White was better in Alekhine–König, Vienna 1922. James Plaskett and Raymond Keene analyse this line in their 1987 book on the English Defence. * 2...c6 :This normally transposes into the Slav Defence if Black subsequently plays ...d5, however it may also transpose into the Old Indian or even the King's Indian if Black instead follows up with ...d6. One of the few independent lines is the offbeat 2...c6 3.Nf3 b5!?, sometimes called the Kudischewitsch gambit after the Israeli IM David Kudischewitsch. * 2...Nc6 Black Knights' Tango :The Black Knights' Tango or Mexican Defence introduced by Carlos Torre in 1925 in Baden-Baden shares similarities with Alekhine's Defence as Black attempts to induce a premature advance of the white pawns. It may transpose into many other defences. * 2...d6 3.Nc3 Bf5 Janowski Indian Defence * 2...d5?! Marshall Defence :The Marshall Defence (normally reached via the Queen's Gambit after 1.d4 d5 2.c4 Nf6?!) is better for White. 1.d4 Nf6 sidelines * 2.c4 e6 3.Bg5 Neo-Indian Attack * 2.Nf3 and now: ** 2...e6 3.Bg5 Torre Attack ** 2...g6 East Indian Defence ** 2...g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.Bf4 Bg7 5.e3 0-0 6.Be2 Barry Attack **:Another option is the Barry Attack, popular with club players. White usually follows up with Ne5 and h2–h4–h5, a direct attack on the black king. The Barry Attack has also been tried out at grandmaster level by Mark Hebden and Julian Hodgson. ** 2...b6 3.Bg5 Torre Attack ** 2...h6 3.c4 g5 Nadanian Attack **:The Nadanian Attack is an aggressive attempt by Black to unbalance the position. The early 2...h6 and 3...g5 are designed to deal with drawish variations such as Colle System, London System and Torre Attack. The line was introduced in 2005 by Ashot Nadanian, but has never enjoyed widespread popularity among top-flight players. ** 2...Ne4 Döry Defence **:The Döry Defence (2.Nf3 Ne4 or 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Ne4) is uncommon, but was the subject of a theme tournament (won by Paul Keres) in Vienna in 1937. It will sometimes transpose into a variation of the Queen's Indian Defence but there are also independent lines. * 2.Bg5 Trompowsky Attack *:The Neo-Indian Attack, Torre Attack, and Trompowsky Attack are White anti-Indian variations. Related to the Richter–Veresov Attack, they feature an early Bg5 by White and avoid much of the detailed theory of other queen's pawn openings.

It is named after its first findspot: on the Schneiderberg at Baalberge, Salzlandkreis, Saxony-Anhalt. It appears to be the oldest grouping of the Funnelbeaker culture. In Germany it is the most common of the Funnelbeaker cultures. Because of issues with the archaeological use of the term culture it is now often referred to as the Baalberge Ceramic style (Baalberger Keramikstil). It is part of Funnelbeaker phase TRB-MES II and III in the Middle Elbe/Saale region.  History and scholarship  The Schneiderberg in Baalberge is the namesake of the Baalberge Kultur An early example of the Funnelbeaker culture, the Baalberge ceramic style dates between 3800 - 3400 BC and belongs to the central German funnelbeaker phases TRB-MES II (3800-3500 BC) and TRB-MES III (3500-3350 BC). It developed out of phase TRB-MES I (4100-3800 BC), innovating under the influence of southeaster and western influences (Michelsberg culture and the late Lengyel culture). A more complex society developed after 3350 BC in the TRB-MES IV phase, with distinct decorative styles (Salzmünd group and Walternienburg-Bernburg Culture). The Baalberge culture was first identified as a distinct group on the grounds of pottery types by Nils Niklasson and Paul Kupka. Before this it had been included in the Bernburg type.Nils Niklasson. Studien über die Walternienburg- Bernburger Kultur 1 (= Jahresschrift für mitteldeutsche Vorgeschichte, Band 13). Halle (Saale) 1925. Kupka grouped the finds belonging to the Baalberge culture together under the name \\"Central German Stilthouse Pottery\\" (mitteldeutsche Pfahlbaukeramik).Paul Kupka. \\"Alter, Wesen und Verbreitung der mitteldeutschen Steinzeittonware. Nachträgliches und Ergänzendes.\\" Beiträge zur Geschichte, Landes und Volkskunde der Altmark, Vol. 5 (1925–1930), 1928, pp. 201–262. Paul Grimm followed this with the first division of the material into Early, High, Late and Pre-Unetice periods in 1937.Paul Grimm. \\"Die Baalberger Kultur in Mitteldeutschland.\\" Mannus, Vol. 19, 1937, pp. 155–187. Paul Kupka and C.J. Becker put the Baalberg group in parallel with the northern Funnelbeaker culture. Joachim Preuß divided the Baalberg culture into an older and later phase using burial practices and pottery typologies.Joachim Preuß. \\"Die chronologische Stellung der Baalberger, Salzmünder und Walternienburger Gruppe innerhalb der Trichterbecherkultur Mitteldeutschlands.\\" in Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic (Ed.). L'Europe à la fin de l'âge de la pierre: Actes du Symposium consacré aux problèmes du Néolithique européen, Prague, Liblice, Brno 5.-12.10.1959. Prag 1961, pp. 405–413. Scientific data indicates however that the divisions do not indicate chronological differences. According to Johannes Müller they instead show different social groups.Johannes Müller. Soziochronologische Studien zum Jung- und Spätneolithikum im Mittelelbe-Saale-Gebiet (4100-2700 v. Chr.) (Vorgeschichtliche Forschungen Vol. 21). Rahden, Leidorf 2001. Marija Gimbutas and her followers argue that the Baalberg culture was an intrusive hybrid culture deriving ultimately from the Eurasian steppe, part of the Kurgan hypothesis. In that case it would have been an Indo-European-speaking culture. Some aspects of Baalberge burials might support this theory, such as the presence of pottery allegedly influenced by the Baden culture (an Indo- Europeanised culture according to Gimbutas) and the Bodrogkersztúr culture and the posture of the corpses, laid on their right hand side with their legs pulled up - a posture typical of the \\"Yamna culture.\\" But other aspects of the burials are very different from burials in the east, such as the placement of the hands over the mouth in an eating gesture (which is unknown in authentic kurgan sites) and the much less marked use of red ochre. In particular, there are no signs of the steppe kurgans that characterise the Kurgan culture. Finally, comparative anatomy suggests the deceased came from a locally derived population, not from the east. Mallory therefore considers the Baalberge group a local development.Mallory, \\"Baalberge group\\", Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture, Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997.  Distribution  The main distribution area is the central Elbe-Saale region. Further finds occur in Mecklenburg- Vorpommern und Brandenburg. A distinctive variant is also known from Bohemia, of which numerous individual finds occur from Bohemia into Lower Austria. The distribution area extends further to the north than that of the Rössen culture. The whole settlement area is self-contained.  Settlements  Settlements are only barely known. Usually they contain waste pits with characteristic material (clay, stone, bone material), hearths, and the postholes of a few individual houses in rather extended settlements (Braunsdorf, Merseburg). Houses are rectangular or square and of medium size. Pit-houses are rectangular or oval. Other pits were used for storage, waste disposal and sacrifices. A large settlement in Pirkau, Hohenmölsen was found in emergency excavations but provides no evidence of houses. There were also finds at the settlement built at Dölauer Heide in Halle which is surrounded by an embankment.Dieter Kaufmann & Arno Brömme. \\"Ein Gräberkomplex der Baalberger Gruppe in der Dölauer Heide bei Halle (Saale).\\" Jahresschrift für mitteldeutsche Vorgeschichte, Vol. 56, 1972, pp. 39–57.  Material culture  Winningen, Saxony-Anhalt; Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte, Berlin The Baalberge group is largely made up of undecorated wares with clearly defined neck, shoulder and lower parts. They have a very round profile, varying between egg-shaped, biconical, and bulbous, with clearly differentiated bases. Incised and stamped patterns occur around the neck and shoulder. The pottery types, generally used as funerary items, were very well represented at Dölauer Heide in Halle.Dieter Kaufmann & Arno Brömme. \\"Ein Gräberkomplex der Baalberger Gruppe in der Dölauer Heide bei Halle (Saale).\\" Jahresschrift für mitteldeutsche Vorgeschichte, Vol. 56, 1972, pp. 39–57. A grey-brown leatherlike finish is typical of the Baalberge culture. When broken, the sherds reveal a dark grey to black fabric. The complete ceramic inventory forms a self-contained type region in the usage area of the Baalberg culture. The main forms are: *Amphorae: with two, four and multiple handles *Pitchers: Baalberg is the first culture which has pitchers. The necks are usually trefoil shaped. *Cups: usually with small footprints. *Funnelbeakers: tall and slim with small footprints *Bowls: angle-lipped bowls, wide funnel lip bowls with distinct feet and carinated bowls *Pottery tools: ladles and spoons Stone tools: *Short, squat, round-necked axes from Chörau in Köthen and Warle in Wolfenbüttel, *Flat stone hatchets with rounded rectangular cross-sections, *Flint tools like crosscutters, three-point arrow heads (Quenstedt, Hettstedt),Erhard Schröter. \\"Baalberger Gräber auf der Schalkenburg bei Quenstedt, Kr.

The metal finds associated with the Baalberge culture are among the oldest in the central German Neolithic.For the sources of this section see under Material Culture in the Bibliography below  Economy  The economy was unspecialised agriculture and pastoralism. Crops included emmer, einkorn, dwarf wheat, and barley. Animals included cattle, pigs, sheep and goats.  Graves and funerary sites  The graves are mostly individual. A large graveyard was found at Zauschwitz, Borna. Double graves and pit graves are also known (e.g. Schalkenburg, Quenstedt).Erhard Schröter. \\"Baalberger Gräber auf der Schalkenburg bei Quenstedt, Kr. Hettstedt.\\" Ausgrabungen und Funde, Vol. 21, 1976, pp. 229–233. Unusual forms include settlement burials and partial burials. In addition to simple earth graves, innovative forms with architectural elements also appear. The first tumulus graves in central Germany also come from this culture. Baalberge is the first culture in which megalithic influences in the form of grave complexes, tumulus enclosures, and cists can be detected. At the same time, heavy cits sunk in the ground or raised above it and slab graves are rare. Other grave elements can be detected, such as stone packing, wooden fittings and the combination of stone and wooden components. Tumulus graves contain earth and stone cist graves as primary burials. In the gravemound at Latdorf in Bernburg, a narrow stone cist was found which was surrounded by a 25 metre long trapezoidal barrow.Großsteingrab Bierberg bei Latdorf The earthen graves of the Baalberge culture usually contain inhumations, with the bodies nearly always laid out on a west-east orientation flexed on their right side. Some inhumations were enclosed in square or trapezoidal ditches.Kirstin Funke. Die Trapezgrabenanlagen der Baalberger Kultur von Großlehna-Altranstädt und Zwenkau, Lkr. Leipziger Land. 2 Vols., Halle (Saale) 2000. In 1966, J. Preuß recorded 116 grave-complexes in the central German habitation area.Joachim Preuß. Das Neolithikum in Mitteleuropa. Kulturen - Wirtschaft - Umwelt vom 6. bis 3. Jahrtausend v. u. Z. (Weißenbach, Beier und Beran 1996). The grave- complex at Stemmem excavated by W. Matthias in 1952 is 16.4 m long and squared at both ends and was the first enclosure grave recognised as a Baalberge burial. In 1983, G. Möbes published a number of new finds from Thuringia. In Großbrembach in Sömmerda a nearly square complex with rounded corners measuring 10.8 x 10.4 metres contains two crouching inhumations lying on their right sides and oriented south-north. The grave ditch was described as partially flat, partially trough shaped. Bright bands in the soil filling seem to indicate the inflow of water. Unetice stone packed graves around it indicate that the flat barrow must have remained well known. A similar complex was investigated in 1974 at Sommerberg near Großfahner in the proximity of Erfurt. It was a 19/17 x 15.5/14.5 metre trapezoid containing a 2.3 metre wide grave. The west side was overlapped by a small burial hut of the Corded Ware culture with several skeletons. This Corded Ware grave in the centre also shows that the main tomb must have remained well known even 1000 years after its construction. This reuse by later cultures, including the Globular Amphora culture and the Unetice culture, is common. Pottery was found as grave goods, including combinations of pitchers and cups.  Religion and Cult  A belief in an afterlife (perhaps in the grave) is suggested by the grave goods. Cultic finds include charred remains of human and animal skeletons in a pit at Melchendorf in Erfurt. At Wansleben in Eilsleben an upright human skull between two sandstone plates and below a plate covered in cattle horns attests to the practice of skull deposition. Genetics A November 2015 genetic study published in Nature included an analysis of three individuals of the Baalberge group. The two males surveyed were found to be carriers of the paternal haplogroups I and R1b1a.  Bibliography  General Overview * Hermann Behrens.

Early colonial history An 1898 stamp of Macau commemorating the quatercentenary of Vasco de Gama's discovery of the sea route to India The first stamps issued for Macau, appearing in 1884, used the common \\"Portuguese crown\\" design for nine values ranging from 5 to 300 reis. Later in 1884, an 80-reis value was produced as a surcharge on the 100-reis value; in 1885 an 80-reis value of the crown design went on sale. Also in 1885, five values were re-issued in new colors. Shortages of values continued through 1887, resulting in a variety of surcharges on both postage stamps and revenue stamps.https://web.archive.org/web/20180303051337/http://www.stampworldhistory.com/country- profiles-2/asia/macau-%E6%BE%B3%E9%96%80/ Retrieved 12 August 2018. New stamps in 1888 depicted Luis I with an embossed profile. Luis died soon after, and in 1894 a new series of 12 values featured a portrait of Carlos I. Also in 1894 the currency was changed to avos and rupees, 78 avos to the rupee (this would change to 100 avos to the pataca in 1913). In response leftover Luis stamps were surcharged in various avos values, in both Latin and Chinese characters, along with the word \\"PROVISORIO\\". In 1898 both the Vasco da Gama issue of commemoratives, and a new series of Carlos designs, were all denominated in avos. Shortages of particular values were a regular occurrence from 1900 through 1910, resulting in nearly 40 types of surcharges, as well as postage due stamps pressed into regular service by overprinting obliterating bars on the \\"PORTEADO\\" and \\"RECEBER\\" text of those stamps. Post-revolution history A 1913 Ceres stamp of Macau In the wake of the revolution of 1910, the government overprinted stocks of the Carlos stamps with \\"REPUBLICA\\" and shipped those out to Macau. The turbulent situation required some creativity on the part of local officials, and in 1911, they produced 2a and 5a values by overprinting the new value diagonally in upper right and lower left corners of 4a and 10a stamps, then bisecting them on the diagonal. In 1913, they also applied a Republica overprint to a variety of older stamps going back to 1898. The Ceres series of 1913 was a fresh start for all the Portuguese territories, ultimately adding up to 29 value/color combinations (up to 5 patacas) through 1924. Even so, in 1915 additional Republica overprints were needed on the surcharges of 1902 (themselves overprinted on 1888 and 1894 issues. Between 1931 and 1933, nine lesser-used values of the Ceres stamps were surcharged. On 1 February 1934, a new definitive series used a design with an allegorical figure representing \\"Portugal\\" and Vasco da Gama's flagship São Gabriel. They were surcharged in 1941, and eight values were reprinted in 1942. The reprints were lithographed (instead of typographed as were the 1934 printings) on a thin paper, roughly perforated. Macau participated in the Empire issue of 1938, with 17 values. In 1948, a new definitive series consisted of 12 values with different pictorial designs depicting local scenery. Subsequent issues included many of the common design types issued for all the Portuguese territories, with some commemoratives for anniversaries in Macau. Macau's 1976 acquisition of \\"special territory\\" status gave it more autonomy in its handling of the post, and starting in 1981 it issued a variety of more- appealing designs relating to local geography and culture, generally in sets of 4-6 related designs. Post-transfer of sovereignty history A 2014 stamp of Macau The main effect of the 1999 transition to special administrative region status was a change in the inscription on the stamps: from \\"MACAU\\" along with \\"REPÚBLICA PORTUGUESA\\" in smaller print somewhere on the stamp, to \\"MACAU, CHINA\\".

During his life he wrote for virtually every major English language film publication. In 1965 he published the first major critical essay on Michael Powell, who had hitherto been \\"fashionably dismissed by critics as a 'technician’s director'\\", as Durgnat put it. His many books include Films and Feelings (1967), A Mirror for England: British Movies from Austerity to Affluence (1970), and The Strange Case of Alfred Hitchcock (1974). He wrote principally for Films and Filming (in the 1960s), Film Comment (in the 1970s) and Monthly Film Bulletin (in the 1980s), and taught at various art schools and universities, notably St Martin's College and the Royal College of Art, where his students included Tony Scott. Toward the end of his life he was visiting professor at the University of East London. Biography Durgnat was born in London in 1932 to Swiss parents who had emigrated to England in 1924.Raymond Durgnat: Prolific film critic contemptuous of his trade's doctrinal theories. Durgnat's family was of French Huguenot descent, and he was raised in a religious Calvinist household.\\"Culture Always is a Fog:\\" Interview with Raymond Durgnat. Rouge. Durgnat's father worked as a window dresser but lost his job in 1932; afterwards, he opened a drapery shop. He was educated at the Sir George Monoux School, a state grammar school in Walthamstow, before serving his statutory two years of National Service, which he spent in the Education Corps in Hong Kong, then a British possession. After leaving the army in 1954, he studied English literature at Pembroke College, Cambridge. With the filmmaker Don Levy, Durgnat became one of the first post-graduate students of film in Britain, studying under Thorold Dickinson (director of Gaslight and The Next of Kin) at the Slade School of Fine Art from 1960. The thesis he wrote there provided the source material for a number of his books. In the early 1950s, he had written for Sight and Sound, but fell out with this British Film Institute publication after the exit of Gavin Lambert in 1957, often accusing it of elitism, puritanism, and upper-middle-class snobbery, notably in his 1963 essay \\"Standing Up For Jesus\\" (which appeared in the short-lived magazine Motion, which he co-edited with Ian Johnson) and in his 1965 piece \\"Auteurs and Dream Factories\\" (an edited version of which later appeared in Films and Feelings). From 1960 he was a regular presence in the monthly Films and Filming, writing reviews and serial essays. In 1966–7 he was a major player in the nascent London Film-Makers' Co-op (LFMC),Kevin Gough-Yates Obituary: Raymond Durgnat, The Guardian, 24 May 2002 then based at Better Books on Charing Cross Road, a hub of the emerging British underground. As the LFMC's chairman he was instrumental in promoting filmmakers such as Jeff Keen and Stephen Dwoskin, writing the first articles on both. The rise of structural film (at the LFMC) and of structuralism (in the journal Screen) – and the far- left politics which accompanied the latter – saw Durgnat become an outsider figure within British film culture. In 1973 he moved to Canada, beginning a peripatetic teaching career in North America which took him to New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. In the late 1970s he taught film at the University of California, San Diego alongside Manny Farber, Jean-Pierre Gorin and Jonathan Rosenbaum.Rosenbaum, Jonathan. They Drive by Night: The Criticism of Manny Farber. Returning to London at the close of the decade, he launched a series of withering assaults on the linguistics-based film theory that had come to dominate film academia over the previous decade; perhaps as a result, he did not published another new book until 1999. He did, however, return to write for the BFI publication Monthly Film Bulletin in the years before its merger with Sight and Sound in 1991, and contributed to that publication again later in the 1990s. His last two books, including A Long Hard look at Psycho, were also published by the BFI. The Essential Raymond Durgnat, published in 2014 – again by the BFI – contains previously unpublished work, including a translation of an essay originally published in Positif on Michael Powell, on whom Durgnat began but did not complete a full-length book. It also includes such rare pieces as \\"Standing Up for Jesus\\". The collection was described by Adrian Martin as \\"the essential film book of this or almost any year\\". Durgnat's socio-political approach – strongly supportive of the working classes and, almost as a direct result of this, American popular culture, and dismissive of left-wing intellectuals whom he accused of actually being petit- bourgeois conservatives in disguise, and dismissive of overt politicisation of film criticism, refusing to bring his own left-wing views overtly into his writings on film – can best be described as \\"radical populist\\".

The Battle of Galveston was a naval and land battle of the American Civil War, when Confederate forces under Major Gen. John B. Magruder expelled occupying Union troops from the city of Galveston, Texas on January 1, 1863. After the loss of the cutter , the Union Fleet Commander William B. Renshaw blew up the stranded vessel to save it from falling into enemy hands. Union troops on shore thought the fleet was surrendering, and laid down their arms. The battle is sometimes called the Second Battle of Galveston, as the Battle of Galveston Harbor (October 1862) is sometimes called the First Battle of Galveston. Battle Two Confederate cottonclads, and the commanded by Leon Smith, sailed from Houston to Galveston in an effort to engage the Union Fleet in Galveston Harbor, which consisted of , , , , and . Outnumbered six to two by the Northern ships, Neptune was severely damaged by the Union Fleet and eventually sank. While Neptune was quickly disabled, Bayou City succeeded in capturing . During this time, was grounded on a sandbar. A three-hour truce was called for by Magruder, but Union Fleet Commander William B. Renshaw, ignoring the negotiation offer, attempted to destroy the grounded Westfield with explosives rather than let it fall into enemy hands. Renshaw and several Union troops were subsequently killed when the explosives were set off too early. Union troops on shore were convinced that their own ships were surrendering and, therefore, laid down their arms. The remaining U.S. ships did not surrender and succeeded in retreating to Union-controlled New Orleans. Aftermath The Union blockade around the city of Galveston was lifted temporarily for four days, and Galveston remained the only major port that remained in Confederate hands at the end of the war. The Confederate Congress stated this on the successful recapture of Galveston: > The bold, intrepid, and gallant conduct of Maj. Gen. J. Bankhead Magruder, > Col. Thomas Green, Maj. Leon Smith and other officers, and of the Texan > Rangers and soldiers engaged in the attack on, and victory achieved over, > the land and naval forces of the enemy at Galveston, on the 1st of January, > 1863, eminently entitle them to the thanks of Congress and the country... > This brilliant achievement, resulting, under the providence of God, in the > capture of the war steamer Harriet Lane and the defeat and ignominious > flight of the hostile fleet from the harbor, the recapture of the city and > the raising of the blockade of the port of Galveston, signally evinces that > superior force may be overcome by skillful conception and daring courage.

As the leader of various dance bands that recorded as early as March 1927 and continuing through at least 1940, Light and his band primarily worked in various hotels in New York. For a time in 1928 he also led a band in Paris. In the 1930s Light also studied conducting with the French conductor Maurice Frigara in Paris.Enoch Light, the Master of Sound. Billboard, 18 February 1967. Throughout the 1930s, Light and his outfits were steadily employed in the generally more upscale hotel restaurants and ballrooms in New York that catered to providing polite ambiance for dining and functional dance music of current popular songs rather than out-and-out jazz. At some point his band was tagged \\"The Light Brigade\\" and they often broadcast over radio live from the Hotel Taft in New York where they had a long residency. Through 1940, Light and his band recorded for various labels including Brunswick, ARC, Vocalion and Bluebird. Later on, as A&R; (Artists and Repertoire) chief and vice-president of Grand Award Records, he founded his own label, Command Records, in 1959. Light's name was prominent on many albums both as musician and producer. Biography Light is credited with being one of the first musicians to go to extreme lengths to create high- quality recordings that took full advantage of the technical capabilities of home audio equipment of the late 1950s and early 1960s, particularly stereo effects that bounced the sounds between the right and left channels (often described as \\"Ping-pong recording\\"), which had huge influence on the whole concept of multi-track recording that would become commonplace in the ensuing years. Doing so, he arranged his musicians in ways to produce the kinds of recorded sounds he wished to achieve, even completely isolating various groups of them from each other in the recording studio. The first of the albums produced on his record label, Command Records, Persuasive Percussion, became one of the first big-hit LP discs based solely on retail sales. His music received little or no airplay on the radio, because AM radio, the standard of the day, was monaural and had very poor fidelity. Light went on to release several albums in the Persuasive Percussion series, as well as a Command test record. The album covers were generally designed with abstract, minimalist artwork that stood out boldly from other album covers. These pieces were usually the work of Josef Albers. Light was so interested in the sound of his music that he would include lengthy prose describing each song's sounds. In order to fit all of his descriptions on to the album sleeve, he doubled the size of the sleeve but enabled it to fold like a book, thus popularizing the gatefold packaging format. The gatefold sleeve became extremely popular in later decades, and was used on albums such as The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Enoch Light released myriad albums in various genres of music under a variety of names during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Some were released under Grand Award Records, a subsidiary label he founded earlier. The music was intended for older audiences, presumably because he saw them as more-serious audiophiles who had more money to spend on high end stereo equipment, as opposed to most popular music of the time, which was generally intended for teenagers and young adults. During this time, he pioneered many recording techniques such as the use of 35 mm magnetic film instead of magnetic tape, thereby reducing the effects of \\"wow\\" and \\"flutter\\". The recordings were released under the \\"35MM\\" series, starting from \\"Stereo 35-MM\\" released by Command Records. Musicians who appeared on Light's albums include The Free Design, The Critters, Rain, Doc Severinsen, Tony Mottola, Dick Hyman, organist Virgil Fox (on the Wanamaker Organ). As an arranger, Lew Davies was one of the label's most important contributors. In 1965, Light sold the Command record label, which had released the Persuasive Percussion series, to ABC Records, which itself was subsequently sold to MCA Records. After the sale, the quality of those records plummeted dramatically. The signature gatefold format (along with Light's prose) was immediately discontinued, and the covers changed to budget labels pressed on recycled vinyl. In 1975, they were completely discontinued. After the sale of Command Records, Light launched a new label called Project 3 and continued recording, but did not concentrate so heavily on stereo effects. Light recorded several successful big band albums with an ace-group of New York studio musicians, many of whom were veterans of the bands of the Swing Era who were still regularly working in New York's television and recording studios. Released as Enoch Light and the Light Brigade, the arrangements used on the recordings were transcribed note-for-note from some of what were the hallmark recordings by many of the best bands of the swing era. The arranging reconstructions of these now \\"classic\\" arrangements were completely reconstructed by arrangers Dick Lieb, Dick Hyman, Tony Mottola and Jeff Hest. Many of the musicians employed for this series of \\"recreations\\" had been members of the original bands that made the original records decades earlier. This veritable \\"Who's Who\\" of \\"swing era\\" veteran musicians included saxophonists Phil Bodner, Walt Levinsky, (both also heavily featured on clarinet), Ray Beckenstein, Gerald Sanfino, Al Klink, Boomie Richman, Romeo Penque, and Sol Schlinger; trumpeters Mel Davis, Rusty Dedrick, Johnny Frosk, Bernie Glow, Joe Graves, Markie Markowicz, Bob McCoy, and Marvin Stamm; trombonists Wayne Andre, Paul Fralise, Urbie Green, Lou McGarity, Buddy Morrow, and Santo Russo; guitarist Tony Mottola, bassists Bob Haggart and George Duvivier, drummers Don Lamond, Bob Rosengarden and Ronnie Zito, pianists Dick Hyman and Derek Smith and vibraharpist Phil Kraus. Light retired from music entirely in 1974 and died four years later. =Legacy= Light released 25 albums over 12 years (1959–71), with two of them reaching number one on the U.S. Billboard album chart. He holds the record for having the most charting LPs without having a Top 40 single, as reported by Casey Kasem on the American Top 40 broadcast of 14 October 1978. Events coinciding with Light's birthday near his birthplace of northeastern Ohio have occurred since the late 1990s. The most recent is 2014's Enoch Light Birthday Memorial Go-Go Happening and features bands performing Light's work and multimedia installations remixing the distinctive Command Records album cover designs. On 25 June 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Enoch Light among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

A gatefold is a type of fold used for advertising around a magazine or section, and for packaging of media such as in the phonographic industry. LP covers A gatefold cover or gatefold LP is a form of packaging for LP records which became popular in the mid-1960s. A gatefold cover, when folded, is the same size as a standard LP cover (i.e. a 12½ inch, or 32.7 centimetre, square). The larger gatefold cover provided a means of including artwork, liner notes, and/or song lyrics which would otherwise not have fit on a standard record cover. It became famous as an extension of progressive rock, as the expansive, transient gatefolds by artists such as Roger Dean, H. R. Giger, or Hipgnosis became associated with concept albums. Gatefold sleeves were also frequently used when an album contained more than one record, with Bob Dylan's 1966 double album Blonde on Blonde being the first multi-LP album to be released in a gatefold. Typically, double albums would feature one disc in each half of the cover, with larger albums either placing multiple LPs in one or both sleeves or using larger gatefolds. While some multi-LP releases (particularly those released during the vinyl record's market dormancy from 1988 to 2007) would either package the discs in a simple sleeve or sandwich the records between two cards and shrinkwrap, the prominence of gatefold for multi-LP albums led it to become the most common form of packaging for them. Starting in the early 1950s, RCA used gatefold packaging for some of their deluxe 45 RPM single releases, such as Nat King Cole's 8-song \\"Unforgettable\\" EP with two 45s, released in 1952. Gatefold packaging for LPs was popularized in the late 1950s by band leader and stereophonic studio recording pioneer Enoch Light, so he could fit liner notes he had written describing the sounds in each song on the album sleeve. Disagreement exists as to the identity of the first gatefold LP packaging used with a traditional 33⅓ LP. In recent years, the LP gatefold has been adapted to package CDs without a jewelcase. The LP gatefold (laid out flat) from the original U.S. 1973 LP of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon. In other publishing Gatefold ads and highlights are often used as extensions of the covers of publications, folded either outside to overlap the cover or inside to unfold when the cover is opened. Similar folds include the split gatefold and the spadea.

While there are several modern bridges near the site of the battle, the original bridge was in poor shape in 1777, and did not survive the American Revolution. Battle of Cooch's Bridge Fought on September 3, 1777, the Battle of Cooch's Bridge has two principal distinctions. It was the only battle of the American Revolutionary War fought on Delaware soil, and marked the first time that the Stars and Stripes was flown in battle. The battle was fought between British and Hessian troops under Generals Cornwallis, Howe, and Knyphausen and the Colonial troops under General Washington. The engagement began August 30, about two miles (3 km) south of the bridge. The Americans harried the lead forces of the British Army using guerrilla techniques learned from the Native Americans. However, the roughly 700 Colonials were greatly outmanned and outgunned, and were driven back by the advancing British. By September 3, the Colonials had dropped back to Cooch's Bridge. A handpicked regiment of 100 marksmen under General William Maxwell laid an ambush in the surrounding cover. Over the ensuing battle, several British and Hessian charges were repelled, but the Americans soon depleted their ammunition and called a retreat. The property was taken by the British and several buildings were burned. General Cornwallis used the Cooch house as his headquarters for the next week as the British regrouped. American casualties numbered around 30. Shortly after General Howe moved his troops out. On September 11 he defeated the Colonials in the Battle of Brandywine and subsequently captured the Colonial capital of Philadelphia.

Death After years of ill health, French died of a heart attack on 27 October 2015, aged 82. Speaking after his death, The Observer editor John Mulholland said that French was \\"a giant figure\\" in the paper's history and \\"part of its soul for the past 50 years\\", adding: > He was a brilliant critic whose erudition and judgement were respected by > generations of cinema lovers and film-makers alike.

In the mid-1900s, it was used in conjunction with an anesthetic to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. It is now rarely used as an adjunct for clinical anesthesia because safer alternatives, such as cisatracurium and rocuronium, are available.  History  Tubocurarine is a naturally occurring mono-quaternary alkaloid obtained from the bark of the Menispermaceous South American plant Chondrodendron tomentosum, a climbing vine known to the European world since the Spanish conquest of South America. Curare had been used as a source of arrow poison by South American natives to hunt animals, and they were able to eat the animals' contaminated flesh subsequently without any adverse effects because tubocurarine cannot easily cross mucous membranes.Thus, tubocurarine is effective only if given parenterally, as demonstrated by Bernard, who also showed that the site of its action was at the neuromuscular junction. Virchow and Munter confirmed the paralyzing action was limited to voluntary muscles. =Etymology= The word \\"curare\\" comes from the South American Native name for the arrow poison, ourare. Presumably, the initial syllable was pronounced with a heavy glottal stop. Tubocurarine is so- called because some of the plant extracts designated 'curare' were stored, and subsequently shipped to Europe, in bamboo tubes. Likewise, curare stored in calabash containers was called calabash curare, although this was usually an extract not of Chondrodendron, but of the Strychnos species S. toxifera, containing a different alkaloid, namely toxiferine. Pot curare was generally a mixture of extracts from various genera in the families Menispermaceae and Strychnaceae. The tripartite classification into 'tube' , 'calabash' and 'pot' curares early became untenable, due to inconsistencies in the use of the different types of vessels and the complexities of the dart poison recipes themselves.The Alkaloids : Chemistry and Physiology ed. R.H.F. Manske ( Dominion Rubber Research Laboratory Guelph, Ontario ) Academic Press inc., publishers New York 1955 Volume 5 : Pharmacology =Use as an anesthetic= Griffith and Johnson are credited with pioneering the formal clinical introduction of tubocurarine as an adjunct to anesthetic practice on 23 January 1942, at the Montreal Homeopathic Hospital. In this sense, tubocurarine is the prototypical adjunctive neuromuscular non-depolarizing agent. However, others before Griffith and Johnson had attempted use of tubocurarine in several situations: some under controlled study conditions while others not quite controlled and remained unpublished. Regardless, all in all some 30,000 patients had been given tubocurarine by 1941, although it was Griffith and Johnson's 1942 publication that provided the impetus to the standard use of neuromuscular blocking agents in clinical anesthestic practice – a revolution that rapidly metamorphosized into the standard practice of \\"balanced\\" anesthesia: the triad of barbiturate hypnosis, light inhalational anesthesia and muscle relaxation. The technique as described by Gray and Halton was widely known as the \\"Liverpool technique\\", and became the standard anesthetic technique in England in the 1950s and 1960s for patients of all ages and physical status. Present clinical anesthetic practice still employs the central principle of balanced anesthesia though with some differences to accommodate subsequent technological advances and introductions of new and better gaseous anesthetic, hypnotic and neuromuscular blocking agents, and tracheal intubation, as well as monitoring techniques that were nonexistent in the day of Gray and Halton: pulse oximetry, capnography, peripheral nerve stimulation, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring, etc.  Chemical properties  Structurally, tubocurarine is a benzylisoquinoline derivative. For many years, its structure, when first elucidated in 1948, was wrongly thought to be bis-quaternary: in other words, it was thought to be an N,N-dimethylated alkaloid. In 1970, the correct structure was finally established, showing one of the two nitrogens to be tertiary, actually a mono- N-methylated alkaloid. = Biosynthesis = Tubocurarine biosynthesis involves a radical coupling of the two enantiomers of N-methylcoclaurine. (R) and (S)-N-methylcoclaurine come from a Mannich-like reaction between dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, facilitated by norcoclaurine synthase (NCS). Both dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde originate from L-tyrosine. Methylation of the amine and hydroxyl substituents are facilitated by S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). One methyl group is present on each nitrogen atom prior to the radical coupling. The additional methyl group is transferred to form tubocurarine, with its single quaternary N,N-dimethylamino group.Dewick, P. M. Medicinal Natural Products; a Biosynthetic Approach. 3rd ed.; John Wiley and Sons Ltd.: 2009. Tubocurarine proposed biosynthesis  Biological effects  Acetylcholine in the synaptic gap Without intervention, acetylcholine (ACh) in the peripheral nervous system activates skeletal muscles. Acetylcholine is produced in the body of the neuron by choline acetyltransferase and transported down the axon to the synaptic gap. Tubocurarine chloride acts as an antagonist for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChr), meaning it blocks the receptor site from ACh. This may be due to the quaternary amino structural motif found on both molecules. =Clinical pharmacology= Unna et al. reported the effects of tubocurarine on humans: \\"Forty-five seconds after the beginning of the injection, heaviness of the eyelids and transitory diplopia were perceived. At the completion of the injection, diplopia became fixed, but could be noticed only when the subject’s eyelids were raised by the operator. As curarization proceeded, it seemed to the subject as if the facial muscles, those of the tongue, pharynx, and lower jaw, the muscles of the neck and back, and the muscles of the extremities became relaxed in about that order. Accompanying the paralysis of the pharynx and the jaw muscles, inability of the subject to swallow was noted … Shortly after the injection was completed the subjects experienced a sensation of increased difficulty in breathing, as if an extra effort was necessary to maintain an adequate respiratory exchange. This sensation was present even though there was no objective evidence of impaired oxygenation or of carbon dioxide retention. It reached its maximum about five minutes after the injection, coinciding with the maximum depression of the vital capacity. In the majority of the experiments the respiratory rate was increased by about 50–100 per cent the first minutes after the injection of any one of the drugs while the tidal volume decreased.\\" Tubocurarine has a time of onset of around 5 minutes which is relatively slow among neuromuscular-blocking drugs, and has a duration of action of 60 to 120 minutes.Page 151 in: It also causes histamine release,Maclagen J. (1976) In: Zaimis E. (Ed.), \\"Neuromuscular Junction\\". Hand. Exp. Pharm.; Vol. 42; Springer-Verlag, Berlin: 421–486. now a recognized hallmark of the tetrahydroisioquinolinium class of neuromuscular blocking agents. Histamine release is associated with bronchospasms, hypotension, salivary secretions, making it dangerous for asthmatics, children, and those who are pregnant or lactating. However, the main disadvantage in the use of tubocurarine is its significant ganglion-blocking effect, that manifests as hypotension, in many patients; this constitutes a relative contraindication to its use in patients with myocardial ischaemia. Because of the shortcomings of tubocurare, much research effort was undertaken soon after its clinical introduction to find a suitable replacement. The efforts unleashed a multitude of compounds borne from structure-activity relations developed from the tubocurare molecule. Some key compounds that have seen clinical use are identified in the muscle relaxants template box below. Of the many tried as replacements, only a few enjoyed as much popularity as tubocurarine: pancuronium, vecuronium, rocuronium, atracurium, and cisatracurium. Succinylcholine is a widely used muscle relaxant drug which acts by activating, instead of blocking, the ACh receptor. The potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA) has been shown to reverse the effects of tubocurarine. It is thought to do so by increasing ACh release, which counteracts the antagonistic effects of tubocurarine on the ACh receptor. =Use as spider bite treatment= Spiders of the genus Latrodectus have α-latrotoxin in their venom. The most well known spider in this genus is the black widow spider. α-latrotoxin causes the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic gap, including acetylcholine. Bites are usually not fatal, but do cause a significant amount of pain in addition to muscle spasms. The venom is the most damaging to nerve endings, but the introduction of d-tubocurarine chloride blocks the nAChr, alleviating pain and muscle spasms while an antivenom can be administered. Toxicology An individual administered tubocurarine chloride will be unable to move any voluntary muscles, including the diaphragm. A large enough dose will therefore result in death from respiratory failure unless artificial ventilation is initiated. The LD50 for mice and rabbits are 0.13 mg/kg and 0.146 mg/kg intravenously, respectively. It releases histamine and causes hypotension.

The intent behind the Act is to prevent unauthorized negotiations from undermining the government's position. The Act was passed following Senator George Logan's unauthorized negotiations with France in 1798, and was signed into law by President John Adams on January 30, 1799. The Act was amended in 1994, changing the penalty for violation from \\"fined $5,000\\" to \\"fined under this title\\"; this appears to be the only amendment to the Act. Violation of the Logan Act is a felony. Only two people have ever been indicted on charges of violating the Act,Duda, Jeremy (2017-06-13). \\"A Foreign Affair\\". History Today. one in 1802 and the other in 1852. Neither was convicted of violating the Act. History In 1798, amid tensions between the U.S. and France, President Adams sent three envoys to France to negotiate. Negotiations were unsuccessful. Dr. George Logan of Pennsylvania, a state legislator and pacifist, in 1798 engaged in negotiations with France as a private citizen during the Quasi-War. Kevin Kearney, writing in a case comment for the Emory Law Journal, described Dr. Logan's activities in France: Despite the apparent success of Logan's mission, his activities aroused the opposition of the Federalist Party in Congress, who were resentful of the praise showered on Logan by oppositional Democratic-Republican newspapers. Secretary of State Timothy Pickering, also of Pennsylvania, responded by suggesting that Congress \\"act to curb the temerity and impudence of individuals affecting to interfere in public affairs between France and the United States.\\" The result was that Rep. Roger Griswold introduced the Logan Act. It was pushed through by the Federalist majority in Congress by votes of 58–36 in the House and 18–2 in the Senate. Logan himself could not be punished by the Logan law, since the Constitution does not allow ex post facto, or retroactive laws: that is, laws that punish a person for actions taken before the law was enacted, and that were not illegal at the time they were committed. Rather, the intent was to discourage future Logans from conducting foreign policy at cross purposes with the current administration. Subsequently, Logan himself was appointed and then elected as a Democratic- Republican to the United States Senate from Pennsylvania, and served from July 13, 1801, to March 3, 1807. He was unsuccessful in getting the Logan Act repealed. Despite the Logan Act, he went to England in 1810 on a private diplomatic mission as an emissary of peace in the period before the outbreak of the War of 1812, but was not successful. During the nineteenth century, the act lay dormant, partly because American foreign policy receded in importance as an issue. During the twentieth century, however, with the Supreme Court paying greater attention to cases involving the First and Fifth amendments to the Constitution, and with the possibility of American foreign policy being more influenced by private individuals becoming more of a prominent issue in politics, there have been more cases potentially involving the Logan Act. Still, the Logan Act has been rarely enforced, possibly because prosecutors have been concerned that speech between a private citizen and a foreign government may still qualify as free speech and be protected in that regard.  Text  1 Stat. 613, January 30, 1799, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 953 (2004).  Constitutional authority for foreign relations  Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution includes the 'Treaty Clause,' which empowers the President of the United States to propose and chiefly negotiate agreements, which must be confirmed by the Senate, between the United States and other countries, which become treaties between the United States and other countries after the advice and consent of a supermajority of the United States Senate. In United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304 (1936), Justice Sutherland, writing for the Court, observed,  Accusations of violations  In general, the Act is intended to prevent unauthorized American citizens from interfering in disputes or controversies between the United States and foreign governments. Although attempts have been made to repeal the Act, it remains law and at least a potential sanction to be used against anyone who without authority interferes in the foreign relations of the United States. The US government has threatened to use the Act to stop Americans from negotiating with foreign governments. For example, in February 1941 Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles told the press that former President Herbert Hoover might be a target for prosecution because of his negotiations with European nations over sending food relief.George H. Nash, ed. Freedom Betrayed (2011) p xlix =19th century= Only two indictments have ever been handed down under the Logan Act. The first occurred in 1803 when a grand jury indicted Francis Flournoy, a Kentucky farmer, who had written an article in the Frankfort Guardian of Freedom under the pen name of \\"A Western American.\\" In the article, Flournoy advocated a separate nation in the western part of the United States that would ally with France. The United States Attorney for Kentucky, an Adams appointee and brother-in-law of Chief Justice John Marshall, went no further than procuring the indictment of Flournoy, and there was no further prosecution of the Kentucky farmer. The purchase of the Louisiana Territory later that year appeared to cause the separatism issue to become moot, and the case was abandoned. In 1852, Jonas Phillips Levy became the second and, to date the last, person to be indicted under the Logan Act. Levy, an American merchant and sailor who was living in Mexico at the time, had acquired a grant to build a railway across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the narrowest point across Mexico. Secretary of State Daniel Webster had been pressuring Mexico to accept a treaty that would allow a different group of American businessmen to build the railway. Levy wrote a letter to Mexican President Mariano Arista urging him to reject Webster's proposed treaty, prompting Webster to seek an indictment against Levy for violating the Logan Act. Federal prosecutors were forced to dismiss the case after Arista refused to hand over the original copy of the letter, depriving them of the evidence they needed to convict Levy. =20th century= In 1975, Senators John Sparkman and George McGovern were accused of violating the Logan Act when they traveled to Cuba and met with officials there. In considering that case, the U.S. Department of State concluded: In 1984, President Ronald Reagan stated that the activities of the Reverend Jesse Jackson, who had traveled to Cuba and Nicaragua that year and had returned with several Cuban political prisoners seeking asylum in the United States, may have violated the Logan Act, but Jackson was never indicted. In 1987 and 1988, President Reagan was furious at what he felt to be House Speaker Jim Wright's \\"intrusion\\" into the negotiations between Nicaragua's Sandinista government and the Contras for a cease-fire in the long civil war. The National Security Council considered using the Logan Act to muzzle Wright, but nothing ever came of it. =21st century= In June 2007, Representative Steve King introduced legislation that would prohibit Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi from drawing on federal funds to travel to foreign states which the U.S. deemed to sponsor terrorism. King claimed that Pelosi's dialogue with the Syrian government violated the Logan Act. The amendment was not adopted. In March 2015, 47 Republican senators released an open letter to the Iranian government regarding President Barack Obama's attempts to broker a nuclear arms agreement between Iran and six major powers (P5+1). The letter warns Iran of the limitations of President Obama's term in office and constitutional powers and notes that anything done without the advice and consent of the Senate could be undone by the next President. This prompted some commentators to suggest that the letter may have violated the Logan Act. A petition on the White House's We The People website requesting that the Obama administration prosecute the 47 senators under the Logan Act accumulated signatures from over 320,200 people. In July 2016, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack accused Donald Trump of encouraging the Russian government to hack the email of Hillary Clinton, Trump's opponent in the 2016 presidential election. Several Democratic Senators claimed Trump's comments appeared to violate the Logan Act. Laurence Tribe, a former Obama mentor and professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School, also commented on the incident saying, \\"Trump's 'jokes' inviting an adversary to wage cyberwar against the U.S. appear to violate the Logan Act and might even constitute treason.\\" In an opinion piece from December 2017, University of Chicago Law School professors Daniel Hemel and Eric Posner argued that Michael Flynn violated the Logan Act in his dealings with the Russian ambassador during the Presidential transition of Donald Trump, while the statements made by Flynn, \\"further reveal that a 'very senior member' of the Trump transition team almost certainly violated the Logan Act, too.\\" In April 2018, former Secretary of State John Kerry met with the Iranian Foreign Minister in order to ensure the Iran nuclear deal framework remained more or less intact. Matthew Summers, a spokesman for Kerry, admitted that Kerry \\"urged Iran to keep its commitments under the Iran nuclear agreement\\". The Boston Globe speculated that Kerry's actions could be interpreted as violating the Logan Act; however, Stephen Vladeck, law professor at the University of Texas, did not agree that Kerry would be in violation of the act as his intent was to preserve the US policy then in place, rather than seeking to destroy it. Vladick has also said of the Act: \\"It raises serious constitutional questions that I think would dissuade even the most zealous prosecutor from trying a case under the Logan Act.” President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has been accused of potentially violating the Logan Act for his role in the Trump–Ukraine scandal and other foreign business.  Constitutionality  There has been little judicial discussion of the constitutionality of the Logan Act. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in Waldron v. British Petroleum Co., 231 F. Supp. 72 (S.D.N.Y. 1964), mentioned in passing that the Act was likely unconstitutional due to the vagueness of the terms \\"defeat\\" and \\"measures,\\" but did not rule on the question. In 2006, the United States House Committee on Ethics warned departing members of the terms of the Act in an official Memorandum. The Committee commented in the Memorandum that the Act, \\"... has never been the basis of a prosecution, and this Committee has publicly questioned its constitutionality ... Members should be aware, however, that the law remains on the books.\\"  Proposed revisions  The chair of the House Judiciary Committee in the 109th Congress, F. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, proposed a comprehensive revision and modernization of the federal criminal code in 2006. The Logan Act would have been significantly revamped in the proposed legislation to prohibit only knowingly false statements made under oath. The section revising the Logan Act was proposed to read as follows: The bill, H.R. 6253, was not enacted into law.

Intended for release in 1981, the 2700 was one of several planned follow-ups to the 2600, but the system was never put into full production. While It is unclear how many of these systems exist, former Atari employee Dan Kramer has stated that at least 12 consoles were made (one is owned by The National Videogame Museum), plus extra controllers. The 2700 was fully compatible with the Atari 2600 system and intended to use that system's games and accessories. The 2700's new features over the 2600 included wireless controllers featuring a combination of a joystick and paddle, touch sensitive switches, and a streamlined wedge–shaped case. Internally, the product was also called the \\"RC Stella\\", where \\"RC\\" referred to Radio Control and \\"Stella\\" was the internal Atari codename for the 2600. FeaturesControllers= The 2700 wireless controllers operate via radio signals. They feature an on/off switch and are powered by a replaceable 9-volt battery. Communication with the console is achieved via a flexible antenna. Each controller is designated as either a left (player 1) or right (player 2) and cannot be swapped.2700 at the Atari History Museum website Each 2700 controller features a single fire button and a short stick which combines the features of a standard 8 position joystick and a 270 degree paddle controller.Patent image of 2700 controller Game Select and Reset buttons appear on both the controllers and the console, the latter presumably for instances where standard wired controllers would be used instead of the wireless units. =Console= The console features two standard Atari 9-pin controller ports on its right side, allowing for use of other 2600 compatible controllers such as Atari-made and third-party joysticks, as well as Atari's own Driving Controller, Paddles, Kid's Controller, Keypad Controller, and Trak-Ball. The top surface features a 2600 style cartridge slot and touch-sensitive buttons with associated red LEDs, including buttons for functions directly related to the wireless controllers, such as selecting between the wireless controllers and any plugged in, and for switching the function of the wireless controllers between joystick and paddle mode. The case represented a significant departure from previous Atari consumer product designs, dispensing with aesthetics of earlier Atari consoles. Faux wood grain inlays and mechanical throw switches were replaced by a sleek, dark brown wedge with indented. touch sensitive switches. The casing featured a hinge- topped storage bay for the wireless controllers and a built-in belly groove for winding excess cable to connect to a TV. Cancellation Although they were the primary innovation of the 2700, it was the wireless controllers that actually caused the console to be cancelled prior to release. Specifically, the wireless controllers had a working radius of approximately 1000 ft, but there was no mechanism for pairing a given set of controllers with a specific console, which meant controllers for any one 2700 could unintentionally affect other nearby 2700s. Furthermore, the controllers were based on the design of garage door openers, which led to concerns that they could accidentally trigger other remote controlled devices. Legacy Although abandoned, the 2700 case design became the model for a number of later Atari game systems, notably the very similar looking Atari 2800Atari 2800 on Atari Museum for Japan and the similar Atari-made Sears-branded Video Arcade II, both of which featured (wired) controllers which combined the functions of joystick and paddle. The case design also influenced a whole range of subsequent Atari home consoles, including the Atari 5200 (which featured a 2700-like controller bay), as well as the Atari 2600 Jr., and Atari 7800. The idea of wireless controllers for the 2600 and joystick compatible systems was in 1983 fulfilled by the Atari 2600 Wireless Remote Controlled Joystick, a plug-in accessory (Model No., CX 42).\\"The Atari 2600 Remote Controlled Joystick\\". Atari History Museum. However, to house additional electronics to correct the interference problem, the controllers were bulky. Additionally, they were difficult to control and suffered from poor battery life. The 2012-released Atari Flashback 4 also featured wireless controllers based on infrared technology.

The genre in itself has been defined by surfers, traveling with their friends and documenting the experience on film. In the 'heyday' of Bruce Brown, Greg Noll, Bud Brown, John Severson, films were projected for rambunctious fans in music halls, civic centers and high school auditoriums. During the 1980s, the market for surf films surged with the release of more affordable video cameras. By the 1990s, the surfing market became saturated with low and medium budget surf films, many with sound tracks that reflected the mass media driven music culture. VHS and eventually DVDs made the surf film viewing experience an \\"at home\\" affair and the 'heyday' of joining your friends or taking a girl to \\"surf movie night\\" at the local high school soon quickly vanished. Furthermore, large surf brands began making surf films under their marketing budgets to promote clothing and product sales. Titles like Sonny Miller's, \\"The Search\\" for Rip Curl redefined the genre with exotic locales, big budgets and name surfers, such as Tom Curren. In the late 1990s to the present, there has been a revival of the \\"independent surf film.\\" Artists, like The Malloys, Jack Johnson and Jason Baffa have reinvented the genre by shooting self- financed 16mm motion picture film and utilizing indy music bands like G. Love, Alexi Murdoch, Mojave 3, White Buffalo and Donavon Frankenreiter, creating what the surf media has called, \\"modern classics.\\" Some places still screen surfing films on the big screen.

The cave is situated at an altitude of , about from Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir and reached through Pahalgam town. The shrine forms an important part of Hinduism, and is considered to be one of the holiest shrines in Hinduism. The cave is surrounded by snowy mountains. The cave itself is covered with snow most of the year except for a short period of time in summer when it is open for pilgrims. Hundreds of thousands of Hindu and other devotees make an annual pilgrimage to the Amarnath cave across challenging mountainous terrain. The Amarnath temple is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas, temples throughout South Asia that commemorate the location of fallen body parts of the Hindu deity Sati. The ShivLinga Ice Lingam at Amarnath Cave Inside the high Amarnath cave, a stalagmite is formed due to freezing of water drops that fall from the roof of the cave on to the floor and grows up vertically from the cave floor. It is considered to be a Shiva Linga by Hindus. It is mentioned in the ancient Hindu texts of Mahabharata and Puranas that Lingam represents Lord Shiva. The Lingam waxes during May to August, as snow melts in the Himalayas above the cave and the resultant water seeps into the rocks that form the cave and gradually wanes thereafter. As per religious beliefs, it is said that the lingam grows and shrinks with the phases of the moon reaching its height during the summer festival, although there is no scientific evidence for this belief.Ortner, Jon, \\"On the road again\\" . PDN Gallery. According to a Hindu religious beliefs, this is the place where Shiva explained the secret of life and eternity to his divine consort, Parvati.Shantha N. Nair, \\"The Holy Himalayas\\", pp.84. History The book Rajatarangini (Book VII v.183) refers to Amareshwara or Amarnath. It is believed that Queen Suryamati in the 11th century AD gifted trishuls, banalingas and other sacred emblems to this temple. Rajavalipataka, begun by Prjayabhatta has detailed references to the pilgrimage to Amarnath Cave. Other than this, there are further references to this pilgrimage in many other ancient texts. =Discovery of Holy Cave= According to legend, Bhrigu Muni was the first to have discovered Amarnath. Long time ago it is believed that The Valley of Kashmir was submerged under water and Kashyap Muni drained it through a series of rivers and rivulets. Therefore, when the waters drained, Bhrigu Muni was the first to have Darshan of Lord Amarnath. Thereafter, when people heard of the Lingam, it became an abode of Lord Bholenath for all believers and a pilgrimage which is done by lakhs of people each year. According to the researchers and as per the belief of locals gadaria community were the first to discover the Amaranth cave and saw the first glimpse of Baba Barfani. François Bernier, a French physician accompanied Emperor Aurangzeb during his visit to Kashmir in 1663. In his book \\"Travels in Mughal Empire\\" he writes while giving an account the places he visited in Kashmir that he was \\"pursuing journey to a grotto full of wonderful congelations, two days journey from Sangsafed\\" when he \\"received intelligence that my Nawab felt very impatient and uneasy on account of my long absence\\". The \\"grotto\\" he refers to is obviously the Amarnath cave as the editor of the second edition of the English translation of the book, Vincient A. Smith makes clear in his introduction. He writes: \\"The grotto full of wonderful congelations is the Amarnath cave, where blocks of ice, stalagmites formed by dripping water from the roof are worshipped by many Hindus who resort here as images of Shiva…..\\" Yatra Amarnath Yatra Camp. View of Amarnath Valley. The peak pilgrimage occurs when the iced stalagmite Shiv lingam reaches the apex of its waxing phase through the summer months.

The Amarnath pilgrimage was suspended in July 2016 due to the Kashmir unrest. A section of Sufis and Shias later demanded resumption of the Yatra. Kalbe Jawad, a Shia cleric and general secretary of Majlis-e- Ulama-e-Hind and Sufi Cleric Syed Hasnain Baqai expressed concern that the tradition had been suspended because of upheaval in Kashmir.\\"Muslim group asks for reviving Amarnath Yatra\\" , Times of India, 17 July 2016.

This popular yatra destination for Hindus, received about 634,000 people in 2011, the highest recorded number for the site. The number was 622,000 in 2012 and 350,000 in 2013. Pilgrims visit the holy site during the 45-day season around the festival of Shravani Mela in July–August, coinciding with the Hindu holy month of Shraavana. The beginning of the annual pilgrimage, called Amarnath Yatra\\"Amarnath yatra likely to start from 29 June\\" , Rediff, 19 June 2011 is marked by 'pratham pujan' to invoke the blessings of Shri Amarnathji.\\"Amarnath yatra's pratham pujan held near Pahalgam\\" , 15 June 2011 23:04 IST, rediff.com In olden days the route was via Rawalpindi (Pakistan) but now a direct train is there connecting rest of India to Jammu, the winter capital of the State. The best part of journey is between Guru Purnima and Shravan Purnima. But the highly unpredictable weather of the mountains should be more obliging before Guru Purnima as rains would not start. There is a bus service from Jammu to Pahalgam (7,500 ft.). At Pahalgam the pilgrims arrange for coolies or ponies to carry gear of food and clothes etc. Pahalgam in Kashmiri means the land of shepherds. In 2019, the Yatra would commence on 1 July and end on 15 August. =Route= Amarnath pilgrims en route the holy shrine Devotees travel on foot, either from Srinagar or from Pahalgam. The journey from Pahalgam takes about five days. The State Road Transport Corporation and Private Transport Operators provide the regular services from Jammu to Pahalgam and Baltal. Also privately hired taxis are available from Jammu & Kashmir. The shorter northern route is just about 16 km long, but has a very steep gradient and is quite difficult to climb. It starts from Baltal and passes through Domel, Barari, and Sangam to reach the cave. The northern route is along the Amarnath valley and all along the route one can see the river Amaravati (a tributary of Chenab) which originates from Amarnath Glacier. It is believed that Lord Shiva left Nandi, the bull, at Pahalgam (Bail Gaon). At Chandanwari, he released the Moon from his hair (Jata). On the banks of Lake Sheshnag, he released his snakes. At Mahagunas Parvat (Mahaganesh Mountain), he left his son Lord Ganesha. At Panjtarni, Lord Shiva left behind the five elements - Earth, Water, Air, Fire and Sky. As a symbol of sacrificing the earthly world, Lord Shiva performed the Tandava Dance. Then, finally, Lord Shiva entered the Holy Amarnath Cave along with Mata Parvati. =Facilities= En route the cave, various non-governmental organisations have set up food supply and resting tents called pandals which are available for free to the pilgrims. Near the shrine, hundreds of tents which are erected by locals can be hired for a night's stay. Helicopter services from base camp to Panjtarni (6 km from the cave) are also available from various private operators. Security Every year, thousands of central armed forces and state police personnel are deployed to provide security to pilgrims from potential terror threats. The forces position at various halts and also in the perimeter of the shrine. =Deaths= Of the 622,000 yatra pilgrims in 2012, 130 died during the yatra. The major cause was attributed to people who were not physically fit for the arduous climb, high elevations, and adverse weather undertook the yatra. Some also died in road accidents before reaching the base camp from where the yatra starts. Of the 130 deaths, 88 were due to purported health reasons and 42 in road accidents. The 2012 pilgrimage ended on Shravana Purnima (Raksha Bandan) Day, 2 August 2012. =Organisers= Officially, the Yatra is organised by the government in collaboration with the Shree Amarnath Shrine Board (SASB). Various agencies provide necessary facilities all along the route during the Yatra period, which includes provision of ponies, supply of power, telecommunication facilities, firewood and setting up of fair price shops. =1990s terrorist threats and 1996 yatra tragedy = The number of pilgrims in 1992 reached 50,000. The first attack against the pilgrims happened in 1993, that year Pakistan-based Harkat-ul-Ansar had announced a ban due to demolition of Babri Masjid. The pilgrimage however passed off mostly peacefully. In 1994-5 and 1998, the group again announced a ban on the annual Amarnath yatra. In 1996 the militants had assured that they would not interfere allowing a resumed yatra with far greater numbers than in previous years. However, unseasonal blizzards in late August of that year led to a tragedy that claimed the lives of 242 yatris, killed by exhaustion and exposure. =2000 pilgrimage massacre= The pilgrimage suffered another setback with the massacre at Nunwan base camp in Pahalgam of at 32 people (including 21 unarmed Hindu pilgrims, 7 unarmed Muslim civilians and 3 security force officers) in a two hour long indiscriminate shoot out by Kashmiri separatists on 2 August 2000.Amarnath pilgrimage resumes , BBC, 2000-08-04 Most were yatris on their way to AmarnathNight of massacres leaves 105 dead in valley , The Tribune, 2000-08-03 or porters and horsemen who would have ferried the pilgrims to the site.Muslim militants kill 21 Hindu pilgrims in Kashmir , The Independent, 2000-08-02 This attack on Amarnath yatra was part of the larger 1st and 2nd August 2000 Kashmir massacre in 5 separate coordinated terrorist attacks that killed at least 89 (official count) to 105 people (as reported by PTI), and injured at least 62 more.\\"Night of massacres leaves 105 dead in valley\\" , The Tribune, 3 August 2000. Then Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee blamed Lashkar-e-Taiba for the killings. =2001 massacre = On 20 July 2001, a terrorist threw a grenade on a pilgrim night camp at Sheshnag near the Amarnath shrine in which at least 13 persons, including 3 women, were killed in two explosions and firing by militants, 2 were security officials and 3 of the killed person were Muslim civilians. 15 other were also injured in the attack.\\"Amarnath Yatra devotees have faced repeated terror attacks: Here's the blood-soaked history of pilgrimage\\" , First Post, 11 July 2017. =2002 massacre = On 30 July and 6 August 2002, in two separate incidents terrorists from al-Mansuriyan, a front group of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, massacred 2 and 9 pilgrims and injured 3 and 27 people in Srinagar and near Nunwan pilgrimage base camp respectively.2003, Chronology of Major Killings in Jammu and Kashmir , Kashmir herald , Volume 2, No. 11.] =2017 yatra attack = Seven Hindu pilgrims were killed on 10 July in a gun attack returning from Amarnath. The Pakistani outfit, the Lashkar-e-Taiba, was found responsible. =2019 suspension= The yatra was suspended in August 2019 after the state government stated there was a threat of possible terrorist attacks. Similarly, the pilgrimage to Machail Mata was suspended. However, it was also speculated that the Yatra suspension might have been linked to the revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. =2020 coronavirus pandemic= On 22 April 2020, the Shri Amarnath Ji Shrine Board announced the suspension of the Yatra because of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Later however it withdrew the press circular and announced cancellation of the suspension. Lieutenant Governor G. C. Murmu said that a final decision will be dependent on any future developments relating to the pandemic. In light of the pandemic, union territory government on 4 July announced that only 500 people will be permitted road travel to the shrine and everyone coming into the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir from outside will be tested for COVID-19, being quarantined until their reports come out to be negative. The pilgrimage was later cancelled on 21 July by the Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board due to the pandemic, with cases of coronavirus in the union territory increasing greatly since 1 July. Controversies2008 Land transfer controversy= On 26 May 2008, the Government of India and the state government of Jammu and Kashmir reached an agreement to transfer of forest land to the Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) to set up temporary shelters and facilities for Hindu pilgrims. Kashmiri separatists opposed the move citing reasons that it will jeopardize the article 370 that gives separate identity to the people of Jammu and Kashmir and prevents any Indian citizen to settle in Kashmir. People in Kashmir staged widespread protests against this decision by government of India. Due to the protests, the J&K; State government relented and reversed the decision to transfer land. As a result, Hindus in the Jammu region launched counter-agitations against this roll back. =Environmental impact= Environmentalists have expressed concern that the number of people participating in the Amarnath Yatra is having a negative impact on the area's ecology and some have expressed support for government regulated limits on the number of pilgrims permitted to make the trek. However no studies have been made nor has an environmental impact assessment done. As of date, the Government of India restricts travellers only on the basis on logistics, time window for the yatra and weather. =Amarnath yatra tax controversy= The Government of Jammu and Kashmir had in 2010 issued a notification under the State Motor Vehicle Taxation Act 1957, under which vehicles going to Amarnath Yatra will have to pay a tax of 2,000 for seven days and 2,000 per day after that. Similar provisions were made for pilgrims going to Sri Mata Vaishno Devi under which they need to pay 2000 for a period of three days. India's central political party the Bhartiya Janata Party expressed its ire over imposition of entry fee and accused the then UPA led central government to direct the Jammu and Kashmir dispensation to desist from making attempts to \\"discriminate\\" between followers of various religions. BJP criticized the decision \\"as a reminiscent of Jizya imposed during Mughal period on Hindus,\\" In response to the question in Lok Sabha (Lower house of the Indian Parliament) then Minister of State for Finance, S.S. Palanimanickam clarified that tax is levied on all India Tourist Vehicles entering the state and is therefore not correct to say that Government of Jammu & Kashmir is levying any additional tax on vehicles going to Amarnath and Vaishno Devi. He also said that Taxation of Motor vehicles falls under the purview of State Governments as per the seventh schedule of Constitution of India and Central Government cannot direct the State Government to change the tax rate on vehicles.BJP demands removal of fee imposed on Amarnath yatris , Times of India.

He was the son of D. V. Gundappa, an Indian philosopher and writer in the Kannada language. Early life and career Swamy was born in 1918 to D. V. Gundappa and Bhagirathamma. He studied at Central College in Bangalore and obtained his bachelor's degree in botany. After this, and at the suggestion of his father, he began to study the embryology of orchids at home after obtaining a second-hand microscope, a microtome and some basic laboratory tools. He received a PhD from the University of Mysore in 1947 and had a brief post-doctoral period at Harvard University under Irving Widmer Bailey. From 1953, he served as a professor of botany (and later the principal) at Presidency College, Chennai. He briefly served as a visiting professor of the botany department at the University of Mysuru during 1979-80. Notably, D. V. Gundappa and B. G. L. Swamy became the first father-son duo to win the Sahitya Akademi Award. While conferring the award to Dr. Swamy, the then-president of Sahitya Akademi, Umashankar Joshi, described him as \\"the famous son of a famous father\\". B. P. Radhakrishna has authored a book about the life and achievements of Dr. Swamy. Research Swamy's primary research area was plant anatomy, particularly the structure of connections between plants' roots and stems. He discovered several plant species, including Ascarina maheshwarii and Sarcandra irvingbaileyi, which he named after two of his teachers. In 1976, he was awarded the Birbal Sahni gold medal by the Government of India for his work in botany. Writings Swamy's literary works encompass a wide range of topics. Many of them are related to botany and introduce botanical concepts to the layperson. A few of his books cover plants used in everyday life in a scientific manner, such as (South America in Our Stomach). Other works by Swamy pertain to literature, and some of them are partially autobiographical, dealing with his experiences as a professor and principal. Apart from being an acclaimed botanist, B. G. L. Swamy was widely respected in the history and literary circles. He extensively studied and researched the histories and literature of the Kannada and Tamil Languages. His book (Among the Tamil Heads) is devoted to examining theories pertaining to the language's origins (examining the claims that were being made in those days by the Dravidian parties) and mostly debunking them. In this book, he debunks some of the theories put forward by Tamil linguists and historians such as Iravatham Mahadevan and Nilkanta Shastri. He raised questions regarding gaping holes and contradictions he discovered in their theories. According to N. K. Ramasheshan, Dr. Swamy authored more than 300 research articles in English, Spanish, German, Latin and French that were published in well-known papers of international repute.  His book (Green Gold) won him the Kendra Sahitya Academy award given by the Government of India in 1978. With that, Gundappa and Swamy became the first father and son duo to win this prestigious award. is a treatise on some familiar and unfamiliar botanical species. It is also a travelogue enlivened by human drama and humor. Students of advanced botany undertake scientific tours in the company of their teachers for the identification and collection of botanical specimens. Swamy was a gifted man of letters with an observant eye, a sense of humour and, at the same time, a deep interest in history and the fine arts such as music, painting and architecture. Thus, as an artist and a scientist, he could explore and explain the world of botany in the light of a wider understanding. He describes the externals of a specimen with vivid precision and technical detail, but his account of the genus and species is only a prelude to a livelier, non-technical account of its appearance, its locations and its practical uses. Sometimes the reader discovers how the specimen claimed attention by appearing in well-known literary works of antiquity. The book thus unfolds before the reader the abundant riches and the endless variety of the botanical world, as well as the hundreds of ways it helps humans. The human variety and the different characters, all memorably visualized, provide ample scope for portraying dramatic situations of all kinds, from the comic to the romantic. The book primarily deals with the world of plants but it deals also with the world of humans. is as informative as it is delightful. =Books= * () * () * () * () * () * () * () * () * () (incomplete) * () * () * () * () * () (incomplete) * () (translation from Kannada by U.

Hōzōin-ryū was founded by Hōzōin Kakuzenbō In'ei (宝蔵院 覚禅房 胤栄, 1521-1607) in c. 1560. In'ei was a Buddhist monk of Kōfuku- ji Temple in Nara, Japan. He adored martial arts and trained in the art of swordsmanship. At the same time, he was coached and mentored by , a master of the spear. Under this master's guidance, In'ei honed his spearmanship. It is said that one evening, on seeing the reflection of the crescent moon shining on Sarusawa pond, he was inspired to create a spear with a cross-shaped spearhead. He imagined this style of spear would be more effective in fighting. With this new type of spear (known as ), he founded the Hōzōin-ryū.

These installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community, or are sometimes connected to electric power networks, particularly where net metering is offered. There are many of these installations around the world, particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without the purchase of fuel. Micro hydro systems complement solar PV power systems because in many areas, water flow, and thus available hydro power, is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum. Micro hydro is frequently accomplished with a pelton wheel for high head, low flow water supply. The installation is often just a small dammed pool, at the top of a waterfall, with several hundred feet of pipe leading to a small generator housing. In low head sites, generally water wheels and Archimedes screws are used. Construction Typical microhydro setup. Construction details of a microhydro plant are site-specific. Sometimes an existing mill-pond or other artificial reservoir is available and can be adapted for power production. In general, microhydro systems are made up of a number of components. The most important include the intake where water is diverted from the natural stream, river, or perhaps a waterfall. An intake structure such as a catch box is required to screen out floating debris and fish, using a screen or array of bars to keep out large objects. In temperate climates, this structure must resist ice as well. The intake may have a gate to allow the system to be dewatered for inspection and maintenance. The intake is then brought through a canal and then forebay. The forebay is used for sediment holding. At the bottom of the system the water is tunneled through a pipeline (penstock) to the powerhouse building containing a turbine. The penstock builds up pressure from the water that has traveled downwards. In mountainous areas, access to the route of the penstock may provide considerable challenges. If the water source and turbine are far apart, the construction of the penstock may be the largest part of the costs of construction. At the turbine, a controlling valve is installed to regulate the flow and the speed of the turbine. The turbine converts the flow and pressure of the water to mechanical energy; the water emerging from the turbine returns to the natural watercourse along a tailrace channel. The turbine turns a generator, which is then connected to electrical loads; this might be directly connected to the power system of a single building in very small installations, or may be connected to a community distribution system for several homes or buildings. Usually, microhydro installations do not have a dam and reservoir, like large hydroelectric plants have, relying on a minimal flow of water to be available year-round. Head and flow characteristics Microhydro systems are typically set up in areas capable of producing up to 100 kilowatts of electricity. This can be enough to power a home or small business facility. This production range is calculated in terms of \\"head\\" and \\"flow\\". The higher each of these are, the more power available. Hydraulic head is the pressure measurement of water falling in a pipe expressed as a function of the vertical distance the water falls. This change in elevation is usually measured in feet or meters. A drop of at least 2 feet is required or the system may not be feasible. When quantifying head, both gross and net head must be considered. Gross head approximates power accessibility through the vertical distance measurement alone whereas net head subtracts pressure lost due to friction in piping from the gross head. \\"Flow\\" is the actual quantity of water falling from a site and is usually measured in gallons per minute, cubic feet per second, or liters per second. Low flow/high head installations in steep terrain have significant pipe costs. A long penstock starts with low pressure pipe at the top and progressively higher pressure pipe closer to the turbine in order to reduce pipe costs. The available power, in kilowatts, from such a system can be calculated by the equation P=Q*H/k, where Q is the flow rate in gallons per minute, H is the static head, and k is a constant of 5,310 gal*ft/min*kW. For instance, for a system with a flow of 500 gallons per minute and a static head of 60 feet, the theoretical maximum power output is 5.65 kW. The system is prevented from 100% efficiency (from obtaining all 5.65 kW) due to the real world, such as: turbine efficiency, friction in pipe, and conversion from potential to kinetic energy. Turbine efficiency is generally between 50-80%, and pipe friction is accounted for using the Hazen–Williams equation. Regulation and operation Typically, an automatic controller operates the turbine inlet valve to maintain constant speed (and frequency) when the load changes on the generator. In a system connected to a grid with multiple sources, the turbine control ensures that power always flows out from the generator to the system. The frequency of the alternating current generated needs to match the local standard utility frequency. In some systems, if the useful load on the generator is not high enough, a load bank may be automatically connected to the generator to dissipate energy not required by the load; while this wastes energy, it may be required if it's not possible to control the water flow through the turbine. An induction generator always operates at the grid frequency irrespective of its rotation speed; all that is necessary is to ensure that it is driven by the turbine faster than the synchronous speed so that it generates power rather than consuming it. Other types of generator can use a speed control systems for frequency matching. With the availability of modern power electronics it is often easier to operate the generator at an arbitrary frequency and feed its output through an inverter which produces output at grid frequency. Power electronics now allow the use of permanent magnet alternators that produce wild AC to be stabilised. This approach allows low speed / low head water turbines to be competitive; they can run at the best speed for extraction of energy, and the power frequency is controlled by the electronics instead of the generator. Very small installations (pico hydro), a few kilowatts or smaller, may generate direct current and charge batteries for peak use times. Turbine types Several types of water turbines can be used in micro hydro installations, selection depending on the head of water, the volume of flow, and such factors as availability of local maintenance and transport of equipment to the site. For hilly regions where a waterfall of 50 meters or more may be available, a Pelton wheel can be used. For low head installations, Francis or propeller-type turbines are used. Very low head installations of only a few meters may use propeller-type turbines in a pit, or water wheels and Archimedes screws. Small micro hydro installations may successfully use industrial centrifugal pumps, run in reverse as prime movers; while the efficiency may not be as high as a purpose-built runner, the relatively low cost makes the projects economically feasible. In low-head installations, maintenance and mechanism costs can be relatively high. A low- head system moves larger amounts of water, and is more likely to encounter surface debris. For this reason a Banki turbine also called Ossberger turbine, a pressurized self-cleaning crossflow waterwheel, is often preferred for low- head micro hydro systems. Though less efficient, its simpler structure is less expensive than other low-head turbines of the same capacity. Since the water flows in, then out of it, it cleans itself and is less prone to jam with debris. *Screw turbine (Reverse Archimedes' screw): two low-head schemes in England, Settle Hydro and Torrs Hydro use an Archimedes' screw which is another debris-tolerant design. Efficiency 85%. *Gorlov: the Gorlov helical turbine free stream or constrained flow with or without a dam,Gorlov A.M., Development of the helical reaction hydraulic turbine. Final Technical Report, The US Department of Energy, August 1998, The Department of Energy's (DOE) Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information. *Francis and propeller turbines. *Kaplan turbine : Is a high flow, low head, propeller-type turbine. An alternative to the traditional kaplan turbine is a large diameter, slow turning, permanent magnet, sloped open flow VLH turbine with efficiencies of 90%. *Water wheel : advanced hydraulic water wheels and hydraulic wheel- part reaction turbine can have hydraulic efficiencies of 67% and 85% respectively. Overshot water wheel maximum efficiency (hydraulic efficiency) is 85%. Undershot water wheels can operate with very low head, but also have efficiencies below 30%. *Gravitation water vortex power plant : part of the river flow at a weir or natural water fall is diverted into a round basin with a central bottom exit that creates a vortex. A simple rotor (and connected generator) is moved by the kinetic energy. Efficiencies of 83% down to 64% at 1/3 part flow. Use Microhydro systems are very flexible and can be deployed in a number of different environments. They are dependent on how much water flow the source (creek, river, stream) has and the velocity of the flow of water. Energy can be stored in battery banks at sites that are far from a facility or used in addition to a system that is directly connected so that in times of high demand there is additional reserve energy available. These systems can be designed to minimize community and environmental impact regularly caused by large dams or other mass hydroelectric generation sites. =Potential for rural development= In relation to rural development, the simplicity and low relative cost of micro hydro systems open up new opportunities for some isolated communities in need of electricity. With only a small stream needed, remote areas can access lighting and communications for homes, medical clinics, schools, and other facilities. Microhydro can even run a certain level of machinery supporting small businesses. Regions along the Andes mountains and in Sri Lanka and China already have similar, active programs. One seemingly unexpected use of such systems in some areas is to keep young community members from moving into more urban regions in order to spur economic growth. Also, as the possibility of financial incentives for less carbon intensive processes grows, the future of microhydro systems may become more appealing. Micro-hydro installations can also provide multiple uses. For instance, micro-hydro projects in rural Asia have incorporated agro- processing facilities such as rice mills alongside standard electrification into the project design. Cost The cost of a micro hydro plant can be between 1,000 and 5000 U.S. dollars per kW installed Advantages and disadvantagesAdvantages= Microhydro power is generated through a process that utilizes the natural flow of water. This power is most commonly converted into electricity. With no direct emissions resulting from this conversion process, there are little to no harmful effects on the environment, if planned well, thus supplying power from a renewable source and in a sustainable manner. Microhydro is considered a \\"run-of-river\\" system meaning that water diverted from the stream or river is redirected back into the same watercourse. Adding to the potential economic benefits of microhydro is efficiency, reliability, and cost effectiveness. =Disadvantages= Microhydro systems are limited mainly by characteristics of the site. The most direct limitation comes from small sources with minuscule flow. Likewise, flow can fluctuate seasonally in some areas. Lastly, though perhaps the foremost disadvantage is the distance from the power source to the site in need of energy. This distributional issue as well as the others are key when considering using a microhydro system.

Different styles of Yagyū Shingan-ryū, such as Heihojutsu and Taijutsu, assert different founders, Takenaga Hayato and Araki Mataemon respectively, but they all go back to Ushū Tatewaki (羽州 帯刀), referred to in some historical scrolls as Shindō Tatewaki, who taught a system based on Sengoku-period battlefield tactics, that was called Shindō-ryū. The word is rooted in Zen philosophy, and was chosen to describe a fundamental concept of the style. Shingan means \\"mind’s eye,\\" or \\"heart's eye,\\" and refers to the ability to sense or read an opponent's intentions via an inner sense.Skoss, Diane (Editor). 1997. Koryū Bujutsu.Classical Warrior Traditions of Japan, volume 1, p85 #1. New Jersey, Koryū Books. Originally called simply Shingan-ryū, it was later renamed Yagyū Shingan-ryū, due to the influence of Yagyu Tajima no Kami Munenori's Yagyū Shinkage-ryū.Mol, Serge (2001) Classical Fighting Arts of Japan: a complete guide to koryu jujutsu Kodansha International, Tokyo, , pp.176-178 Yagyū Shingan-ryū was created to be a battlefield art with a large comprehensive curriculum of weapons, and grappling techniques for use both while armored and unarmored. The techniques of Yagyū Shingan-ryū were designed to eliminate an enemy quickly and effortlessly. In the early days, both the Yagyū Shingan and Shinkage schools were similar, as both consisted of an array of armed and unarmed combat techniques. However, as the two schools evolved, the Yagyū Shinkage-ryū focused primarily on swordsmanship (kenjutsu), whereas the Yagyū Shingan-ryū continued as a comprehensive combat system, training several arts, including jujutsu, quarterstaff fighting (bōjutsu), glaive fighting (naginatajutsu), sword drawing techniques (iaijutsu) and sword fighting (kenjutsu). Takenaga Hayato Takenaga Hayato (竹永 隼人, dates of birth and death unknown), sometimes known as Takenaga Hayato Kanetsugu (Jikinyu), founded the Yagyū Shingan-ryū, which he taught primarily in what is now known as Sendai, Miyagi. Before founding the Yagyu Shingan-ryū, Hayato studied Shindō-ryū (神道流), Shinkage-ryū - Divine Shadow (神影流), Shuza-ryū (首座流), Toda- ryū (戸田流) and Edo line (Yagyū) Shinkage-ryū - New Shadow (新陰流). Takenaga Hayato was clearly influenced by his studies of the Shindō-ryū of Ushū Tatewaki. Takenaga Hayato went to Edo, was employed by the Yagyū family and studied Edo line Yagyū Shinkage-ryū with Yagyū Munenori. The name Yagyū Shingan-ryū was used after Hayato was directed to use the family \\"Yagyū\\" name in his art Shingan-ryū by Yagyu Munenori. On return to his home in Sendai, Miyagi he taught the ashigaru until his death. Following Takenaga Hayato the tradition was passed on to Yoshikawa Ichiroemon, thence Ito Kyuzaburo, then to Koyama Samon who traveled to Edo and became the headmaster of the Edo line of Yagyu Shingan-ryū. Koyama Samon in later years returned to his home where he continued to instruct Yagyū Shingan-ryū. The Sendai Line of the Yagyu Shingan Ryu is under the guidance of Headmasters Shimazu Sensei (Soke 'Chikuosha') & Hoshi Sensei (Soke 'Ryushinkan'). Araki Mataemon Araki Mataemon (荒木 又右衛門, 1594-1634) is credited as the spiritual father of the Edo-line of Yagyū Shingan-ryū, later to become known as Yagyū Shingan-ryū Taijutsu. The Edo line stems from headmaster Koyama Samon (1718–1800), who carried the art from Sendai to Edo. While Araki's name appears on the Edo school's historical scrolls, his actual influence on the tradition is unclear. For many, he is considered the spiritual founder of the Yagyu Shingan Ryu Taijutsu tradition, but according to Edo era depictions of the skirmish that made him famous (by killing 37 ennemies with only 1 assistant), he fought it without wearing armor. Yagyū Shingan-ryū has evolved over the centuries, with each headmaster refining the art. Although there is no evidence, it is plausible that Koyama Samon may have been influenced or inspired by Araki. This may have led to the differences in appearance and philosophy that exist today from the influence of Hoshino Tenchi. Koyama Samon in later life returned to his home in Sendai. Araki Mataemon was a practitioner of Yagyū Shinkage-ryū, under his mentor Yagyū Munenori. Legend states that Munenori drew his sword and attacked Araki unexpectedly. Araki defended himself using nothing more than a rolled-up piece of paper. After passing this final test, he was awarded menkyo kaiden by his teacher, Munenori. It is also said that Araki was Yagyu Jubei's teacher. This is portrayed in the popular Japanese television series, \\"Three Generations of the Yagyū Sword.\\" Originally, Araki's Shingan-ryū was known as \\"Araki-dō.\\" The Edo-line legend states that it was Yagyū Jubei that granted permission for the use of the Yagyū name. Today, the Edo-line of Yagyū Shingan-ryū Taijutsu, under the guidance of headmaster Kajitsuka Sensei (Soke Arakido), practice the art of Yagyū Shinkage-ryū alongside Yagyū Shingan-ryū Taijutsu (Kajitsuka holds menkyo kaiden in Yagyū Shinkage-ryū). Branches There are two main lines of Yagyū Shingan-ryū, and a few offshoot lineages. =Sendai line= The Yagyu Shingan Ryu Heihojutsu (Sendai line) is directed by Headmaster Shimazu Kenji (Chikuosha). Shimazu Kenji has studied both the Edo and Sendai line under Headmaster Aizawa Tomio (Edo line - Yorifuji den and Sendai line - Kano den) and the Sendai line under Headmaster, Hoshi Kunio (Sendai line - Hoshi den). Kyodensho Chikuosha Northern Europe Official Webspace The Yagyū Shingan- ryū Heihōjutsu line under Shimazu Kenji is headquartered in Tokyo. Small but strong branches under the direct supervision of Shimazu Kenji exist in Australia (Philip Hinshelwood) and Sweden (Per Eriksson). The Yagyū Shingan- ryū Heihō (Sendai line) was headed by Hoshi Kunio (Ryushinkan) until his death in 2007. His grandson Hoshi Kunio II [born Hiroaki Kunio] was appointed as his successor; 18th generation headmaster [5th generation family descendant]. The Yagyū Shingan-ryū (Sendai line) has three primary levels within the curriculum, Omote, Ura and Kage. It has a broad focus (weaponry, jujutsu, and kappo) and has been practiced in Sendai area for several generations. =Edo line= Yagyū Shingan-ryū Taijutsu (Edo line) is directed by Kajitsuka Yasushi (11th Generation Headmaster). This lineage stems from Koyama Samon, 4th generation headmaster of main-line Yagyu Shingan-ryu Heiho. Koyama operated a dojo in the ancient capital of Edo (modern day Tokyo) for close to 20 years. The Tokugawa shogunate managed to bring stability to the nation, marking the end of a long period of inner conflict. The armored battlefield tactics naturally evolved into more practical self-defense methods relevant to the locale and social climate. The Taijutsu school was created by Hoshino Tenchi, 8th generation headmaster and is known for its close quarter jujutsu grappling techniques, which require a clear understanding of taijutsu (body movement). In this context, taijutsu refers to the underlying principles of body dynamics, rather than the physical techniques themselves. As the name jujutsu or yawara implies, they are essentially soft techniques and should not require a great deal of brute strength. The aggressiveness of the style remained the same. Some of the trade-mark maneuvers include pole-driving (dropping an opponent on his head), back breaking, and neck snapping. Although the Edo-line of Yagyu Shingan-ryu does not employ the wearing of armor during practice or exhibition, the techniques are clearly related to armored combat. The style includes the usual array of weapons forms, but is distinguished by its unique staff (6 ft) and ōdachi kata. Unlike modern Japanese budō, which was created for the masses and is largely sport-oriented, kobudō (“ko” being short for koryū, meaning traditional or old) was designed for the warrior, whose sole purpose was to kill or be killed. Many of Japan’s modern budō have their roots in the Yagyū schools of combat. Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido, was a student of Yagyū Shingan-ryū. He received the rank of Shoden from a Shihan of the Edo-line of Yagyū Shingan-ryū (stemming from the sixth lineal-headmaster Goto Saburō -- hence the name Goto-ha).Ueshiba, Kisshomaru. (1985). in Aikido (Illustrated Japanese Classics) Likewise, Kano Jigoro, the founder of judo, trained under the seventh lineal-headmaster of the Edo-line (Yagyū Shingan-ryū Taijutsu), Ohshima Masateru. Yagyū Shingan-ryū Taijutsu (Edo line) is primarily located in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.

John Gottman, Ph.D., Licensed Clinical Psychologist . Accessed online 14 October 2008. Gottman was recognized in 2007 as one of the 10 most influential therapists of the past quarter century. \\"Gottman's research showed that it wasn't only how couples fought that mattered, but how they made up. Marriages became stable over time if couples learned to reconcile successfully after a fight.\\"  Predictions of divorce  Gottman developed multiple models, scales, and formulas to predict marital stability and divorce in couples, and has completed seven studies in this field. His research regarding newlywed couples are among him most well-known studies. This work concludes that the four negative behaviors which most successfully predict divorce are criticism of a partner's personality, contempt, from a position of superiority, defensiveness, and stonewalling, or emotional withdrawal from interactions. This is usually due to feeling overwhelmed by criticism. On the other hand, stable couples handle conflict in gentle, positive ways, and are supportive of each other. He developed the Gottman Method Couple's Therapy based on his research findings. The therapy aims to increase respect, affection, and closeness, break through and resolve conflict, generate greater understandings, and to keep conflict discussions calm. The Gottman Method seeks to help couples build happy and stable marriages. Gottman's therapy model focuses on the process of conflict within the marriage, and less on the content. His research is longitudinal, meaning that he gathers data on the couples over several years. = Studies = Gottman's predictions are based on perceived marital bond. In his 2000 study, Gottman conducted oral interviews with 95 newlywed couples. Couples were asked about their relationship, mutual history, and philosophy towards marriage. The interview measured the couple's perceptions of their history and marriage by focusing on the positive or negative qualities of the relationship expressed in the telling of the story. Rather than scoring the content of their answers, interviewers used the Oral History Interview coding system, developed by Buehlman and Gottman in 1996, to measure spouses' perceptions about the marriage and about each other. Therefore, the couples' perception was used to predict marital stability or divorce. The more positive their perceptions and attitudes were about their marriage and each other, the more stable the marriage. His models partly rely on Paul Ekman's method of analyzing human emotion and microexpressions.  1992  The original study was published by Gottman and Buehlman in 1992, in which they interviewed couples with children. A posteriori modeling yielded a discriminant function that discriminate who has divorced with 94% accuracy. Gottman believed that since early married life is a period of change and adjustment, and perceptions are being formed, he sought to predict marital stability and divorce through couples' perceptions during the first year of marriage.  1998  In a 1998 study, Gottman developed a model to predict which newlywed couples would remain married and which would divorce four to six years later. The model fits the data with 90% accuracy. Another model fits with 81% percent accuracy for which marriages survived after seven to nine years.  2000  Gottman's follow-up study with newlywed couples, published in 2000, used the Oral History Interview to predict marital stability and divorce. Gottman's model fit with 87.4% accuracy for classifying couples who divorce (or not) within the couples' first five years of marriage. He used couples' perceptions about their marriages and each other to model marital stability or divorce. =Critiques= Gottman has been criticized for describing this work as accurately predicting divorce. Generally this work involves simply fitting statistical models to a data set, not making predictions about events in the future. A 2001 paper by New York University professor Richard E. Heyman, \\"The hazard of predicting divorce without cross validation\\" analyzes 15 divorce prediction models and questions their validity. # When analyzing a given dataset, it is possible to overfit the model to the data, which will work extremely nice for this dataset, but will not work when tested on fresh data. # Ninety percent prediction may actually mean much less when considering false positives and the low base rates of divorce. > \\"Overfitting can cause extreme overinflation of predictive powers, > especially when oversampled extreme groups and small samples are used, as > was the case with Gottman et al. (1998; n = 60 couples for the prediction > analyses) and nearly all of the other divorce prediction studies ... > published studies that find extraordinary initial predictive results may aid > us in improving models of risk by identifying important risk factors. > Nonetheless, dissemination of 'predictive power' results in the popular > media must await supportive data on sensitivity, specificity, and predictive > value when the predictive equation is applied to independent samples. By > recognizing both the value and limitations of predictive studies, > professionals and the public alike will be served best.\\" Heyman shows his points by creating a divorce prediction model with a data set, and showing its low validity when the above considerations are tested. Gottman never published a reply to this critique. Journalist Laurie Abraham also disputed the prediction power of Gottman's method. Abraham writes, \\"What Gottman did wasn't really a prediction of the future but a formula built after the couples' outcomes were already known. This isn't to say that developing such formulas isn't a valuable — indeed, a critical — first step in being able to make a prediction. The next step, however —one absolutely required by the scientific method— is to apply your equation to a fresh sample to see whether it actually works. That is especially necessary with small data slices (such as 57 couples), because patterns that appear important are more likely to be mere flukes. But Gottman never did that.\\" The Gottman Relationship Institute claims that six of seven of Gottman's studies have been properly predictive, by a non-standard definition of prediction in which all that is required is that predictive variables, but not their specific relationship to the outcome, were selected in advance. However, Gottman's 2002 paper makes no claims to accuracy in terms of binary classification, and is instead a regression analysis of a two factor model where skin conductance levels and oral history narratives encodings are the only two statistically significant variables. Facial expressions using Ekman's encoding scheme were not statistically significant. Independent studies testing Gottman marriage courses Building Strong Families Program= BSF 15-Month Impact Report Independent research on the impact of Gottman's marriage strengthening programs for the general public has further questioned Gottman couple education programs. The largest independent evaluation of a marriage education curriculum developed by Gottman was conducted by Mathematica Policy Research at nine sites in five states. The study was titled, \\"Loving Couples, Loving Children,\\" and was a federally funded, multi-year Building Strong Families Program study contracted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families. The study group included low-income, unwed couples. An impact report released by the Office of Planning Research and Evaluation U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation. showed that the intervention had no positive impact and, in one case, \\"had negative effects on couples' relationships.\\"Building Strong Families Program Impact Report, Mathematica Policy Research, May 2010. =Supporting Healthy Marriage Project= An ongoing study by Manpower Development Research Corporation (MDRC), known as the Supporting Healthy Marriage Project (SHM), is evaluating Gottman's \\"Loving Couples, Loving Children\\" program among low-income, married couples. The multi-year, random assignment study is funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families. In an early impact study on the effectiveness of \\"skills-based relationship education programs designed to help low-income married couples strengthen their relationships and, in turn, to support more stable and more nurturing home environments and more positive outcomes for parents and their children,\\" MDRC reported Knox, Virginia, et al. \\"Early Impacts from the Supporting Healthy Marriage Evaluation,\\" MDRC, New York, NY, March 2012. \\"Overall, the program has shown some small positive effects, without clear indications (yet no clear negative proof) for improving the odds to stay together after 12 months.\\" The program is still ongoing. =Matthews, Wickrama and Conger = A study published by Matthews, Wickrama and Conger in 1996 based on couples' perceptions showed that spousal hostility, net of warmth, predicted with 80% accuracy which couples would divorce or not divorce within a year. Relations and effects In multiple analyses, Gottman has shown a plethora of relations and effects in marriage and divorce, some in peer- reviewed publications, while many others appear in Gottman's own books. Among those are * The physical elements in marital conflict (i.e., physical effects are central to the inability to think, etc., in conflict situations) for which he advises a 20-minute cooling period or physical relaxation.The Marriage Clinic, John Gottman, 1994 * The effects of \\"bids for connection.\\" That is the smallest bids people do to connect and how the other reacts. For example, happy couples do have many more \\"bids for connection\\" when together, and much more \\"turn towards\\" response, and much, much fewer \\"turn away\\" - the most negative reaction. The book dedicated to this element is \\"The Relationship Cure.\\" * The concept of \\"trust,\\" which Gottman defines as having each others backs.The Science of Trust, John Gottman, 2011 * The neutral affect provides a way out of negative interactions as most interactions do not transition directly from negative to positive. The degree of neutral affect is often overlooked as a predictor of relationship success due to the very fact that the neutral affect is simply neutral. * The dynamic to cause divorce in the short term is different from that causing divorce later. Early divorce is characterized by the \\"four horsemen\\" of bad fighting, whereas later divorce is characterized by lower positive affect in earlier stages of the relationship. * Anger is not at all bad for relationships. Happy couples are as frequently angry as unhappy couples. It seems that how people react to anger and how destructive they get is the crucial factor rather than the frequency of anger or fights. Gottman even says that anger is functional in marriage. * 69% of happy couples still have *the very same* unresolved conflicts after 10 years, yet remain happy because they do not get gridlocked in the conflict and manage to get around it.The Marriage Clinic, John Gottman, 1994 =Contempt and marriage= Gottman's Cascade Model of Relational Dissolution states that there are four major emotional reactions that are destructive and thus are the four predictors to a divorce: criticism, defensiveness, stonewalling, and contempt. Among these four, Gottman considers contempt the most important of them all. =Seven Principles= In The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work, his most popular book, Gottman discusses behaviors that he observed in marriages that are successful and those that are detrimental to marriage, based on research conducted at his \\"Love Lab\\" in Seattle, Washington. He outlines seven principles that will reinforce the positive aspects of a relationship and help marriages endure during the rough moments. Practical solutions Here is a partial list of methods and practices developed by Gottman for marriage and child-rearing: =Therapist education= The Gottman Institute certifies new therapists regularly. Three levels of professional training are generally delivered through intensive two-day seminars or through at-home or online study to train therapists in Gottman Method Couples Therapy:\\"Research-based couples therapy training for individuals and groups,\\" The Gottman Relationship Institute website, retrieved November 26, 2012. * Learn to integrate research-based methods and inspire transformation in your work with couples. * Identify the communication patterns, friendship basis, and conflict management dynamics that characterize enduring intimate relationships. * Discover a roadmap for helping couples to compassionately manage their conflicts, deepen their friendship and intimacy, and share their life purpose and dreams. =Pre-birth workshop= Bringing Baby Home is a two- day seminar to help prepare would-be parents to a new baby, using 18 exercises and other tricks. In a peer-reviewed paper, Gottman shows that for a randomly controlled (but not blinded) experiment, couples attending the workshop were tremendously better off later, as follows: Without the workshop, 70% of couples had lower marital satisfaction relative to before birth (a common finding); 58% of mothers had some symptoms of depression after giving birth. For mothers who participated in the workshop only 22% of mothers had depressive symptoms. =Self-help books= Gottman has authored and co- authored over 40 books for a general audience, with research-backed advice for improving marriages, raising emotionally intelligent children, and on how to bring a new baby home without damaging the relationship. = The Gottman Method of Relationship Therapy = Personal life  John Gottman was born in the Dominican Republic to Orthodox Jewish parents. His father was a rabbi in pre-WWII Vienna. John was educated in a Lubavitch yeshiva elementary school in Brooklyn, and he observes kosher and the Sabbath. Over three decades ago, he married Julie Gottman née Schwartz, a psychotherapist. His two previous marriages had ended in divorce. The couple currently live in Washington state.

Like its predecessors, All Tomorrow's Parties is a speculative fiction novel set in a postmodern, dystopian, postcyberpunk future. The novel borrows its title from a song by Velvet Underground. It is written in the third person and deals with Gibsonian themes of emergent technology. The novel was initially published by Viking Press on October 7, 1999. Plot summary The book has three separate but overlapping stories, with the repeated appearance of shared characters. The San Francisco/Oakland Bay Bridge, the overarching setting of the trilogy, functions as a shared location of their convergence and resolution. The first story features former cop Berry Rydell, the protagonist of Virtual Light. Rydell quits a temporary job as a security guard at the Lucky Dragon convenience store to run errands for atrophied computer hacker Colin Laney (the protagonist of Idoru), who lives in a cardboard box in a subway in Shinjuku, Tokyo. As a child, Laney was the subject of pharmaceutical trials which damaged his nervous system. As a result, he suffers from a form of attention deficit disorder but gains the ability to discern nodal points in the undifferentiated flow of information, and from that he acquires a certain predictive faculty. This makes him ideal for the role of \\"netrunner\\" or data analyst. A side effect of 5-SB, the drug administered to Laney, causes the user to become attached to strong personalities. As a result, Laney has become obsessed with media baron Cody Harwood of Harwood/Levine, a powerful public relations firm. He spends his life surfing the net from his enclave in the subway, searching for traces of Harwood in the media. From this, Laney foresees a crucial historical shift which may precede the end of the world \\"as we know it\\". He predicts that Harwood, who had also taken 5-SB before (albeit voluntarily, with the knowledge of the consequences), knows this and will try to shape this historical shift to his liking. To stop Harwood, Laney hires Rydell under the guise of a courier to travel to San Francisco where he believes the next nodal point will congeal. The second story concerns ex- bicycle messenger Chevette Washington, also from Virtual Light, who is on the run from her ex-boyfriend. She escapes to her former home, San Francisco's bridge community, to find refuge and revisit her past. She is accompanied by Tessa, an Australian media sciences student who visits the bridge to film a documentary on \\"interstitial communities\\". The third story follows a mysterious, left-handed mercenary named Konrad. Although Konrad is employed by Harwood, he appears to be directed by his own motives. In particular, Konrad aligns his movements with the Tao, the spontaneous, universal energy path of Taoist philosophy. Characters Characters with point-of-view chapters: *Colin Laney – data analyst with an ability to sense nodal points (previously appeared in Idoru). *Chevette Washington – an ex-bike messenger who lived on the Bridge for several years and is on the run from an abusive boyfriend (Virtual Light). *Berry Rydell – a rent-a-cop and former lover of Chevette who is working as a security guard at a convenience store Lucky Dragon in Los Angeles (Virtual Light). *Shinya Yamazaki – self-described \\"student of existential sociology\\" (Virtual Light, Idoru). *Konrad – Taoist assassin hired by Harwood. *Silencio – a savant boy with an extreme fascination with watches and the talent to find them, no matter the circumstances. *Fontaine – a Bridge resident and pawn-shop owner who takes Silencio into his care. (Virtual Light) *Boomzilla – a street impresario with designs on Tessa's balloon camera. Other characters: *Tessa – Chevette's media student roommate, who drives Chevette to the Bridge in her van in order to make a documentary on its inhabitants. *Rei Toei – a holographic idol (the beautiful \\"emergent system\\" from Idoru). *Buell Creedmore – an alcoholic/drug addict country singer with a short temper and a knack for being in the wrong place at the right time. Although he tries to pass himself off as a native Southerner, he later reveals he was born and raised in New Jersey. *Maryalice – PR for Buell (Idoru). *Carson – Chevette's abusive ex. *Cody Harwood – head of a PR company, extremely powerful behind- the-scenes player (Virtual Light). *The Suit – an impoverished ex-salaryman who lives in the Tokyo subway and repaints his suit daily instead of purchasing a fresh one. Major themes Major recurring Gibsonian themes which feature heavily in All Tomorrow's Parties are the sociological impact of emergent technology (notably nanotechnology and artificial intelligence), millennial alienation, the commodification of the counterculture, the existence of nodal points in history (most notably the dawn of the nuclear age in 1911), and the notion of the interstitial. Despite the novel's oblique reference to Madame Curie, Gibson has stated that his placement of the last major nodal point in 1911 was a \\"viewpoint joke,\\" unconnected to factual events in that year. He had heard a story that Virginia Woolf \\"pinned the beginning of the modern era on a particular weekend in 1911.\\" (Woolf had actually declared that human nature underwent a fundamental change \\"on or about December 1910,\\" which inspired the belief that the modernist literary movement began around that time.) The author's long-time fascination with Japanese culture continues in this novel. Literary significance and reception The novel was critically well-received, with particular note given to Gibson's vivid, well-realised setting and dense prose, though reviewers found its ending to be anti-climactic. Sci Fi Weekly reviewer Curt Wohleber praised the \\"precision and economy\\" of All Tomorrow's Parties in comparison to its sometimes dull predecessors. Gibson scholar Tatiana Rapatzikou located the novel's significance in the fact that it had several motifs, themes and characters in common with Virtual Light and Idoru \\"without being sequential\\". In the words of The Guardian journalist Steven Poole, the novel completed Gibson's development \\"from science-fiction hotshot to wry sociologist of the near future\\".

Its first appearance on an album was on Live Phish Volume 2, a 2001 release featuring a concert from 1994.https://www.allmusic.com/album/live-phish-vol-2-7-16-94-sugarbush- summerstage-north-fayston-vt-mw0000591069 Though it follows the same basic structure in every performance (see The Divided Sky and You Enjoy Myself for other examples of songs in which variation occurs within a fixed structure), Trey Anastasio narrates a different story at every concert. The song's introduction is an a cappella \\"oom pah pah\\" melody sung by all members of the band. After its first appearance on record, the song later appeared on Live Phish Volume 13 (2002, recorded 1994), Live Phish Volume 14 (2002, recorded 1996), Colorado '88 (2006, recorded 1988), Vegas 96 (2007, recorded 1996 and featuring Les Claypool and Larry LaLonde), The Clifford Ball (2009, recorded 1996) and Chicago '94 (2012, recorded 1994).  \\"Harpua\\" section  A section of Gamehendge-related lyrics, concerning \\"me and Harpua\\", follows the a cappella introduction. They are occasionally improvised upon, but the melody remains the same. The Harpua section is composed in 7/8 time.  The story  A new guitar lick follows the end of the \\"Harpua\\" section, introducing a unique story that Trey Anastasio tells at every performance of the song. Rarely, Jon Fishman interjects with humorous asides during the narration. It is often (more clearly) revealed in this section that Harpua is a dog. Also, a character named Jimmy (through several performances it revealed that Jimmy is really Fishman i.e. 12/06/1996, 07/29/2003), who owns a cat called Poster Nutbag is always featured. Poster Nutbag will always be dead by the end of the story, often as a result of a disastrous occurrence (see below.) Other recurring themes included: *A village (usually in Gamehenge or a Utopian state, surrounded by forest and mountains) *Characters from Gamehenge (such as Wilson) *Making a reference to the venue and date of the concert *A very brief cover of another song to complement the plot of the story **\\"Voodoo Chile\\" by Jimi Hendrix on 6/17/94 **\\"Also Sprach Zarathrustra\\" [better known as the theme from 2001: A Space Odyssey] by Richard Strauss on 7/16/94 **\\"War Pigs\\" by Black Sabbath on 10/31/94 **\\"Beat It\\" by Michael Jackson on 10/31/95 **\\"I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart\\" and \\"Suspicious Minds\\" by Elvis on 12/06/96 **\\"Champagne Supernova\\" by Oasis on 12/29/96 **\\"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\\" by The Proclaimers on 12/30/97 **The band also performed the entire Dark Side of the Moon (Pink Floyd) album on 11/02/98 **\\"Fooled Around and Fell in Love\\" by Elvin Bishop on 7/29/03 **\\"I Kissed A Girl\\" by Katy Perry on 8/16/09 **\\"Killing in the Name\\" by Rage Against the Machine on 7/4/10 (this song was covered in its entirety) **\\"\\"After Midnight\\" by JJ Cale on 9/6/15 (this song was covered in its entirety) **\\"Once in a Lifetime\\" by Talking Heads on 9/6/15 (this song was covered in its entirety) **\\"United We Stand\\" by Tony Hiller and Peter Simmons on 9/6/15 (this song was covered in its entirety)  The death of Poster Nutbag  One way or another, Trey will kill off Poster Nutbag at or near the very end of the story using a natural disaster or some other form of death. This results in a conversation between Jimmy (narrated by Page McConnell) and his father (narrated by Mike Gordon) that is generally the same every time it is performed. Father: Jimmy? Jimmy: Yes, dad? Father: Jimmy, I have bad news. Jimmy: What is it, dad? Father: It's about your cat... Poster. Jimmy: Poster Nutbag? Father: Your cat died! Poster is dead (2x) Poster's so dead Father: How about a goldfish? Jimmy: I don't want a goldfish (3x), I want a dog... A dog...  A Dog in the Station  This request on Jimmy's part provokes the beginning of the next section, which is a new song in a poppish format.: There's a dog in the station With an ugly mutation And it needs lubrication each day There's a dog in the station Contemplating rotation As a form of recreation and play A dog... At this point there is a blues jam on the piano by Page McConnell. Then: There's a dog in the station With a bad reputation It's a sign of the nation's decay But the dog in the station Doesn't need a vacation As the people rush by dressed in gray... A dog... A final jam through the melody of \\"Dog in the Station\\" and a recapitulation of the lick that introduced the \\"story\\" section on top of a final \\"A dog....\\" ends the song.

Gates studied at the Musicians Institute in Los Angeles, California, as part of the Guitar Institute of Music program, studying jazz and classical guitar. Gates is of Spanish and German ancestry. CareerAvenged Sevenfold= Gates performing live in 2017 Gates was featured on the EP Warmness on the Soul which contains select songs from the first album as well as his new version of \\"To End the Rapture\\". His name on Avenged Sevenfold's debut album was \\"Synyster Gates\\". On the Avenged Sevenfold DVD All Excess, Gates claimed that his name was created on a drunken drive through the park with The Rev. Gates was voted Sexiest Male in the 2008 Kerrang! Readers Poll. In 2010, Guitar World listed him as one of the 30 greatest shredders of all time. They described him as being able to perform finger-twisting licks, acrobatic sweeps, devilish chromatics and towering dual-harmonies. Gates was chosen as one of Guitar Hero's 50 fastest guitarists. On Guitar World's 2010 Readers Poll, Gates was chosen Snappiest Dresser and the Best Metal Guitarist. Rock One Magazine's 2010 Readers Poll voted Gates the No. 3 best musician in the industry. On April 20, 2011, Gates won the Revolver Golden God award for Best Guitarist along with bandmate Zacky Vengeance. Avenged Sevenfold picked up numerous other awards and delivered the headlining performance of the night. Zacky Vengeance (left) and Gates performing in 2011 In the special edition of Revolver magazine that was released the same day as the Nightmare album, Gates stated that he originally started out writing the song \\"So Far Away\\" in honor of his grandfather. However, the song is now primarily about his former bandmate, best friend and previous drummer of Avenged Sevenfold, The Rev, who died on December 28, 2009. =Pinkly Smooth= Gates and The Rev played in an experimental metal band named Pinkly Smooth. Formed in the summer of 2001 in Huntington Beach, California, the band featured ex-Ballistico members Buck Silverspur on bass and D-Rock on drums. The band released one album, Unfortunate Snort on Bucktan Records, which features a crossover sound of mostly punk, ska and progressive metal. Former Avenged Sevenfold bassist Justin Sane played keyboards and piano on the album. There was speculation that Pinkly Smooth was going to produce another record, but due to the death of the Rev, it is highly unlikely that they will produce any more material. However, Gates has said that he would consider remastering the tracks from Unfortunate Snort and re-releasing the album. Influences Besides metal music, Gates is a big fan of jazz, gypsy jazz, classical, and avant-garde. He cites Dimebag Darrell, Django Reinhardt, Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Slash, Marty Friedman, Zakk Wylde, Allan Holdsworth, Mr. Bungle, Frank Gambale, Oingo Boingo, and Danny Elfman as his artistic influences. Personal life Gates married Michelle DiBenedetto on May 7, 2010.

Whelping Box with Extension Wall. Whelping boxes are often modular in design, allowing the addition of extension rooms and accessories. Doors and rails are adjustable with multiple heights for the bitch and puppies. Internal pads for absorbency are easily washed and replaced for cleanliness. A whelping box, also known as a nesting box or whelping pen, is designed to protect puppies during birth (whelping) and early life by keeping them safely contained, protected from cold, and safe from the danger of crushing or smothering by the mother. Whelping boxes vary from improvised cardboard boxes to purpose built equipment, typically made of plywood or plastic. Desirable features include ease of cleaning and sanitation, extendability, and toughness. In some breeding environments portability is also desirable. This is typically achieved through light weight design and emphasis on simple setup and takedown. Commercially available whelping boxes often feature accommodations for accessories such as heat control devices and IP camera attachment. The sides of the box are designed to be high enough to safely contain the puppies, yet low enough to allow the mother to enter and leave comfortably, with consideration given to her protruding mammary glands. Alternatively, the box is provisioned with a doorway with adjustable height for the same purpose. The bottom of the box may be lined with specially designed \\"whelping pads,\\" or layers of newspaper (or fabric) to provide insulation from cold floors and to absorb fluids. Fabric covers or partial covers are often used on top to provide a \\"den-like\\" environment for the mother. Full covers may be used to prevent puppies from escaping.

The Romans, led by the consuls Gaius Atilius Regulus and Lucius Aemilius Papus, defeated the Celts led by the Gaesatae kings Concolitanus and Aneroëstes. This removed the Celtic threat from Rome and allowed the Romans to extend their influence over northern Italy. BackgroundMobilisation= Rome had been at peace with the tribes of Cisalpine Gaul, the area along the Po valley in northern Italy, since inconclusive skirmishing ceased in 238 BC. Indeed, when a force of Transalpine Celts had crossed the Alps into Italy in 230 BC, it had been the Boii of Cisalpine Gaul who had repelled them. The Romans had sent an army but found that it was not needed. However, when the Romans partitioned the formerly- Celtic territory of Picenum in 234 BC, they created resentment among its neighbours, the Boii and the Insubres. This was deepened in 232 BC when the Romans passed a law allocating large areas of formally Celtic land to poorer citizens. These actions were recognised at the time as being provocative to the Celts and attracted some opposition because of it. In 225 BC, the Boii and Insubres paid large sums of money to the Gaesatae, mercenaries from Transalpine Celtic territories led by Aneroëstes and Concolitanus, to fight with them against Rome. The Romans, alarmed by the Celtic mobilisation, made a treaty giving Carthaginian General Hasdrubal the Fair unimpeded control of Hispania so that they could concentrate on the threat closer to home.Polybius, Histories 2:22 The Romans called upon their allies in Italy to supply troops. Consul Lucius Aemilius Papus had four legions of Roman citizens, 22,000 men in total, as well as 32,000 allied troops. He stationed the majority of his forces at Ariminum. He placed 54,000 Sabines and Etruscans on the Etruscan border under the command of a praetor, and sent 40,000 Umbrians, Sarsinates, Veneti, and Cenomani to attack the home territory of the Boii to distract them from the battle. The other consul, Gaius Atilius Regulus, had an army the same size as that of Papus but was stationed in Sardinia at the time. There was also a reserve of 21,500 citizens and 32,000 allies in Rome itself and one legion in each of Sicily and Tarentum.Polybius, Histories 2:23–24 =Celtic victory at Faesulae= The Celts overran Etruria and began to march to Rome. The Roman troops who were stationed on the Etrurian border met them at Clusium, three days march from Rome, where both sides made camp. That night, the Celts, leaving their cavalry and their camp fires as a decoy, withdrew to the town of Faesulae (modern Fiesole) and built defensive obstacles. In the morning, the cavalry withdrew in full view of the Romans, who, thinking that the enemy were retreating, pursued them. The Celts gave battle from behind their defences and, with the advantage of position, were victorious after a hard battle. Six thousand Romans were killed, and the rest fell back to a defensible hill.Polybius, Histories 2:25 That night Papus arrived and made camp nearby. Aneroëstes persuaded the Celts to withdraw along the Etruscan coast with their booty and renew the war later when they were unencumbered. Papus pursued and harassed their rear but did not risk a pitched battle. The other Consul, Regulus, had crossed from Sardinia, landed at Pisa, and was marching towards Rome. His scouts met the Celts' advance guard head on near Telamon (modern Talamone), in an area called Campo Regio.Polybius, Histories 2:26–27 Battle Regulus put his troops in fighting order and advanced in an attempt to occupy a hill above the road which would block the Celts retreat. The Celts, unaware of Regulus' arrival, assumed that Papus had sent some of his cavalry ahead and so sent some of their own cavalry and light infantry to contest the hill. As soon as they realised that they faced a second full Roman army they deployed their infantry facing both front and rear. They placed the Gaesatae and Insubres at the rear against Papus and the Boii and Taurisci at the front against Regulus, with their flanks protected by wagons and chariots. A small force guarded the booty on another hill nearby.Polybius, Histories 2:27–28 The battle over the main hill was fierce, and although Papus sent cavalry to assist, Regulus was killed and his head brought to the Celtic leaders. Eventually, however, the Roman cavalry secured possession of the hill. The Romans advanced from both directions, throwing volleys of javelins, which devastated the vulnerable Gaesatae at the rear, who were fighting naked with small shields. Some rushed wildly at the Romans and were slaughtered. Others withdrew into the body of the army, their retreat causing disorder among their allies. After this the insurbres advanced to take their place and The Roman javelin-throwers withdrew into the ranks, and the hastati advanced in maniples. The Insubres, Boii, and Taurisci held their ground tenaciously, and the Roman hastati could not brake them. evantually the hastati withdrew and allowed their more experienced principes to advance. This started to grind the determined celitc to dust but still refused to break. Despite their fierce resistance the Roman cavalry rode down from the hill and into the flank of the exhausted Celts, who decided to die where they stood. The Celtic infantry was slaughtered and their cavalry put to flight.Polybius, Histories 2:28–30 Around 40,000 Celts were killed and 10,000, including Concolitanus, taken prisoner. Aneroëstes escaped with a small group of followers, who committed suicide with him. After the battle Papus marched the combined armies into Liguria and the territory of the Boii to conduct punitive actions.Polybius, 'The Histories of Polybius Book 2. pp. 21–31. Aftermath Papus was awarded a triumph for his part in the victory,Acta Triumphalia Degrassi 78f., 550; Florus 1.20.3: Eutropius 3.5. which ended forever the Celtic threat to the Roman capital. In 224 BC two Roman armies invaded the Celtic territories and forced the Boii to submit. In 223 and 222 BC further major Roman victories followed and the Celts surrendered, giving up large tracts of land. Roman citizens were settled on this land, to the frustrated resentment of the Celts. This resentment played a significant role in the Celts going over to Hannibal when he crossed the Alps in 218 BC as part of the Second Punic War.

It was distributed by MGM Distribution Co. Plot Ryan Weaver (Ray Liotta) is arrested in New York City in connection to a series of murders that he says he did not commit. Even though police lieutenant Aldo Hines (Héctor Elizondo) at one point broke protocol during the arrest (which later enraged Weaver), the authorities have enough hard evidence to have Weaver transported to Los Angeles to face trial. He and another prisoner, Stubbs (Brendan Gleeson), are escorted by four US marshals on a Boeing 747-200 on a commercial flight. Even though it is Christmas Eve, the 747 is nearly empty, with only eleven people on board. During the flight, Stubbs breaks free while using the bathroom and begins a shootout with the marshals. A stray bullet fired from one of the marshals' sidearms punches a hole in the fuselage, instantly triggering an explosive decompression. Amidst the chaos, the captain is fatally shot and the first officer dies when his head slams into the yoke, disengaging the autopilot in the process. Weaver frees himself and attempts to save the last remaining marshal, but fails when both Stubbs shoots the marshal dead, after being shot himself. Weaver appears to be horrified by the ordeal, increasing the passengers' trust in him. With the pilots dead, Teri Halloran (Lauren Holly), a flight attendant, makes her way into the cockpit and learns she is the only one left capable of keeping the 747 from crashing. To make matters worse, the plane is heading into a storm which threatens severe turbulence. Weaver's behavior becomes increasingly erratic since he is paranoid of being sentenced to death upon landing and occasionally suffers nervous breakdowns. He then locks the passengers in the crew's cabin; and sexually assaults and strangles Maggie (Catherine Hicks), one of the other flight attendants, to death. He then calls the FBI control center at LAX and threatens to crash the 747 into their facility since he is now willing to do anything to avoid being arrested. His motives had become clear to Teri after she speaks, via the aircraft's radio, with Hines. Teri must be instructed by radio from Captain Bowen (Ben Cross) how to reprogram the autopilot to land at LAX, but her task is complicated by Weaver's obscene and constant interruptions. After the plane barely survives turbulence during the storm, Weaver breaks into the avionics bay and smashes the server running the primary autopilot software, rendering the first landing attempt unsuccessful, and forcing a last second go-around. It skims a rooftop Japanese restaurant and a multi-story parking garage, but regains the air. The plane's landing gear picks up an SUV, which hinders the next landing at LAX. The backup autopilot has now engaged, and Teri makes efforts to turn the plane around. The LAX airport chief sends an F-14 Tomcat to intercept the 747. Teri begs LAX not to have her shot down, insisting she can land the plane. Weaver breaks into the cockpit with an axe and tries to kill her, but the F-14 destroys the SUV instead, shaking the 747 and giving Teri a chance to attack. She grabs one of the marshal's guns and, in the midst of Weaver's assault, manages to load a spare bullet. She finally shoots Weaver through the head and kills him. Teri returns to the pilot's seat and with Bowen's radio assistance, safely lands the 747 using the autopilot. Despite Weaver's claims that he killed them all, the other crew and passengers are found alive.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B-\\" on an A+ to F scale. Both Roger Ebert and James Berardinelli rated the film one star out of four, denouncing the implausible storyline as well as the casting of Lauren Holly as an action heroine. G. Allen Johnson of the San Francisco Examiner called the film \\"an absolute bore\\". Lauren Holly's performance in the film earned her a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actress, though she lost to Demi Moore for G.I. Jane. Turbulence was also nominated for Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property but lost to Con Air. At the Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, Holly was nominated for Worst Actress but lost to Alicia Silverstone for Excess Baggage. Sequels Despite its box office failure, the film did well enough on home video to become a trilogy with two new direct-to-video sequels. They are Turbulence 2: Fear of Flying and Turbulence 3: Heavy Metal, each with a different cast.

The play's title, taken from a folk song, refers to a 19th-century escapist vision of utopia. Mamet's New Play Detonates The Fury of Sexual Harassment, an October 26, 1992 review by Frank Rich of The New York TimesParker, Kathleen, syndicated column of July 8, 2008, \\"While we wait, Bush says little,\\" Albany Times Union, July 8, 2008, at A11, also found at \\"Bush's dreamscape,\\" by Kathleen Parker, on the Detroit News website. Accessed July 8, 2008. Mamet adapted his play into a 1994 film of the same name. Plot summaryAct I= Carol, a college student, is in the office of her professor, John. She expresses frustration that she does not understand the material in his class, despite having read the assigned books and attending his lectures. Of particular concern is a book written by John himself, wherein he questions the modern insistence that everyone participate in higher education, referring to it as \\"systematic hazing\\". While talking with Carol, he is often interrupted by the phone ringing. John is about to be granted tenure, along with a handsome raise. Anticipating this, he is about to close on a new house, but his wife repeatedly calls with last-minute issues, demanding that he meet her at the home as soon as possible. After initially appearing insensitive, John eventually decides to help Carol, telling her that he \\"likes her\\" and that he also felt similar frustrations as a student. He takes the blame for her not understanding what he is talking about and agrees to give her an \\"A\\" if she'll return to his office several more times to discuss the material. At one heated point in the discussion he goes to put his hand on her shoulder to comfort her, but she violently shakes it off. Finally, Carol has warmed to John and is on the verge of divulging a secret when the phone rings again and John's wife tells him that the realtor problems were all a scheme to get him back to the house for a surprise reception in his honor. He departs for home immediately. =Act II= Carol is back in John's office, but more poised than before. John's tenure is threatened because Carol has filed a formal complaint with the committee, accusing him of being sexist and pornographic. She has documented daily occurrences of John's sexist remarks toward his students and describes his offer of giving her an \\"A\\" if she agrees to meet with him privately in his office. His hand on her shoulder is described as sexual harassment. John hopes to resolve the matter privately with Carol so that the complaint may be withdrawn from the tenure committee. He says he does not understand how his actions could have offended her so and attempts to convince her that he was only trying to help her without any ulterior motive. Carol decides it's best that she leave, but John stands in front of the door and grabs hold of her. Carol screams for help. =Act III= John has been denied tenure and suspended, with a possible dismissal, and is packing up his office. He has not been home to see his wife and family, staying at a hotel for two days trying to work out in his head what has happened. He has asked Carol to speak to him once more and she has obliged. Carol is even more forceful to name her instructor's flaws. She finds it hypocritical that a college professor could question the very system that offers him employment and gives him an academic platform to expound his views. She also makes reference to \\"her group\\", on whose behalf she speaks and from whom she seems to be getting advice and support as she files her complaints. In passing, John mentions that he has not been home recently. Carol reveals that if he had, he would have learned that her charges against him now amount to attempted rape. Carol offers to drop her charges if John would agree to her group's list of books to be removed from the university, which includes his own. John refuses. He angrily tells her to leave his office as his phone rings again. It is his wife, whom he affectionately calls \\"baby\\". Carol tells him not to refer to his wife that way. This causes John to finally snap completely and he savagely beats her, screams obscenities at her and holds a chair above her head as she cowers on the floor. As John calms down, realizing what he's just done, he quietly says, \\"Oh my God.\\" The play ends with Carol saying, \\"Yes...that's right.\\" Themes The principal themes of the play have centered on the overall comparison to the Anita Hill–Clarence Thomas debate during the Supreme Court hearing of the future Justice, and the amount of veracity which could be associated with the male side of the debate and the amount of veracity to associate with the female side.David Sauer, David Mamet's Oleanna, Series: Modern Theater Guides, Paperback: 128 pages, Publisher: Bloomsbury Academic; 1 edition (January 6, 2009), Language: English, . In the voice-over for the Criterion DVD edition of another Mamet film titled Homicide, Mamet stated that the theme of group affiliation was central to his portrayal of Carol when she announces her joining the activist group on campus.Homicide, The Criterion Edition, DVD voice-over.  Original productions  The play premiered in May 1992 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as the first production of Mamet's new Back Bay Theater Company.Oleanna debuts at Cambridge Mass., from the website of the David Mamet Society The premiere featured William H. Macy as John, a \\"smug, pompous, insufferable man whose power over academic lives he unconsciously abuses\\". Rebecca Pidgeon played the female lead, Carol, described by one critic as \\"Mamet's most fully realized female character...a mousy, confused cipher\\" whose failure to comprehend concepts and precepts presented in John's class motivated her appeal for personal instruction. In October, a year after the Anita Hill–Clarence Thomas hearings which \\"crystallized and concretized\\" Mamet's dramatization, it appeared off-Broadway at New York City's Orpheum Theatre, with Macy and Pidgeon reprising their roles. The production included a rewritten third scene. Critic Frank Rich provides a summary of the play in his review of the off-Broadway production: :Oleanna ... is an impassioned response to the Thomas hearings. As if ripped right from the typewriter, it could not be more direct in its technique or more incendiary in its ambitions. In Act I, Mr. Mamet locks one man and one woman in an office where, depending on one's point of view, an act of sexual harassment does or does not occur. In Act II, the antagonists, a middle-aged university professor and an undergraduate student, return to the scene of the alleged crime to try to settle their case without benefit of counsel, surrogates or, at times, common sense. :The result? During the pause for breath that separates the two scenes of Mr. Mamet's no-holds- barred second act, the audience seemed to be squirming and hyperventilating en masse, so nervous was the laughter and the low rumble of chatter that wafted through the house. The ensuing denouement, which raised the drama's stakes still higher, does nothing to alter the impression that \\"Oleanna\\" is likely to provoke more arguments than any play this year. Oleanna London premiere was staged at the Royal Court Theatre in 1993, directed by Harold Pinter.Oleanna by David Mamet, The Royal Court Theatre, 24 June 1993, from the official. Harold Pinter website David Suchet played John (in a Variety Club Award- winning performanceSuchet: Dark star, a June 2002 BBC article), and Lia Williams played Carol, in a version that used Mamet's original ending from the Cambridge production. As Pinter notes in personal correspondence to Mamet that Pinter also published on his website: :There can be no tougher or more unflinching play than Oleanna. The original ending is, brilliantly, \\"the last twist of the knife\\". She gets up from the floor (\\"Don't worry about me. I'm alright\\") and goes straight for the throat. The last line seems to me the perfect summation of the play. It's dramatic ice. Michael Billington's review in The Guardian endorsed Pinter's choice of ending, saying \\"by restoring Mamet's original ending, in which the professor is forced to confess his failings, Pinter also brings out the pain and tragedy of the situation\\".  Film adaptation  In 1994, Mamet directed his own film adaptation of Oleanna, starring William H. Macy and Debra Eisenstadt. Roger Ebert, whose review of the film is primarily about the off-Broadway production he saw over a year earlier, was \\"astonished\\" to report that Oleanna was not a very good film, characterizing it as awkward and lacking in \\"fire and passion\\"; this is in contrast to what Ebert wrote about the performance of the play he saw at the Orpheum: :Experiencing David Mamet's play \\"Oleanna\\" on the stage was one of the most stimulating experiences I've had in a theater. In two acts, he succeeded in enraging all of the audience – the women with the first act, the men with the second. I recall loud arguments breaking out during the intermission and after the play, as the audience spilled out of an off- Broadway theater all worked up over its portrait of...sexual harassment? Or was it self-righteous Political Correctness?Ebert's review of the film version of Oleanna, from the Chicago Sun-Times website  Revivals  A 2004 productionStiles and Eckhart to Clash In London Oleanna, Opening April 22, a 2004 Playbill article at the Garrick Theatre in London featured Aaron Eckhart and Julia StilesReview of Oleanna from The Guardian and was directed by Lindsay Posner.

Cancelled production  In 2014, a production of the play at Milwaukee's Alchemist Theatre was stopped after one performance when it received a cease- and-desist order from Mamet's representatives. The production had cast a man to play the character of Carol, making the play about same-sex sexual harassment.

A drangue can counter her destructive power driving the storms away. The kulshedra or kuçedra is a water, storm, fire and chthonic demon in Albanian mythology and folklore, usually depicted as a huge multi-headed female serpentine dragon. The kulshedra is believed to spit fire, cause drought, storms, flooding, earthquakes and other natural disasters against mankind. In Albanian mythology she is usually fought and defeated by a drangue, a semi-human winged divine hero and protector of mankind. Heavy thunderstorms are thought to be the result of their battles. In northern beliefs, the kulshedra can take possession of the sun and moon. In southern beliefs, she is described as an enormous female serpent who surrounds the world. According to this version, if she were ever to touch her tail with her mouth, she could destroy the whole world. It is said that she requires human sacrifices for accepting to postpone the natural disasters and catastrophes. According to folk beliefs, the kulshedra's earlier stage is the bolla, which has the appearance of a water and chthonic demonic serpent. The bolla's eyes remain shut for the whole year except on Saint George's Day, when it gazes the world and will devour any human on sight. The bolla will eventually morph into kulshedra if it lives many years without being seen by a human. The bollar and errshaja are considered intermediate forms of this serpent as it goes through a series of metamorphoses. These terms also signify serpents; the term bullar merely being a synonym for bolla in Southern Albania. In some regions the kulshedra is depicted like a female eel, turtle, frog, lizard or salamander. The kulshedra can also appear in the guise of a woman, who keeps her true nature hidden. As a semi-human divine figure she holds also positive qualities that emerge indirectly from Albanian folk tales, beliefs and rituals. It is said that the village where the kulshedra lives has great prosperity in agriculture and livestock. Indeed she absorbs by her breath foodstuffs from everywhere, and her village thives, while the affected villages become poor and do not prosper. According to folk beliefs people used to practice sacrifices to her so she could bring them good and stop any harmful action. Names The term bolla is etymologically related to Greek Φάλη, Φάλαινα 'monster, whale,' (although the relationship is not certain)., \\"Bolla\\", A Dictionary of Albanian Religion, Mythology, and Folk Culture, pp. 46–47. Kulshedra (; def. ) or kuceder (; def. ) derives from the Latin ', roughly meaning an \\" snake\\"., \\"Kulshedra\\", A Dictionary of Albanian Religion, Mythology, and Folk Culture, pp. 153–156. The term bullar is given as a Southern Albanian variant by some sources. Origin of the myth The legendary battle of a heroic deity associated with thunder and weather, like drangue, who fights and slays a huge multi-headed serpent associated with water and storms, like kulshedra, has been preserved from a common motif of Indo-European mythology. Similar characters with different names but same motifs representing the dichotomy of \\"good and evil\\" – mainly reflected by the protection of the community from storms – are found also in the folklore of other Balkan peoples. Bolla The bolla is said to remain closed-eyed until Saint George's Day, where it peers into the world, and will devour any human that approaches it. It is explained in folklore that Saint George had cursed the beast to be forever blind except on his feast day. Kulshedra Kulshedra is generally considered to be a female dragon, like a multi-headed serpent form, but it is known to have pendulous drooping breasts touching the ground, thus some German commentators have stated she might be also regarded as a hag. Kulshedra is furthermore said to be covered in wooly red hair, have a long tail, and have seven to twelve heads. It is also said to spit fire. > Kulshedra's milk and urine are both considered poisonous. Kulshedra can also appear in the guise of a human female; its appearance in an ordinary woman's guise known locally for example in Dukagjini, Kosovo. It may also appear in the form of a female lizard, turtle, frog, or salamander. At the same time, kulshedra is widely considered to be a storm demon. doi:10.2307/2843266. Kulshedra is believed to cause drought and other water-related issues for humanity such as torrents, tempests, water shortages, big storms, flooding, or other natural disasters. Often to placate it, a human sacrifice must be made, as witnessed in the tale of the hero Qerosi (\\"Scurfhead\\"). In southern beliefs, she is described as an enormous female serpent who surrounds the world. According to this version, if she were ever to touch her tail with her mouth, she could destroy the whole world. In northern beliefs, the kulshedra can take possesssion of the sun and moon. To frighten the evil demon, the Albanian tribesmen used to shoot in the sky or provoke great noise with metal objects, even by ringing the church bells. \\"The male form, called Kulshedër, acts as a devil\\".  Metamorphosis  According to folk belief, a snake after living a certain number of years will metamorphosize into a bolla and eventually become the monstrous kulshedra. The belief that an ancient snake becomes a dragon is not unique to Albanian culture, and similar beliefs can be found for example in Hungary and Romania, as pointed out by Robert Elsie. In the Kosova town of Prishtina, the kulshedra begins life as a being invisible to mankind for the first twelve years of its life, after which it turns into a bolla (\\"a kind of serpent\\"), and afterwards it sprouts wings, becomes hairy, and begins to combat the drangue (dragúa). and citing it. But the folklore of Malësia and the Northern Mountain Range in Albania provides a more complex life cycle: when the serpent manages to live fifty years without being noticed by anyone, it becomes a bullar, a reptile that feeds milk to snakes, from which these snake derive their poison. If it lives another fifty years without being seen, it becomes an ershaj which coils around its human victim's neck, punctures his chest and eats the heart. When an ershaj (er̄šaj) lives for another century unseen, it finally becomes a kulshedra. (repr. 1973) cited by and In Tirana, kulshedra was said to begin life as a being hiding in a dark hole which became a snake after six months; the snake must grow an additional six months before it exhibited the behavior for which it could be properly called a kulshedra. Among the Albanian Kastrati tribe, it was believed that a snake sighted by a wren lost its ability to transform into a kulshedra.  Battles with Dragùa  Dragùa, sometimes called drangue or drangoni, is the male conqueror of the female monster kulshedra, whom he must fight to the death in collective beliefs. Their prime aim in life is to combat and slay Kulshedras. They thus spend much of their youth exercising and running around, so as to learn how to avoid kulshedra's urine and milk. When they sense a Kulshedra approaching, dragùas \\"go completely berserk and their souls depart from their bodies in preparation for the coming battle\\". When a human is attacked the dragùa will \\"fly to their assistance and slay kulshedra by pelting it with cudgels, ploughs, yokes, lances and stones, and even with uprooted trees and houses. Such attacks are seen by humans as lightning\\". Heavy thunderstorms are thought to be the result of the battle. The dragùas, even as infants, use the cradle to shield themselves from kulshedra's attacks, which consist of her urine and poisonous milk from her breasts. They also use this cradle as weapons. In the Northern Albania, the two are envisioned as battling perpetually in the bend of the Drani River in the Northern Mountain Range. But some folklore speaks of the dragùa accomplishing kulshedra's destruction by drowning, and in Central Albania, the hero is said to have drowned her, knocking her unconscious by throwing trees and boulders at her, and afterwards drowning her in Shkumbin, a river in central Albania. Dragùas are not the only beings said to have defeated Kulshedra. There are multiple folktales (see: Folktales and other stories with Kulshedra) in which saintsElsie, Robert (2000), \\"The Christian Saints of Albania\\". Balkanistica. 13: 43, 45. and folktale heroes not identified as dragùa have defeated Kulshedra., Albanian Folktales and Legends  Folktales and other stories with Bolla/Kulshedra  18th-century icon of Saint George and the Dragon by Çetiri brothers, from Ardenica Monastery, now in the National Museum of Medieval Art in Tirana. Saint George and Saint Elias (originally the Old Testament prophet Elijah) both have stories in which they fight (and defeat) a Bolla/Kulshedra. Saint Elias, in particular, is identified in some regions with the Dragùa and is also a weather god and provides protection against storms and fire. Some folktales involving the slaying of a Kulshedra include: * \\"The Daughter of the Moon and Sun\\": the kulshedra is slayed by The Daughter of the Moon and Sun, whose weapon is a point of light * \\"The Twins\\" (Binoshët): the kulshedra is slain by Zjerma, one of the twins (the other being Handa), whose weapons are silver swords * \\"The three friends and the Earthly Beauty\\" * \\"The three brothers and the three sisters\\" * \\"The youth and the maiden with stars on their foreheads and crescents on their breasts\\" * \\"The girl who became a boy\\" * \\"The snake and the king's daughter\\" * \\"The barefaced man and the Pasha's brother\\" * \\"The maiden who was promised to the sun\\"  Other mentions of Bolla/Kulshedra  On the Greek island Poros, once inhabited by a majority of Arvanites, the term Bullar is still used to describe water snakes, and in northern Albania, both Bolla and Bollar are used to describe grass snakes.

Early life and education Bumiller was born in Aalborg, Denmark, to a Danish mother and American father. The family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, when she was three years old. Bumiller attended Walnut Hills High School, where she reported for the school newspaper, the Walnut Hills Chatterbox. She graduated in 1974. Bumiller then attended Northwestern University as an undergraduate in the Medill School of Journalism, graduating in 1977. She wrote for the Daily Northwestern. She received a master's degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1979. Career Bumiller began her career at the Miami Herald. Her first journalism job in Washington was party reporter for The Washington Posts \\"Style\\" section, where she covered Washington society. In this role, Bumiller followed First Lady Nancy Reagan to the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer. In 1985, Bumiller moved to India and continued to write for the Style section of the Post. She also wrote her first book, May You Be the Mother of a Hundred Sons (Ballantine, 1991), described as \\"examination of daily life for women in India.\\" In 1989, when Weisman became Tokyo bureau chief for the Times, the couple moved again to Japan, where Bumiller continued to work for the Post and also began work on a second book, The Secrets of Mariko (Vintage, 1996). In 1992, Bumiller and Weisman moved to New York, where Weisman took up the post as deputy foreign editor for the Times. In 1995, Bumiller joined her husband at the Times, as a general assignment metro reporter. From fall 1999 until 2001, Bumiller became New York City Hall bureau chief, where she covered the mayoral administration of Rudolph Giuliani and Giuliani's abortive 2000 bid for the U.S. Senate against Hillary Clinton. During this time, Bumiller was a contributor to the \\"Public Lives\\" column, which profiled city officials. In 2001, Bumiller was promoted to White House correspondent for the Times, serving in that role from September 10, 2001 to 2006. Weisman followed her to become the paper's senior diplomatic correspondent for the Times. Bumiller was criticized by Eric Boehlert and Glenn Greenwald for failing to question George W. Bush on the run-up to the Iraq War. Reflecting on a March 6, 2003 presidential press conference before the invasion of Iraq, Bumiller said: \\"I think we were very deferential because ... it's live, it's very intense, it's frightening to stand up there. Think about it, you're standing up on prime- time live TV asking the president of the United States a question when the country's about to go to war. There was a very serious, somber tone that evening, and no one wanted to get into an argument with the president at this very serious time.\\" :Cited in: :* :and: :* At a panel discussion sponsored by Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism in November 2004, Bumiller stated: \\"You can't just say the president is lying...You can in an editorial, but I'm sorry, you can't in a news column...You can say Mr. Bush's statement was not factually accurate. You can't say the president is lying—that's a judgment call.\\" Transcript of panel discussion in Washington, D.C., sponsored by Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism (November 4, 2004). Beginning in June 2006, Bumiller took a one-year leave of absence from the Times to write a biography of U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. During this period, Bumiller was also a Public Policy Scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (September 2006—February 2007) and a Transatlantic Fellow at the German Marshall Fund. Bumiller's book, Condoleezza Rice: An American Life, was published by Random House in December 2007. The book, which was based on ten interviews with Rice as well as interviews from 150 others, portrays Rice catering to Bush's desire to invade Iraq, and it describes her being taken completely by surprise when Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian elections. Jacob Heilbrunn, reviewing the book in The New York Times, wrote that Bumiller \\"brings a keen eye to Rice, probing not only her tenure as a policy maker and her close ties to George W. Bush, but also her personal and professional past. In 2008, Bumiller covered the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain for the Times. During the campaign, McCain at times clashed with Bumiller and other Times writers. From 2008 to early 2013, Bumiller served as Pentagon correspondent; in this role, she traveled with the Secretary of Defense and was embedded with U.S. forces in Afghanistan. In May 2009, the Times published a controversial front-page article by Bumiller citing an unreleased Pentagon report for the proposition that one in seven detainees released from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp \\"returned to terrorism or militant activity\\"; this figure was criticized as inflated in a Times op-ed by Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann, and Times public editor Clark Hoyt wrote that editors should have taken a more skeptical approach. Subsequently, Bumiller was named Washington editor. In September 2015, executive editor Dean Baquet of The New York Times announced that Bumiller would replace Carolyn Ryan as the Washington bureau chief.  Personal life  In fall 1979, Bumiller met Steven R. Weisman, then the White House correspondent for The New York Times, and the two married in 1983. They have two children: a girl born in Japan and their second child, a boy was born after the couple moved to New York in the early 1990s.

The name of the game is taken from the Welsh word Mabinogi, a Welsh anthology of legend, and the settings for the game are loosely based on Welsh mythology. The game engine features hand- painted textures stylized with edge detection outlining. The game world is developed continuously, through the release of important updates (referred to as \\"Generations\\" and \\"Seasons\\") that introduce new areas, additional features such as pets and new skills, and advancement of the storyline. The user interface is simple and designed in the likeness of Microsoft Windows' task bar. Mabinogi was built on a hybrid Value Added Services model (which varies slightly for each game localization) that allows free play and the subscription of paid packages, purchased through the game shop. In South Korea, beginning with the Chapter 3 patch, Mabinogi changed to micro- transactions. It now allows 24-hour free play and the Item Shop only offers items and subscriptions for added options. The game service is available in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mainland China, North America, Oceania, Israel. The North American closed beta test began on January 30, 2008. The pre-open beta only available to Fileplanet users was released on March 5, 2008. The full open beta was released on March 6, 2008. The North American localization of Mabinogi was released on March 27, 2008. During the 2007 Gstar game show in Seoul, South Korea, Nexon announced an Xbox 360 version of Mabinogi. However, in September 2009, they had announced that, even though the development was finished, the release of the console version has been indefinitely suspended after evaluations of the game through their business decisions. Gameplay The player is not limited by any class other than the character's race, and is free to level up any of the different skills available. The combination of skill choices, age, items, physical constitution, and other variables such as user titles, is what makes up the character. The gameplay is largely skill-based. To learn and improve skills, Ability Points (AP) are required. There are also various social aspects, like sitting around a campfire, playing music, having a friendly chat, sharing food, as well as making use of different facial expressions to make user interaction more colorful. There are currently three continents, Uladh, Belvast and Iria. If the player decides to start as a human, he or she will begin their game in the Uladh village of Tir Chonaill, or the Qilla Base Camp in Iria. If the player chooses to be an elf, the game begins in Iria at Filia, in the region Connous. Should the player decide to start as a Giant, they will begin their game at Vales, in the region Physis, which is located far north in the continent of Iria. As of the Generation 13 patch, a realm outside of Erinn, Avon (based on Stratford-upon-Avon), is able to be accessed by an item found in the first mainstream quest of that generation. As of Generation 15, Belvast Island was introduced (based upon the city Belfast). This island is accessible by taking a ship from the continent of Uladh. =Character creation and development= Characters are created by using Character Cards. Prior to the New Beginnings update, accounts received one character card upon creation, but will now receive six cards instead. These free cards cannot be regained unless another account is created, although more cards can be obtained ingame and through the Cash Shop. If the account is without any characters, a single free card will be given. This card can always be obtained, regardless of how many characters have previously been created. Upon using a card, the player is taken to the character creation screen, where they can customize their character through choosing a name, appearance, and race, among other options. When a character is first created, only limited appearances are available, but additional options become available ingame using \\"Pons\\", which can be bought from the Cash Shop. Currently there are three races: human, elf, and giant. When creating a character, one may choose an age between ten and seventeen. The character will age one year every (real) week. Different ages yield different initial stats and affect the number of stats raised when leveling up. AP (Ability Points) are also granted when aging; the younger one is, the more AP they will get when they age. Rebirth is an important feature in Mabinogi. With Rebirth, players have the option to reset the age, gender, appearance, and level of their character. Characteristics such as physical features, age, and level that were associated with the old body can be bestowed onto the new one. All the achievements earned in the character's previous body, such as skill ranks and title, will also be carried over. Players usually rebirth as a way to gain AP and accumulate more levels for their character's total level. Each (real world) day of the week grants players specific bonuses, such as getting a higher experience rate for certain skills, higher item creation success rate, aging, gaining AP, etc. =Combat system= In combat, predicting the enemy's skills and making use of combat skills is important. Some monsters are aggressive and will attack and pursue on sight (also called \\"aggroing\\"), while others attack in a pack or completely ignore the player. Unlike other MMOs, Mabinogis combat is arguably more tactical in nature - requiring careful analysis and timing of what skills to use and in what fashion. As opposed to the 'tank' roles portrayed in other online games, Mabinogis combat focuses on the player not being hit at all - through careful use of skills and precise timing. The overall complexity of Mabinogis combat system has made it much more difficult for training bots to be developed. Many are just designed to farm the significantly easier low- level monsters for in-game currency. Mabinogi features a traditional melee combat approach (utilizing various swords, maces and shields), a ranged combat approach (using various weapons such as crossbows and long-bows) and a magic or alchemic approach - all of which have their own strengths and advantages at different points of the game. Mabinogis freeform skill system allows players to hybridize between any four of the combat trees at any time - the only limitation lying with the player's overall proficiency at operating the game controls and mechanics. Dying causes loss of experience points. Before the new beginnings patch items could drop during death as well and retrieved from an NPC for gold, Items no longer drop and any items held by an NPC beforehand can still be retrieved normally. Fallen players can be revived by other players, self revive once every 3 minutes, or by the in-game NPC, Nao, if the player has bought such service. If the character has zero experience points and suffers a death penalty, negative experience points will accumulate. If the player reaches negative 100% experience, they will no longer be able to revive by themselves and must wait for another player to revive them, or use \\"Soul stones\\" purchased from the \\"Cash Shop\\" (Requires Nexon cash points, currency that can be used to buy special items that cannot be bought in-game. Nexon cash points cost real money.). =Stats= Character statistics alter the combat system by the individual qualities of a character. Statistics are split into five categories: Strength, Intelligence, Dexterity, Will, and Luck. Strength, Intelligence, and Dexterity all determine the base attack power of melee, magic, and ranged, respectively. Dexterity also determines damage balance during melee combat. Will affects how your character absorbs strong blows and how much damage is done to enemies. A character's luck rating may improve the chance of high hits, gathering, and increases the chance of lucky drops. These statistics may be raised by ranking most skills. For example, Magic Mastery, because its dealing with magic, raises a certain amount of Intelligence per rank. The raising of Life Skills is beneficial to warriors because of Strength increases in activities such as carpentry and fishing. =Fantasy Life= There is a wide range of Life skills which give the player the chance to experience a different side of the \\"fantasy life\\". Players can perform tasks such as tending to the wheat and potato fields, making flour, gathering wool from sheep and eggs from hens, weaving and making garments, mining for minerals and crafting weapons, playing and composing music, cooking dishes, taming animals, etc. Using a system called Music Markup Language (actually a variation of Music Macro Language, which is completely distinct from the notation format usually referred to as Music Markup Language), players may compose their own arrangements or use music scrolls created by other players. In the North American version, these are known as the \\"Compose\\" and \\"Play Music\\" skills. Different musical instruments, such as lutes, ukuleles, flutes, and others can be used to play. NPC interaction is important. As the player talks to different non-player characters, more dialog keywords will become available. These will reveal plot points and NPC backgrounds, unlock quests or skills, etc. NPCs also offer a variety of services such as shops, item repair and upgrade, skill apprenticeships and more. Players can also request part-time jobs from some of the NPCs, which can be completed in a quest-like fashion. There is also the creation of homesteads which allows players to have a free space to themselves where they can perform certain activities such as farming, fishing, etc. They can be customized by the building of items, such as ornaments, using homestead stones. These homesteads can be accessed once the character reaches level 10 and has completed a quest. =Quests, Exploration Quests and Part-Time Jobs= There are many different quests that players can complete throughout the game. Different types of quests exist, some are party quests, others involve monster hunting, item collecting or other tasks, for instance, skill-based quests like cooking or tailoring. Some of them are received by the player at specific points or after certain quests are completed, others are given by the NPCs, some can be purchased as quest scrolls and, finally, there are also exploration quests that the player can enroll in through the Quest Boards found throughout Erinn. Quest rewards may consist of experience points, Ability Points, gold, items or a combination of these rewards. Quests help the player to discover the game's regions and to find out about the many available NPCs, as they involve traveling to different parts of the game world and talking to all the different non-player characters. Exploration quests typically involve finding certain hidden objects using a pair of L-shaped rods or by finding landmarks or animals and making a sketch of these. Different exploration quests are available according to the player's exploration level. There is also a player rank for the completion of each quest. When a character completes exploration quests or simply comes across these hidden landmarks, the character's exploration level will increase, and as they level up, the character will gain Ability Points, and access to new exploration quests. Another type of special quests are part-time jobs, which are given by the NPCs. Part-time jobs are only available at a specific time of the day for each NPC and have a time limit to be completed. The player must complete the requested tasks (i.e.: delivering an item to another NPC, crafting a certain number of items, collecting objects, doing farming chores, etc.) and report back to the NPC to choose their reward. As the player successfully completes more jobs, NPCs will give more rewarding quests. Repeating these jobs helps to raise the intimacy level between the player and the NPC (giving certain items to the NPC may also help). When a \\"friendship\\" has been established between them, certain merchant NPCs will reveal a secret store to the player with special items to purchase. =Mainstream plots= Mabinogi also has several mainstream story campaigns. These campaigns have connected story lines (when grouped together, are called Chapters) that reveal the background story of Erinn and several important characters. There are campaigns, such as Generations 1 through 3 (Chapter 1), 7 and 8 (Chapter 2), 9 through 12 (Chapter 3), and 13 through 16 (Chapter 4) that must be completed in sequential order, each implemented at their corresponding Generation updates. =Skills= Each character can develop a large number of skills, although some can only be learned if the character is of a certain race (Human, Elf, Giant). Skills are divided into nine categories: Life, Combat, Magic, Alchemy, Fighter, Music, Puppeteer, Dual Gunner and Ninja. Life refers to crafting and performing skills, such as fishing, cooking, composing, tailoring, blacksmithing or potion making. Some of the Life skills available are also mini-games. Combat skills refer to melee and ranged attack skills, as well as defensive moves. Magic comprises three kinds of elemental magic (ice, fire and lightning) and non-elemental magic, such as healing and recovery skills. In Generation 9, Alchemy was introduced to the game world. Alchemy is used with a cylinder and a crystal, and can be used to create temporary walls, summon golems and a number of spells resembling magic (water/ice, fire/fire, wind/lightning and clay/neutral) according to the crystal used. In Generation 16, Fighter was released, introducing martial art techniques. In The Saga: Iria, Dual Gunner was introduced, and its skills regard the use of mana bullets. From The Shadows patch introduced the Ninja talent, which is enhanced by Strength and Will. Characters can also improve their life skills, which include Cooking, Tailoring, and First Aid. There are also music skills, including Playing Instrument and Composing. These skills can give players advantages to improve their battle experiences or can be used to improve their social experience within the game. Skills can be improved by advancing them to higher ranks. This is done by meeting certain requirements, usually involving the use of the skill. For most skills, it is also required to spend a number of Ability Points, which are acquired by gaining levels or aging. =Time and weather= The game has its own internal clock, with thirty-six minutes of real time corresponding to one in-game day. The sun and moon move visibly across the sky with the hours, with objects casting shadows that move accordingly, and the moon undergoes phases. A second moon, always rising and setting opposite the sun, is described as the source of magic energy, and players recharge mana faster while it is in the sky. In Erinn, the Sun is called Palala, it is said to provide energy on the world. The Red Moon is called Eweca, which generates Mana. The Blue Moon is called Ladeca. Each real time day of the week offers players the opportunity to take advantage of specific gameplay bonuses, such as increased skill success or lowered NPC store prices and also go to the other world. Weekday names used in-game reflect the Celtic mythology that the game evokes. In Mabinogi, actual days of the week represent seasons and are named for the traditional Welsh and Irish quarter days and cross-quarter days. *Imbolic (Sunday) *Alban Eiler (Monday) *Beltane (Tuesday) *Alban Heruin (Wednesday) *Lughnasadh (Thursday) *Alban Elved (Friday) *Samhain (Saturday) A dynamic weather system is also in place, with effects such as heavier or lighter cloud cover, rain, and thunder. The weather affects the outcomes of certain player skills and work done by NPCs. =Dungeons= Mabinogi uses an instanced dungeon system, with random map generation, that allows dungeon exploration by multiple players at the same time. When a player enters a dungeon, he will find a lobby with a statue of the goddess, and a platform before it. A separate dungeon instance is created for every unique type of item thrown on the platform (for dungeon passes, a unique instance is created for each instance of pass dropped). Depending on what the player drops, he might end up in a dungeon instance with players already in it. Dungeons maps consist of connecting rooms and corridors. As the player explores the map, the player will encounter chests or other devices which will, if opened or activated, summon monsters that must be defeated in order to progress in the dungeon path. At the end of each dungeon, there is a large room, which will usually have the boss enemy of the dungeon (sometimes escorted by a number of other enemies). Once the boss and its minions are defeated, a treasure room is opened, with the rewards for clearing the dungeon. The number of treasure chests inside the treasure room will be equal to the number of characters in the dungeon (at the time of dungeon creation). Players can thus explore the dungeons in teams. Some dungeons have special items called passes which allow harder (and sometimes easier) versions to be done. Some passes require a specific number of players to form the team. After Generation 9, similar dungeons called Shadow Missions and Theatre Missions were implemented. They feature the same basic mechanics, but are selectable by the player and usually take place on a large, isolated, fixed map or area instead of using a generated map. =Titles= Achieving certain conditions (collecting items, performing tasks, etc.) will reward the character with a title. These conditions can range from participating in the closed beta to completing quests. Titles, when applied to a character, can positively or negatively change the character's stats. Titles can also be applied to pets, though they have no effect on their stats. Some titles are unique in the server, with each server having only one character who holds that specific title. =Achievements= Players can also acquire achievements, which are recorded by an achievement journal, by doing numerous events like acquiring a title or completing a dungeon. =Destiny System= In Generation 13, a feature called \\"Destiny System\\" was implemented. Similar to a class system, but without any penalty or skill limitations, this system allows the player to optionally choose their specialized job and become either a Warrior, Ranger, Mage, Alchemist. Players have the chance to change or choose Destinies during every rebirth. When players specialize in a Destiny, they gain a specific stat increases to that own Destiny (e.g., Warriors gain more strength than average). In addition, they gain twice the training experience they would normally gain for the said skill (e.g., being a Warrior allows you to train Smash twice as fast), and they will not be penalized in other Destiny skills (e.g., Warriors can train and use all magic skills without limitations). =Commerce System= A trading allows players to trade items throughout various towns within Erinn for Ducats, the \\"currency\\" of the Fomors. EXP and Gold are also rewarded from Commercing as well. When Commercing, one must take consideration of the number of items being transported, the number of items the transportation method can carry, and the selling price at the target town in order to receive the maximum profit. Ducats rewarded from Commercing are separate from the Gold currency obtained in the game. Ducats allows the player to purchase various items sold by the Mercantile Imp found at each Trading Post. Items sold by the Mercantile Imp include Fomorian-variant weapons which are stronger than normal weapons, however a special stone upgrade cannot be performed on them. Occasionally, the selection may include Legendary Weapons which may yield various effects (i.e. the Legendary Weapon, Tyrfing greatly increases the weapon's damage after rendered unconscious). The currency may also be used to purchase transportation methods; starting from a Backpack to a Handcart to a Wagon or a Pack Elephant. The transportation modes increase the user's movement speed and weight and/or item slots, allowing them to carry more items. Transportation of items also increases the player's Merchant Rating for that town. A higher rating offers discounts for various items, as well as allowing one purchase more valuable goods for trading with other towns. =Other game features= Players can set up stores to sell their items. Items cannot be looted since any item dropped from a monster cannot, as a rule, be picked up by another player for an amount of time proportional to an item's value. Items can be safely traded through the trading panels. Mabinogi has a variety of in-game books. Mabinogi fetches the contents of books you read over the Web using HTTP from mabibook.nexon.net. Using a program like WireShark (with a filter like 'http contains GET') or tcpdump can capture the HTTP requests sent when you read a book in the game. Generation 3, in later updates, added housing areas between Tir Chonaill and Dunbarton in an area splitting off of Dugald Aisle, and also between Bangor and Emain Macha in an area splitting off of Sen Mag Plateau. Through this housing system, players can bid for a house and pay rent for it afterwards, in order to keep it. Houses may be used as stores, and players are able to purchase items to decorate their homes. Player characters can also get married in-game, by requesting this to a marriage NPC. A pet system is also available. Players may purchase Pet Cards from the game store and summon them in-game. Pets can help in combat or, in some cases, even be used as transportation, allowing the player to travel at a greater speed than on foot. Each pet has a fully customizable AI system, allowing the owner to give it preset actions he or she desires. Pets can even be played by players themselves. Like the player characters, pets also grow as they age. However, unlike player characters, pets automatically learn skills based on their level. Other features include the guild, party, and Player vs Player systems. Guild creation requires the purchase of an extended play package from the game store. Guilds can expand/level up by meeting an increasing quota of points (called Guild Points, or GP), which are earned by the guild's members by playing in-game. Similar to other games, the party system allows sharing of experience points between players. PvP combat is possible in special arenas, as well as between Paladins and Dark Knights at any location, as well as \\"duels\\", where characters arrange combat for each other, or their pets. As of the Pioneers of Iria release, elves and giants can also engage in full PvP combat at any location, as well as those humans aligned with elves or giants. European release On January 27, 2010, Nexon launched the Open Beta of Mabinogi Europe with two game servers: Morrighan and Macha. Along with the Open Beta release came the generation 2 expansion. It was expected that generation 3 would be released when the game enters the official phase, which will be accompanied by the opening of the cash shop. Nexon Europe eventually launched Mabinogi on May 26, 2010. A few months later, Nexon Europe released Generation 12 at the same time as North America in October 2010, a large update featuring new mainstream quests and skills. Shortly after this, Nexon Europe removed 2 of the 5 available game channels in Macha, due to a lack of players in that server. In April 2012, Nexon Europe announced its plans to shut down the European service on the 25th, (due to insufficient player-base growth and profit) and allowed its former users to play on North American servers with a new account and no character transfers if they wished to do so. Nexon America has since lifted the European IP blocks for Mabinogi. On July 13, 2012, Nexon Europe announced that it is going close the game service and customer support of Mabinogi on July 18, 2012. Reception , the game has over registers users worldwide. Franchise A prequel game for Mabinogi called Vindictus (also known as Mabinogi Heroes in Asia) was released on January 21, 2010 by devCAT, an internal studio of Korean free-to-play game publisher Nexon. It is a free-to- play action MMORPG that takes place in the same setting used in Mabinogi, but is placed chronologically several hundred years prior to the first game during a period of war and strife. Vindictus is currently released in Korea, North America, and Europe through Nexon. Mabinogi II:Arena, the sequel to Mabinogi Heroes, was in development but subsequently cancelled. It was noted to feature more realistic 3D models, animation and settings, according to development diaries and press releases made by the game developer devCat. The game was previewed at G-Star 2012. The preview content depicted characters, enemies, and dungeon crawling that are similar to the original Mabinogi, but focused more on instant action-based combat similar to the style of Vindictus with an emphasis of the more down-to-earth skill animations similar to that of Mabinogi. It was announced in January 2014 that Mabinogi II:Arena development was stopped.

As of 1967, the town had an estimated population of 12,860 and a population density of 313 persons per km2. The total area was 41.10 km2. On April 1, 1967, Akayu was merged into the expanded city of Nan'yō and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality. History The village of Akayu was established on April 1, 1889, with the establishment of the municipalities system. It was raised to town status on December 12, 1895. On June 10, 1955, the village of Nakagawa was annexed by Akayu. On March 21, 1957, the Nakayama neighborhood of Akayu was annexed by the neighboring city of Kaminoyama. On April 1, 1967, the town of Akayu merged with the town of Miyauchi and the village of Wagō to form the city of Nan'yō. =Isabella Bird= English travel writer Isabella Bird visited Akayu on her travels in Japan in 1878. In Unbeaten Tracks in Japan she wrote of Akayu: > the frequented watering-place of Akayu in the north, is a perfect garden of > Eden, 'tilled with a pencil instead of a plough,' growing in rich profusion > rice, cotton, maize, tobacco, hemp, indigo, beans, egg-plants, walnuts, > melons, cucumbers, persimmons, apricots, pomegranates; a smiling and > plenteous land, an Asiatic Arcadia, prosperous and independent, all its > bounteous acres belonging to those who cultivate them, who live under their > vines, figs, and pomegranates, free from oppression--a remarkable spectacle > under an Asiatic despotism. Local attractions Akayu is most famous for Akayu Onsen (赤湯温泉), a series of ryokan famed for their natural hot-springs which are believed to have medicinal properties. The town's name, which is literally translated as \\"red hot water\\", derives from a story in 1093. It is said that the feudal chief of Mutsu Province, Minamoto no Yoshitsuna took a wounded soldier to a hot spring bath. His blood immediately turned the water red and the wound closed. is regarded as one of the top 100 cherry blossom viewing sites in Japan, and in 2000, an estimated 25,000 people came to the town in April to enjoy hanami (\\"flower viewing\\") parties. The district also has an internationally recognised hang-gliding venue, the Sky Park, which hosted the Third Women's Hang Gliding Championships in 1993. Akayu's most famous ex-resident is Toyotarō Yūki, a former governor of the Bank of Japan, and the town has a museum devoted to his life.

The mountain is composed of a central massif with an extensive plateau above and high outlier peaks projecting from the mountain. The highest feature on the plateau is the unimposing summit of Legges Tor, at 1572 m, on the northern aspect of the plateau. The southern end of the plateau is dominated by Stacks Bluff, , which is an imposing feature that drops away to a cliffline above the surrounding foothills. The prominent outlier peaks of Ragged Jack (), Mensa Moor () and Tower Hill () surround the plateau. Ben Lomond is east of Launceston in the Ben Lomond National Park. Tasmania's premier Alpine skiing operations are located at Ben Lomond with downhill skiing facilities in the State. Its accessibility from Launceston, together with the existence of a ski village on the plateau make Ben Lomond an all year round favourite for tourists and hikers. Access to the village and summit can be made via several walking tracks or via a zig-zag road known as \\"Jacobs Ladder\\". The locality of Ben Lomond is in the local government area of Northern Midlands in the Central region of Tasmania. The locality is about east of the town of Longford.  Nomenclature  The Tasmanian Aboriginal palawa kani name for Ben Lomond is ' and was recorded in various word lists as ', toorbunna or '. The meaning of this name is uncertain, but the suffix bunna/pina is thought to denote tableland or plateau and linguistic research suggests that the stem tur/tura means bluff or precipitous cliffs. Modern etymological researchers of the Palawa lexicon assert that, in addition to ', there were several names related to Ben Lomond: *parndokenne - the plateau between the Nile River valley (Lake Youl) and Stacks Bluff * tudema tura - a name recorded by John Glover - Taylor asserts that tudema equates to the locality and tura = bluff- probably Stacks Bluff * ' - cf lienta (i.e. mangana lienta - South Esk River) a contraction for the plains to the south of Stacks Bluff - Fingal Valley * ' - another name for a bluff at Ben Lomond (cf ter=tur bluff/cliffs) Most of the Aboriginal names for Ben Lomond probably refer to Stacks Bluff or the southern division of the massif - as the toponym Ben Lomond was usually applied to the southern half of the mountain in 1800s Tasmania, when these words were recorded. The lake on the southern aspect of the plateau, now known as Lake Youl, was known to the Aboriginal people as minamata, the prefix mena/miena being the aboriginal word for lake or lagoon and the suffix mata possibly referring to the surrounding topography. This name survives on modern maps as the toponym for the small lakes on the north- western aspect of the plateau - the Menamatta Tarns. One of the few examples in Tasmania of a land feature retaining its traditional name. The South Esk River, which encircles the plateau on three sides, was known as mangana lienta, from the word ' (large stream) and lienta referring to ', that is, the Fingal valley. The river near modern day Nile was known as plipatumila Although the mountain was seen by Flinders on his circumnavigation of Tasmania, the modern name was given by Colonel Paterson, who founded the first settlement in northern Tasmania in 1804, and is taken from the eponymous Scottish mountain. There is no isolated peak named Ben Lomond but instead the name may refer to the plateau, massif, bioregion or national park in which it is situated. In colonial times 'Ben Lomond' referred to both the southern extremity of the massif and the country around the southern escarpment. The toponym does not appear cartographically in reference to the entire massif until the 1900s; when Stacks Bluff also appeared on modern maps. Features on the plateau have accreted names over the last two centuries as the region has opened up to surveyors and official parties. The prominent peaks were renamed promptly by European settlers and most were based on appearance or location, with Stacks Bluff (originally 'the Butts', then 'the Stacks'), Ossians Throne (originally 'The Knuckle'), the Buffaloes (rock formations near Denison Crag) and Ragged Jack (originally Ragged Mountain) appearing in correspondence in the 1800s. Features on the plateau were predominantly named after surveyors (Giblin Fells), Government Administrators (Twelvetrees Moor), local identities Lake Youl (John Youl (clergyman)) or contemporary explorers (Grant Cirque). The Government Surveyor John Helder Wedge made several visits to the plateau and renamed minamata 'Lake Glover' - after John Glover - and named modern day Tranquil Tarn as 'Pigeon's Well'; - after \\"Pigeon (Beewurher)\\" - John Batman's mainland Aboriginal guide; all of whom accompanied Wedge on his first expedition to the plateau. Wedge also records an unknown feature (possibly Lake Baker, the next largest water feature on the plateau) as 'Lake Maikai' - the provenance of this name is unknown. Last to be named is Mensa Moor, which was approved by the state Nomenclature Board in the 1990s.  Natural history of the mountain  Geology = The basement rocks comprise slates, siltstones, greywackes and quartzite. These were intruded by granite and, later, by dolerite during the Jurassic Period. Dolerite predominates on the plateau. The only exception is a highly localised area under Coalmine Crag and around the flanks of the Ben Lomond Plateau. This exposure includes a narrow coal sequence, which was once worked commercially. During the Pleistocene Ice Age, a small ice-cap existed on Ben Lomond, which was the only plateau in the north-east to be glaciated. The effects of these glaciers account for much of the contrast between the alpine scenery of Ben Lomond and that of the other mountains in the north-east. The most notable relict periglacial depositional features are the blockfields, which cover over a quarter of the Ben Lomond plateau. Much of the plateau is devoid of soils. Organic soils (peats), including deep peats, are most extensively developed on the western side of Rodway Valley. Mineral soils are also found, particularly in the better drained sites. Jurassic dolerite on western escarpment = Flora = Ben Lomond National Park protects a representative cross-section of Tasmania's north-east alpine plant communities. Although much of the plateau is stony with areas of low and often stunted forms of vegetation, the remainder of the mountain contains a wide variety of habitats ranging from alpine moorland to dense forest. A total of 222 plant species have been recorded on the Ben Lomond plateau, represented by 152 dicotyledons, 62 monocotyledons, 1 gymnosperm and 7 fern and fern ally families. The five most common families (Asteraceae, Poaceae, Epacridaceae, Cyperaceae and Proteaceae) account for about half the total number of species recorded. Most families, however, are only represented by one or two species. Some introduced plants have naturalised on the plateau from introduced grasses, clovers and straw used to stabilise soil and revegetate areas affected by slope grooming, road works and other site disturbances. The most common native species recorded on the plateau are the herbs Poa gunnii (tussock grass) and Gentianella diemensis, the shrubs, Richea scoparia, Orites acicularis and Pentachondra pumila, Baeckea gunniana and Epacris serpyllifolia. Cushion plants are abundant throughout the plateau. One species, the rock cushion plant Chionohebe ciliolata, is known only from a small localised area within the Park. Other rare and threatened species include the rare endemic Oreomyrrhis sessiliflora, and the endangered Colobanthus curtisiae. = Fauna = Of the larger mammals, Bennett's wallabies and wombats are common, and are regularly seen in the ski village during summer and winter, even under blizzard conditions. Pademelons are abundant in the wet gullies and areas with thick undergrowth. Forester kangaroos have been recorded along the south-west edge of the park. Eastern quolls inhabit the ski village during winter, and are sometimes sighted during daylight hours. Dusky antechinus occasionally visit lodges. The echidna has been recorded and the platypus has been sighted in the Upper Ford River. Various other species, including the long-nosed potoroo, Tasmanian bettong, brushtail possum, ringtail possum, sugar glider, native rodents such as the velvet-furred rat and the long-tailed mouse, and six species of bat have all been recorded in the park. Among the birds, no systematic study has been made. Wedge-tailed eagles are regularly reported, as is the noisy yellow-tailed black cockatoo. Among the endemic species recorded are the green rosella, scrubtit, brown thornbill, yellow wattlebird, yellow-throated honeyeater, black-headed honeyeater, strong-billed honeyeater and the black currawong. Little is known of the reptiles from Ben Lomond. Of particular interest is the endemic northern snow skink Niveoscincus greeni which is an alpine species restricted to several other mountain top areas in the State. Amphibians recorded from Ben Lomond include the brown tree frog, common eastern froglet and the endemic Tasmanian froglet. Lake Youl (palawa kani: minamata) on summit of Ben Lomond HistoryAboriginal land-owners of Ben Lomond= The original inhabitants of the area were the people of the Ben Lomond Nation, which consisted of at least three clans totalling 150–200 people. Three clan names are known but their locations are somewhat conjectural - the clans were recorded as Plangermaireener, Plindermairhemener and Tonenerweenerlarmenne. The Plangermaireener clan is recorded as variously inhabiting the south-east aspect of the Ben Lomond region and also has been associated with the coastal tribes to the south-east. This clan was likely to have occupied the region of the modern day Fingal Valley to the St Mary's Plains and east coast region. 'Plangermaireener' is also used as a blanket term for all the members of the Ben Lomond Nation which reflects the suffix , recorded as meaning 'people' or 'tribe'. The Plindermairhemener clan is associated with the south and south- western aspects of the region and are likely to have occupied the South Esk Valley from the Avoca region up to at least the Nile River. Their country was bordered by the South Esk River to the south and west. The location of the Tonenerweenerlarmenne is uncertain but were probably centred in the remaining Ben Lomond Nation territory from White Hills to the headwaters of the North and South-Esk rivers or the upper South-Esk Valley. This notwithstanding, the Palawa were a nomadic people and likely occupied their clan lands seasonally. The clans of the Ben Lomond Nation hunted along the valleys of the South Esk and North Esk rivers, their tributaries and the highlands to the northeast; as well as making forays to the plateau in summer. There are records of aboriginal huts or dwellings around the foothills of Stacks Bluff and around the headwaters of the South Esk River near modern day Mathinna. There are also signs of regular occupation of the plateau by the Plangermaireener; artifacts such as stone tools are found about the low dunes at the eastern aspect of Lake Youl and in colonial times soldiers pursuing the Plangermaireener noted the 'native track' up onto the plateau from the foothills and remarked at the extensive evidence of summer occupation - with remains of firing seen about the plateau. Moreover, the remains of Aboriginal quarry works under Coalmine Crag suggest that the plateau was used for sustained periods by the Plangermaireener, as stone tools were needed for dressing game.  The Colonial Period  The clans of the Ben Lomond Nation were displaced in the early 1800s by extensive colonial occupation up the South Esk river and its tributaries. This particularly manifested along the mountain's western and northern boundaries, which lay closest to the settled areas of Launceston and Norfolk Plains (now Longford). Initial contact between the Ben Lomond people and British colonials was likely to have been on hunting grounds around the South or North Esk, as early in settlement hunting parties from Launceston made incursions into the plains south of the nascent city. First contact may well have been peaceable as convict hunters and aboriginal people traded kangaroos and hunting dogs early in the colony's history.Boyce, James (2008). Van Diemen's land. Melbourne: Black Inc. . Into the 1820s free land grants to wealthy settlers displaced convict hunters and led to the establishment of pastoralism at the Ben Lomond frontier, particularly up the Nile and Esk Rivers. The presence of farms and stockmen interrupted the migratory tribal life of the Aborigines and, although initial relations were peaceable, displacement was accelerated by continuing intrusion into country, abduction of aboriginal women and violent conflict with both settlers and with rival tribes. In particular, women became scarce due to the abduction by sealers of women in coastal areas, consequently leading to internecine raids for women across the interior. In 1825 two convicts assigned to Andrew Barclay and James Cox on the Nile River, near Deddington, were killed and mutilated by Ben Lomond clanspeople in a dispute over women and ownership of hunting dogs. An aboriginal witness, Temina, testified that one man was killed by spearing and that a woman belonging to his people 'crushed his head with stones'.'. This was the first recorded of many violent encounters between the Plangermaireener and European settlers. Children, also, were a target for abduction by settlers. For example, the prominent settler James Cox, at Clarendon on the Nile River, raised the Aboriginal William 'Black Bill' Ponsonby from a child. Over time, the aboriginal people were forced into an ever more marginal existence and; with numbers depleted by disease, murder and abduction, were forced into sustained conflict with occupying settlers. In 1829 these remnants of the Ben Lomond nation allied with members of the North Midland nation in order to conduct guerilla style raids on remote stock huts: \\"The black natives have again commenced their outrages in this district. About six weeks back they speared a shepherd belonging to Mr. Dark (near Deddington), in sight of that gentlemen’s house... About a week after that they robbed Mr. Bonney’s (at modern day Bonney's Plains near - Stacks Bluff ) stock hut of blankets, flour, sugar, etc. Three days after they pursued a shepherd of Mr. Massey’s (near Deddington); the same day they threw a spear at Mr. Sinclair’s shepherd; the spear passed over the man’s shoulder and through a ewe about two rods before him, which the man was driving. The man escaped by running from them. Last Saturday, week they speared and beat with their waddies a man of Mr. Reed’s, near the same spot. Yesterday they attacked a servant of Mr Sevoir's (of Sevoir gully, near Nile Bridge), whom they endeavoured to surround ; the man saved his life by discharging his musket two or three times, and retreating every time until he got to his hut where other men were\\" These attacks continued on huts and farms along the Ben Lomond frontier into 1829, with a war party plundering a stock hut belonging to John Batman in July and in the next month spearing of assigned men at Lord's property, killing a stonemason in his employ. As hostilities escalated across Tasmania in the Black War the colonial government authorised the employment of Roving Parties (essentially armed bounty hunters) to conciliate the remaining free aboriginal tribesmen. In September 1829, a party led by John Batman, with the assistance of two mainland aboriginal men he had brought to Tasmania, and the Tasmanian Aborigine 'Black Bill' Ponsonby, led an attack on an Aboriginal family group together numbering 60–70 men, women and children in the mountain's south east foothills. Waiting until 11pm that night before attacking - 'killing or wounding 15'. This must have proven to be a devastating setback to an increasingly desperate remnant of the Plangermaireener as they were scarcely seen on the Ben Lomond frontier from that time. Remnant Plangermaireener women were subsequently found in the Piper River region and reported lethal internecine conflict between the Ben Lomond people and a confederation of Oyster Bay and Big River clansmen - resulting in the death of all but 6 of the Plangermairreener men.The Tasmanian., Hobart Town, Tas. 18 Aug 1830. In winter 1830 the Ben Lomond people were noted to be absent from their traditional wintering grounds on the East Coast and never again would family groups be seen collecting eggs and fish from the lagoons at Oyster Bay. The latter half of 1830 saw an increase in frontier violence as the Black War reached its nadir. During the spring of 1830 an Aboriginal party was noted to have crossed the Midlands from the 'Westward' to the Ben Lomond frontierThe Hobart Town Courier (Tas.) 11 Sep 1830. and, within a fortnight, John Batman reported in a dispatch that a marauding party of clansmen were raiding up the South Esk Valley. The raiding party attacked several remote settler and stockman's huts from Oyster Bay to Avoca - alongside their traditional hunting and travelling route on the Ben Lomond frontier. Their aim appeared to be both robbery and revenge and during their raids they killed 5 assigned men and wounded several others severely, reportedly only being prevented from killing an entire family by the presence of soldiers. However, by late 1830, remnants of the Aboriginal clans were living a precarious existence on the edge of the frontier, harried by alert colonial settlers and militia and denied access to their hunting grounds. As the infamous 'Black Line' military operation was being disbanded elsewhere in Tasmania, George Augustus Robinson spent a week in north-east Tasmania searching without success for the Ben Lomond people. By this time, Robinson considered that the Plangermaireener were reduced to just 10 individuals. In December, 1830, Robinson had relocated 33 Tasmanian Aboriginals to nearby Swan Island and he subsequently sent a party searching throughout the Northeast looking for the remnants of the Ben Lomond, and north-eastern peoples, without success. Attacks on colonials decreased after the military action of the Black Line but in early 1831 three assigned men of Thomas Massey were wounded by Aboriginal clansmen near modern day Deddington and this is the last reported conflict between settlers and Aboriginal clansmen at the Ben Lomond frontier.The Hobart Town Courier (Tas.). 26 Mar 1831, page 2. = The fate of the Ben Lomond people = After the failure of the 'Black Line' in 1830, and after pressure from settlers, Colonial Governor George Arthur announced on 14 March 1831 his new policy of the removal of Aborigines from Tasmania. The conciliator George Augustus Robinson was tasked with rounding up the remnant aboriginal people. Robinson \\"....gave an unequivocal commitment that if hostilities ceased, Aborigines would be protected and have their essential needs met by the government while being able to live and hunt within their own districts.\\" These concessions, combined with the promised return of their women from the sealers, were the terms under which the chief Mannalargenna joined Robinson's embassy. Mannalargenna was either a Plangermaireener or Oyster Bay Chief (or perhaps a leader of a confederation of the two Nations) - an Aboriginal leader who had organised guerrilla attacks against British forces in Tasmania during the Black War. Mannarlargenna has been praised for attempting to preserve the remnants of his people with his bargain or treaty with Arthur and Robinson. It would ultimately lead to the end of hostilities with the Aboriginal people, although at the expense of exile, as the remnant aboriginal people were moved en masse to Wybalenna ('Black Man's Houses' in the Ben Lomond Nation language) on Flinder's Island - where Mannarlargenna died of pneumonia. At Wybalenna the remnant of the Ben Lomond people were encamped with aboriginal people from other, often rival, nations. The process of cultural assimilation began here, with compulsory attendance at Christian services mandated. At Wybalenna aboriginal people continued their resistance to oppression: Walter George Arthur; the son of Rolepana, a Ben Lomond Nation elder became the first Australian Aboriginal activist when he petitioned Queen Victoria in 1846 in protest at the treatment of his people. The aboriginal people fared poorly at Wybalenna and then when relocated to Oyster Cove, with disease and malnutrition contributing to high mortality and low birth rates. The Ben Lomond Nation ceased to exist as a political and cultural entity after the occupation of their country and the subsequent murder, abduction or exile of its people. When the last people of that nation died at Oyster Cove on the Derwent much of the history that had persisted for generations died with them. The Palawa did not die out- descendants of the 'tyreelore', Palawa women taken as wives by sealers in Bass Strait, continued to live in a prosperous community on Flinders and Cape Barren Islands. Many of these descendants have cultural and genetic lineage from the Ben Lomond Nation and with the chief Mannarlargenna, in particular.  Modern history  Exploration in Colonial times = The first European to ascend the mountain was likely to have been John Batman, who is recorded to have crossed the plateau in his forays against the Ben Lomond Nation. In 1829, with a party of soldiers, he ascended the plateau from the foothills, noting the 'native track' onto the summit and the extensive firing of the plateau by the Plangermaireener from their regular summer occupation. The artist John Glover ascended the mountain with John Batman in the 1833 accompanied by the surveyor John Wedge and Batman's mainland aboriginal servants. Glover made sketches that clearly show the bluffs on the south-eastern escarpment, views of Lake Youl and the view of Tranquil Tarn from the eastern face. Although no paintings of the ascent have survived there was at least one painting exhibited in 1835 that portrayed the summit of Ben Lomond. = Surveying the mountain = The first scientific visit to the Ben Lomond plateau was made by the Polish explorer Paul Edmond de Strzelecki on 28 November 1841 and he measured the height of Stacks Bluff (albeit incorrectly) by barometry as 5002 feet. In 1852; after the site was surveyed by James Sprent, the Government Surveyor, a Trigonometric Point was constructed on Stacks Bluff (the southernmost extremity of Ben Lomond) using convict labour. A Full survey of Ben Lomond was conducted from September 1905 to 1912 by Colonel W.V. Legge and, later, Lyndhurst Giblin took over the survey. The surveyors climbed to the plateau from Mangana but on some of the later visits they ascended via Avoca and the Ben Lomond Marshes. The nomenclature of features on the mountain were established at this time and were named after members of the survey party and famous explorers of the period. The survey party explored the highlands on the north of the plateau in 1907. Legge had long suspected that the north of the plateau was higher than the trigonometric station on Stacks Bluff (called by him Ben Lomond Fell or Bluff) but was less obviously elevated. Moreover, the area was, at the time, an area so remote and unexplored that Legge described it as 'untrodden as the distant ranges of the west coast'. Lyndhurst Giblin climbed and measured the true summit and named it after Legge. and, in turn, the prominent bluff to the south of the summit was named for Giblin's father - Giblin Fells. = Mining = Gold  In 1854 exploratory parties seeking gold, and sponsored by the Colonial Government, explored the plateau of Ben Lomond, driving bores and claiming to find 'particles of gold' But it was alluvial gold, below the summit, that proved payable and was mined to the east of Ben Lomond at Tower Hill, Mathinna and Mangana from 1855 until the 1940s. At its peak Mathinna had a population of 2000 but this dwindled after mining ceased. Tin and tungsten were the other minerals to be obtained in the southern foothills of Ben Lomond and the townships of Rossarden and Storys Creek arose from the 1920s to 1957 around these mines.  Coal  In 1829 coal was found by John Batman and a party of British soldiers pursuing the Plangermaireener onto the plateau and they collected some to be successfully burnt on descending the plateau. Later there was a mine on the plateau, at Coalmine Crag, from which some coal had been extracted for local use in the ski village and, possibly, by trappers. It is not known whether the Aboriginal inhabitants of the region used this coal for burning or decoration but there is an indigenous word for coal (conara) and the seams are exposed and easily accessible in the vicinity of Raffertys Creek and Coalmine Crag. Coal was found in commercial quantities at the head of the Ben Lomond Rivulet in 1857 but the seam was mined at the Stanhope Mine, situated on Buffalo Brook about halfway between Stacks Bluff and Avoca. = Mining exploration = Mining interests also existed on the north-west of the mountain, around the island peak of Ragged Jack, where the prospect of silver and tin was investigated, but they proved to be economically unviable. = Aquaculture = Loch Leven trout fry were released into Lake Youl in 1905 in an attempt to establish recreational fishing on the mountain. Recent survey of fauna on the mountain shows no evidence of fish in Lake Youl. = Proclamation as National Park = Proposals for Ben Lomond to be made a scenic reserve were made as early as 1910 - as a reaction to frequent fires on the plateau. Ben Lomond was declared a National Park and Scenic Reserve in July 1947. The park encompassed nearly 40,000 acres of land that had previously been declared a fauna reserve although land already set aside for the Forestry Commission was excluded from the park. = Recreation on Ben Lomond = Recreational walking tracks onto the mountain  Legges Tor from the summit looking towards the Ben Lomond Ski Resort. Ben Lomond snowfields. Jacob's ladder single lane access road to Mount Ben Lomond in Tasmania Australia Recreational walking on and around the plateau was established from at least the mid 1830s, usually for the purpose of summiting Stacks Bluff, but it was not until the 1880s, when the mines had brought large numbers into the area, that walking on the plateau became popular. At this time the principal track to the plateau lay across the Ben Lomond Marshes ascending the western side of Stacks Bluff. This track led from Avoca, up Castle Cary Rivulet to the Ben Lomond Marshes, to the plateau on the western side of Stacks Bluff and along the headwaters of the Ben Lomond Rivulet. The track was describes as passing up the 'Ploughed Fields' (the scree slope below Stacks Bluff) and proceeding through a pass between Wilmot Bluff and the western cliff line called by locals 'The Gap'.'Ben Lomond'. The Examiner (Tas).06 Jan 1922. Avoca, being located on the Fingal train line from Launceston, was the staging point for excursions to the mountain, with local guides arranging packhorses, camping equipment and suitable campsites below the plateau.Avoca and Ben Lomond. The Mercury (Tasmania). 28 Mar 1895The Examiner (Launceston). 'Beautiful Tasmania'. 13 May 1893. A track from Mangana was created in the early 20th century for the purposes of attracting walking tourists onto the plateau. The summit was '9 miles from Mangana', led up the eastern escarpment and was used later by Legge for his survey of the mountain.The Daily Telegraph (Launceston) 13 Nov 1906 This track passed by a hut below the plateau (complete with stables) and was regarded as an easy ascent to the plateau Another steep track existed from Storys Creek which is still used to ascend via Tranquil Tarn to the summit of Stack's Bluff. The western face of Ben Lomond was accessed from English Town and this track took a course round the northern slopes of Ragged Jack. This is the original route for access for skiers before the northern route was established from Carr Villa hut. Early 20th-century ski access track Excursions in the 1880s became popular enough for a landowner to build a two- storey hotel with 12 rooms, a store, bakehouse and stables at the northern end of the Ben Lomond Marshes for the use of excursionists and miners.Daily Telegraph (Launceston). A Christmas Trip to Ben Lomond. 10 Feb 1900 This was the 'Ben Lomond Hotel', which was built in 1883, and was a popular staging point for the walk up to the plateau, but by 1908 the hotel had been abandoned and fallen into disrepair. The Ben Lomond Hotel continued to be used as a staging hut for guided excursions up to the plateau from Avoca into the 20th century.Daily Telegraph (Launceston). A Christmas Trip to Ben Lomond. 10 Feb 1900. Today, formed tracks exist that access the plateau from the northern, northeastern and south-eastern aspects of the massif. The northern access track is from the Scout hut at Carr Villa, in the northern foothills, to the summit (following the snow pole line of the old ski track) and thence to the ski village. The island peak Ragged Jack has established walking and climbing routes that are accessed via the north west foothills. The southern access is from Storys Creek, past Tranquil Tarn, to the northern slopes of Stacks Bluff. A track leads up to the summit cairn of Stacks Bluff, which affords extensive views of the entire eastern half of Tasmania. The plateau is relatively open walking but no other marked tracks exist, although guide books describe access to various features on the plateau. Clive French, from the Launceston Walking Club, skating on Lake Youl c. 1950 Skiing The Northern Tasmanian Alpine Club formed in 1929 and pioneered trips to the mountain and improved the access track. In July 1929 Fred Smithies, a pioneer of skiing on Ben Lomond, accompanied the Tasmanian government's Tourism Director on a field trip to the plateau with the aim of establishing the feasibility of a skifield. Their route was by way of English Town, Ragged Jack and the headwaters of River O'Plain Creek (see image). This route had the disadvantage that it involved an extended walk to get onto the plateau but was less steep than the alternative access from Blessington. The northern route was subsequently selected after a suitable route was found through the help of a local farmer, beginning from the Upper Blessington road at Wattle Corner. In 1932, a chalet was built under the northern escarpment, facilitating access to the summit ski slopes. This chalet was named 'Carr Villa' - named from a sign taken from the Carr Villa cemetery tram stop in Launceston - humorously celebrating a Mr Carr, a member of the ski club. The first permanent summit hut was constructed 4 years later to allow skiers to overnight on the summit. A smaller hut was constructed at the head of the pass to the plateau for the purposes of shelter and storage of ski gear. The remains of this hut can be seen from the walking track as it crests the pass into the Borrowdale Valley. Access to Carr Villa, at 900m elevation, was by foot until a road was constructed in 1959 but then the summit was still a 500m ascent on foot from this point. Carr Villa chalet is now operated by the Rover Scouts after it was donated by NTAC in 1963 and the skiers access track is part of the Legges Tor circuit walking track. In 1950 a Parliamentary Standing Committee recommended that Ben Lomond be developed as a ski resort. The Australian National Championships were held at the site in 1955. In 1963 the access road was extended to the top of the plateau via the steep and scenic \\"Jacobs Ladder\\". Subsequent developments have included new ski lifts, visitor facilities, a licensed inn and accommodation, sewerage system, and improved access. The Ben Lomond Skifield Management Authority was formed in 1995 to manage the Skifield Development Area. Today, Tasmania's premier Alpine skiing operations are located at Ben Lomond, from Launceston. Located in the Ben Lomond National Park, the village is at and the top elevation is . A number of club lodges provide accommodation and the mountain has fine views which stretch to the ocean. In 2010, the Department of Parks and Wildlife released a plan for the Ben Lomond ski area recommending snow making machines, the enhancement of snow play areas and the development of a possible snow board park.  Cycling  Jacobs Ladder has been made notorious as the steep training ground for Tour de France cyclist Richie Porte and is featured as a cycling destination in itself. Mountain-bikers enjoy the fire trails around the mountain, commercial downhill rides down Jacobs Ladder and a multisport event in the vicinity. Geography The locality has an area of , almost all of which is occupied by the Ben Lomond National Park. Road infrastructure The C432 route (Ben Lomond Road) enters from the north-west and runs south-east to a skiing village, where it ends.

It forms the white matter core of the cingulate gyrus, following it from the subcallosal gyrus of the frontal lobe beneath the rostrum of corpus callosum to the parahippocampal gyrus and uncus of the temporal lobe.J. Edward Bruni, Donald Montemurro, Human Neuroanatomy: A Text, Brain Atlas and Laboratory Dissection Guide, Oxford University Press, 2009 Neurons of the cingulum receive afferent fibers from the parts of the thalamus that are associated with the spinothalamic tract. This, in addition to the fact that the cingulum is a central structure in learning to correct mistakes, indicates that the cingulum is involved in appraisal of pain and reinforcement of behavior that reduces it.Per Brodal: The Central Nervous System Cingulotomy, the surgical severing of the anterior cingulum, is a form of psychosurgery used to treat depression and OCD. The cingulum was one of the earliest identified brain structures. Anatomy and function The cingulum is described from various brain images as a C shaped structure within the brain that wraps around the frontal lobe to the temporal lobe right above the corpus callosum. It is located beneath the cingulate gyrus within the medial surface of the brain therefore encircling the entire brain. There are two primary parts of the cingulate cortex: the posterior cingulate cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. The anterior is linked to emotion, especially apathy and depression. Here function and structure changes are related meaning any change within this structure would lead to a function change, particularly behavioral because of its function involving emotions. Damage to this area can have various effects on mental disorders and mental health. The posterior section is more related to cognitive functions. This can include attention, visual and spatial skills, working memory and general memory. Because of its location, the cingulum is very important to brain structure connectivity and the integration of information that it receives.Jared Tanner Ph.D.: An overview of and introduction to the cingulum, 2010 Relation to cognitive impairment In recent years the cingulum has been associated with various brain disorders and diseases. One such area of interest is the disruption of white matter in the posterior cingulum causing mild cognitive impairment. Using diffusion MRI techniques, researchers have associated mild cognitive impairment with damage to the cingulum. The cingulum is a frontal association tract that could play a critical role because it connects sites repeatedly implicated in cognitive control. The middle segment of the cingulum contains connections with premotor and motor cortical areas. Another place of importance that explains the cingulum and its relation to mild cognitive impairment is the fact that the cingulum connects to the hippocampus. The cingulum takes memory information and integrates this to other parts of the brain. Damage to the cingulum also simultaneously damages the hippocampus. This is vital because the hippocampus is pivotal in memory storage. Damage to gray matter, bodies of neurons, or white matter of axons in the cingulum therefore can affect humans cognitively because of this damage. Also variations in microstructure of a group of fibers in the rostral cingulum have been shown to be extremely sensitive to performance of cognitive control tasks. White matter pathology of the cingulum represents one of the earliest changes in development of age-related dementia and is currently aiding researchers worldwide to discover more about this relationship.

It was founded by Mark Robinson (of Unrest) in 1984 at Wakefield High School, along with Phil Krauth (of Unrest), Andrew (Riley) Beaujon (of Eggs), Tim Moran (of Unrest), and Ian Zack (Thirsty Boys). History In 1984, when Mark Robinson was in high school, he started the label as a kind of lending library. Only one copy of each album existed and his classmates could borrow one for a few days. The albums were mostly unedited rehearsals of Robinson's band Unrest.http://killrockstars.com/thefutureofwhat/episode-96-spotlight-on-teen- beat-records/ They were not numbered but lettered (A, B, C, etc.). Only one of these early albums is known to still exist: Unrest's This Side, Numskull; catalogue number \\"J\\" (the 10th TeenBeat release); dated December 14, 1984. The first public release was a compilation cassette called Extremism In the Defense of Liberty is No Vice on February 23, 1985. This was catalog number \\"TeenBeat 1\\". This audiocassette was dubbed into multiple copies by Andrew (Riley) Beaujon and Mark Robinson, by hooking up two separate cassette machines. Robinson's original intention was to release music from the local area, inspired by Dischord Records. Before the label had any distribution deal Robinson would leave a few cassettes at records stores when he visited different cities. Style As with its influence Factory Records, Teen Beat prominently numbered its releases, with some releases known only by catalog number (e.g., the TEENBEAT 100 compilation, 1993); numbers have also been assigned to non-musical items, including T-shirts, coffee mugs, events, its offices, and interns. List of Teen-Beat bands Teen Beat (or \\"Teen-Beat\\" or \\"Teenbeat\\") has been home to a number of prominent indie bands, including Unrest, +/-, Versus, Gastr del Sol, Eggs, Aden, True Love Always and a large number of other bands and side projects. Along with Dischord Records, TeenBeat was an important early independent label; while Dischord focused on punk and hardcore, TeenBeat's bands were more typically guitar-based \\"indie-pop\\".

An odd number of negative signs makes an unbalanced triangle, according to Fritz Heider's theory. In the area of graph theory in mathematics, a signed graph is a graph in which each edge has a positive or negative sign. A signed graph is balanced if the product of edge signs around every cycle is positive. Three fundamental questions about a signed graph are: Is it balanced? What is the largest size of a balanced edge set in it? What is the smallest number of vertices that must be deleted to make it balanced? The first question is easy to solve quickly; the second and third are computationally intractable (technically, they are NP-hard). The name \\"signed graph\\" and the notion of balance appeared first in a mathematical paper of Frank Harary in 1953. Dénes Kőnig had already studied equivalent notions in 1936 under a different terminology but without recognizing the relevance of the sign group. At the Center for Group Dynamics at the University of Michigan, Dorwin Cartwright and Harary generalized Fritz Heider's psychological theory of balance in triangles of sentiments to a psychological theory of balance in signed graphs.Cartwright, D. and Harary, F. (1956)Structural balance: a generalization of Heider's theory, Psychological Review 63: 277-293; link from Stanford UniversitySteven Strogatz (2010) The enemy of my enemy, The New York Times, February 14, 2010 Signed graphs have been rediscovered many times because they come up naturally in many unrelated areas.. For instance, they enable one to describe and analyze the geometry of subsets of the classical root systems. They appear in topological graph theory and group theory. They are a natural context for questions about odd and even cycles in graphs. They appear in computing the ground state energy in the non-ferromagnetic Ising model; for this one needs to find a largest balanced edge set in Σ. They have been applied to data classification in correlation clustering. Examples * The complete signed graph on n vertices with loops, denoted by ±Kno, has every possible positive and negative edge including negative loops, but no positive loops. Its edges correspond to the roots of the root system Cn; the column of an edge in the incidence matrix (see below) is the vector representing the root. * The complete signed graph with half-edges, ±Kn', is ±Kn with a half- edge at every vertex. Its edges correspond to the roots of the root system Bn, half-edges corresponding to the unit basis vectors. * The complete signed link graph, ±Kn, is the same but without loops. Its edges correspond to the roots of the root system Dn. * An all-positive signed graph has only positive edges. If the underlying graph is G, the all-positive signing is written +G. * An all-negative signed graph has only negative edges. It is balanced if and only if it is bipartite because a circle is positive if and only if it has even length. An all-negative graph with underlying graph G is written −G. * A signed complete graph has as underlying graph G the ordinary complete graph Kn. It may have any signs. Signed complete graphs are equivalent to two- graphs, which are of value in finite group theory. A two-graph can be defined as the class of vertex sets of negative triangles (having an odd number of negative edges) in a signed complete graph. Adjacency matrix The adjacency matrix of a signed graph Σ on n vertices is an n × n matrix A(Σ). It has a row and column for each vertex. The entry avw in row v and column w is the number of positive vw edges minus the number of negative vw edges. On the diagonal, avv = 0 if there are no loops or half-edges; the correct definition when such edges exist depends on the circumstances. Orientation A signed graph is oriented when each end of each edge is given a direction, so that in a positive edge the ends are both directed from one endpoint to the other, and in a negative edge either both ends are directed outward, to their own vertices, or both are directed inward, away from their vertices. Thus, an oriented signed graph is the same as a bidirected graph. (It is very different from a signed digraph.) Incidence matrix An incidence matrix of a signed graph with n vertices and m edges is an n × m matrix, with a row for each vertex and a column for each edge. It is obtained by orienting the signed graph in any way. Then its entry ηij is +1 if edge j is oriented into vertex i, −1 if edge j is oriented out of vertex i, and 0 if vertex i and edge j are not incident. This rule applies to a link, whose column will have two nonzero entries with absolute value 1, a half-edge, whose column has a single nonzero entry +1 or −1, and a loose edge, whose column has only zeroes. The column of a loop, however, is all zero if the loop is positive, and if the loop is negative it has entry ±2 in the row corresponding to its incident vertex. Any two incidence matrices are related by negating some subset of the columns. Thus, for most purposes it makes no difference which orientation we use to define the incidence matrix, and we may speak of the incidence matrix of Σ without worrying about exactly which one it is. Negating a row of the incidence matrix corresponds to switching the corresponding vertex. Switching Switching a vertex in Σ means negating the signs of all the edges incident to that vertex. Switching a set of vertices means negating all the edges that have one end in that set and one end in the complementary set. Switching a series of vertices, once each, is the same as switching the whole set at once. Switching of signed graphs (signed switching) is generalized from Seidel (1976), where it was applied to graphs (graph switching), in a way that is equivalent to switching of signed complete graphs. Switching equivalence means that two graphs are related by switching, and an equivalence class of signed graphs under switching is called a switching class. Sometimes these terms are applied to equivalence of signed graphs under the combination of switching and isomorphism, especially when the graphs are unlabeled; but to distinguish the two concepts the combined equivalence may be called switching isomorphism and an equivalence class under switching isomorphism may be called a switching isomorphism class. Switching a set of vertices affects the adjacency matrix by negating the rows and columns of the switched vertices. It affects the incidence matrix by negating the rows of the switched vertices. Fundamental theorem The sign of a path is the product of the signs of its edges. Thus a path is positive only if there are an even number of negative edges in it (where zero is even). In the mathematical balance theory of Frank Harary, a signed graph is balanced when every cycle is positive. He proves that a signed graph is balanced when (1) for every pair of nodes, all paths between them have the same sign, or (2) the graph partitions into a pair of subgraphs, each consisting of positive edges, but connected by negative edges.Dorwin Cartwright & Frank Harary (1979) \\"Balance and clusterability: An overview\\", pages 25 to 50 in Perspectives in Social Network Research, editors: Paul W. Holland & Samuel Leinhardt, Academic Press The theorem was published by Harary in 1953. It generalizes the theorem that an ordinary (unsigned) graph is bipartite if and only if every cycle has even length. A simple proof uses the method of switching. To prove Harary's theorem, one shows by induction that Σ can be switched to be all positive if and only if it is balanced. A weaker theorem, but with a simpler proof, is that if every 3-cycle in a signed complete graph is positive, then the graph is balanced. For the proof, pick an arbitrary node n and place it and all those nodes that are linked to n by a positive edge in one group, called A, and all those linked to n by a negative edge in the other, called B. Since this is a complete graph, every two nodes in A must be friends and every two nodes in B must be friends, otherwise there would be a 3-cycle which was unbalanced. (Since this is a complete graph, any one negative edge would cause an unbalanced 3-cycle.) Likewise, all negative edges must go between the two groups.Luis Von Ahn Science of the Web Lecture 3 p. 28 Frustration Give each vertex a value of +1 or −1; we call this a state of Σ. An edge is called satisfied if it is positive and both endpoints have the same value, or it is negative and the endpoints have opposite values. An edge that is not satisfied is called frustrated. The smallest number of frustrated edges over all states is called the frustration index (or line index of balance) of Σ. Finding the frustration index is an NP-hard problem. Aref et al. suggest binary programming models that are capable of computing the frustration index of graphs with up to 105 edges in a reasonable time. One can see the NP-hard complexity by observing that the frustration index of an all-negative signed graph is equivalent to the maximum cut problem in graph theory, which is NP-hard. The reason for the equivalence is that the frustration index equals the smallest number of edges whose negation (or, equivalently, deletion; a theorem of Harary) makes Σ balanced. (This can be proved easily by switching.) The frustration index is important in a model of spin glasses, the mixed Ising model. In this model, the signed graph is fixed. A state consists of giving a \\"spin\\", either \\"up\\" or \\"down\\", to each vertex. We think of spin up as +1 and spin down as −1\\\\. Thus, each state has a number of frustrated edges. The energy of a state is larger when it has more frustrated edges, so a ground state is a state with the fewest frustrated energy. Thus, to find the ground state energy of Σ one has to find the frustration index. Matroid theory There are two matroids associated with a signed graph, called the signed-graphic matroid (also called the frame matroid or sometimes bias matroid) and the lift matroid, both of which generalize the cycle matroid of a graph. They are special cases of the same matroids of a biased graph. The frame matroid (or signed-graphic matroid) M(G) has for its ground set the edge set E.. Erratum. Discrete Applied Mathematics, 5 (1983), 248 An edge set is independent if each component contains either no circles or just one circle, which is negative. (In matroid theory a half-edge acts exactly like a negative loop.) A circuit of the matroid is either a positive circle, or a pair of negative circles together with a connecting simple path, such that the two circles are either disjoint (then the connecting path has one end in common with each circle and is otherwise disjoint from both) or share just a single common vertex (in this case the connecting path is that single vertex). The rank of an edge set S is n − b, where n is the number of vertices of G and b is the number of balanced components of S, counting isolated vertices as balanced components. This matroid is the column matroid of the incidence matrix of the signed graph. That is why it describes the linear dependencies of the roots of a classical root system. The extended lift matroid L0(G) has for its ground set the set E0 the union of edge set E with an extra point, which we denote e0. The lift matroid L(G) is the extended lift matroid restricted to E. The extra point acts exactly like a negative loop, so we describe only the lift matroid. An edge set is independent if it contains either no circles or just one circle, which is negative. (This is the same rule that is applied separately to each component in the signed-graphic matroid.) A matroid circuit is either a positive circle or a pair of negative circles that are either disjoint or have just a common vertex. The rank of an edge set S is n − c + ε, where c is the number of components of S, counting isolated vertices, and ε is 0 if S is balanced and 1 if it is not. Other kinds of \\"signed graph\\" Sometimes the signs are taken to be +1 and −1\\\\. This is only a difference of notation, if the signs are still multiplied around a circle and the sign of the product is the important thing. However, there are two other ways of treating the edge labels that do not fit into signed graph theory. The term signed graph is applied occasionally to graphs in which each edge has a weight, w(e) = +1 or −1\\\\. These are not the same kind of signed graph; they are weighted graphs with a restricted weight set. The difference is that weights are added, not multiplied. The problems and methods are completely different. The name is also applied to graphs in which the signs function as colors on the edges. The significance of the color is that it determines various weights applied to the edge, and not that its sign is intrinsically significant. This is the case in knot theory, where the only significance of the signs is that they can be interchanged by the two-element group, but there is no intrinsic difference between positive and negative. The matroid of a sign-colored graph is the cycle matroid of the underlying graph; it is not the frame or lift matroid of the signed graph. The sign labels, instead of changing the matroid, become signs on the elements of the matroid. In this article we discuss only signed graph theory in the strict sense. For sign-colored graphs see colored matroids. =Signed digraph= A signed digraph is a directed graph with signed arcs. Signed digraphs are far more complicated than signed graphs, because only the signs of directed cycles are significant. For instance, there are several definitions of balance, each of which is hard to characterize, in strong contrast with the situation for signed undirected graphs. Signed digraphs should not be confused with oriented signed graphs. The latter are bidirected graphs, not directed graphs (except in the trivial case of all positive signs). Coloring As with unsigned graphs, there is a notion of signed graph coloring. Where a coloring of a graph is a mapping from the vertex set to the natural numbers, a coloring of a signed graph is a mapping from the vertex set to the integers. The constraints on proper colorings come from the edges of the signed graph. The integers assigned to two vertices must be distinct if they are connected by a positive edge. The labels on adjacent vertices must not be additive inverses if the vertices are connected by a negative edge. There can be no proper coloring of a signed graph with a positive loop. When restricting the vertex labels to the set of integers with magnitude at most a natural number k, the set of proper colorings of a signed graph is finite. The relation between the number of such proper colorings and k is a polynomial in k. This is analogous to the chromatic polynomial of unsigned graphs. ApplicationsSocial psychology= In social psychology, signed graphs have been used to model social situations, with positive edges representing friendships and negative edges enmities between nodes, which represent people. Then, for example, a positive 3-cycle is either three mutual friends, or two friends with a common enemy; while a negative 3-cycle is either three mutual enemies, or two enemies who share a mutual friend. According to balance theory, positive cycles are balanced and supposed to be stable social situations, whereas negative cycles are unbalanced and supposed to be unstable. According to the theory, in the case of three mutual enemies, this is because sharing a common enemy is likely to cause two of the enemies to become friends. In the case of two enemies sharing a friend, the shared friend is likely to choose one over the other and turn one of his or her friendships into an enemy. Antal, Krapivsky and Reder consider social dynamics as the change in sign on an edge of a signed graph.T. Antal, P.L. Krapivsky & S. Redner (2006) Social Balance on Networks: The Dynamics of Friendship and Enmity The social relations with previous friends of a divorcing couple are used to illustrate the evolution of a signed graph in society. Another illustration describes the changing international alliances between European powers in the decades before the First World War. They consider local triad dynamics and constrained triad dynamics, where in the latter case a relationship change is made only when the total number of unbalanced triads is reduced. The simulation presumed a complete graph with random relations having a random unbalanced triad selected for transformation. The evolution of the signed graph with N nodes under this process is studied and simulated to describe the stationary density of friendly links. Balance theory has been severely challenged, especially in its application to large systems, on the theoretical ground that friendly relations tie a society together, while a society divided into two camps of enemies would be highly unstable.B. Anderson, in Perspectives on Social Network Research, ed. P.W. Holland and S. Leinhardt. New York: Academic Press, 1979. Experimental studies have also provided only weak confirmation of the predictions of structural balance theory. =Spin glasses= In physics, signed graphs are a natural context for the general, nonferromagnetic Ising model, which is applied to the study of spin glasses. =Complex systems= trophic system Using an analytic method initially developed in population biology and ecology, but now used a similar notion in many scientific disciplines, analysis of the properties of signed digraphs has found application in applied formal causal reasoning about the behavior of complex causal systems.Puccia, Charles J. and Levins, Richard (1986). Qualitative Modeling of Complex Systems: An Introduction to Loop Analysis and Time Averaging. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA. Such analyses answer questions about feedback at given levels of the system, and about the direction of variable response given a perturbation to a system at one or more points, variable correlations given such perturbations, the distribution of variance across the system, and the sensitivity or insensitivity of particular variables to system perturbations. =Data clustering= Correlation clustering looks for natural clustering of data by similarity. The data points are represented as the vertices of a graph, with a positive edge joining similar items and a negative edge joining dissimilar items. Generalizations A signed graph is a special kind of gain graph, where the gain group has order 2. The pair (G, B(Σ)) determined by a signed graph Σ is a special kind of biased graph.

Written by Drew Z. Greenberg, and directed by Michael Grossman, the episode originally aired on November 8, 2002. The episode sees Malcolm Reynolds forced to choose which crew members to save when one is gravely wounded and two others are kidnapped. Simon Tam finds an uneasy haven in a remote village, but River's uncanny perceptions jeopardize the Tams' temporary safety. The episode is noteworthy for being the television debut of actor Zac Efron, who appears in flashback as the young Simon Tam.  Plot  The episode is interspersed with flashbacks, detailing Simon and River's lives before River's abduction: Simon, a studious young boy, River engaging in flights of imagination while correcting his textbooks, and their father encouraging Simon to become a \\"brilliant doctor\\". These expectations are derailed when River is sent to an elite, though secretive, academy. Simon does not hear from her in a while, then becomes concerned when she sends him a letter referring to events which never happened. Their parents are untroubled by River's letter, believing she is just playing games again. Simon, however, believes it to be a coded message asking for help. His father bails out Simon once when he tries to rescue her, but warns his son he will not do it a second time. In the present day, Simon continues to try to diagnose River's condition and injuries, while Mal demands that they stay out of the way while he conducts business. On arrival at the backwater colony of Jiangyin, Shepherd Book aids Mal and Jayne in unloading and penning the cattle and meeting with the Grange brothers, their disreputable buyers. Just as they come to an agreement on price, local law enforcement arrives to arrest the clients, and Book is seriously wounded in the ensuing gunfight. Meanwhile, Simon and River join Inara and Kaylee in town as the women are shopping. Although Kaylee contemplates buying something nice for Simon, the doctor manages to insult her and her beloved Serenity with his complaints about his predicament, and the Tams are left to their own devices. Simon quickly discovers River has wandered off. She finds a maypole dance, and Simon watches his sister enjoy herself for a change. River's ecstatic dancing suddenly falters when Book is shot, but before Simon can react to his sister's distress, he is kidnapped by some men. River follows and is seized as well. Mal and Zoe manage to get Book back to Serenity to stabilize him. When Wash is unable to find Simon to help Book, Mal realizes that Simon and River have probably been taken by local hill folk who kidnap unwary people, especially skilled workers. He makes the decision to abandon the Tams in order to seek urgently needed medical help off-planet. On Inara's insistence, they dock with the Alliance cruiser Magellan; its captain refuses to help until Book tells them to check his identification card, at which point the captain orders immediate assistance. Mal and the rest of the crew wonder what kind of connection with the Alliance Book has to receive such treatment, but a recovering Book dodges Mal's questions, stating merely that \\"it's good to be home.\\" The hill folk welcome Simon and his sister. When Simon sees the many sick villagers, he sets to work. Doralee, the village teacher who runs the infirmary, merely suggests that Simon may well be in the place he is fated to be. Simon and River share a memory of their childhood, and River despairs of how her plight has taken everything Simon had away from him. When River tells Doralee about the cause of a young mute girl's silence, Doralee realizes that River has an unusual power, but assumes this means that River is a witch and must therefore be burnt at the stake. Simon appeals to the villagers, but when these efforts fail, he instead takes his place next to his sister, prepared to die with her. At this moment, Serenity swoops over the village, Jayne dangling from its hold with a large weapon at the ready, while Mal and Zoe stride in and rescue the Tams. As Serenity leaves Jiangyin, Simon asks Mal why he came back for them, and Mal explains off-handedly that Simon is part of his crew. \\"But you don't even like me,\\" Simon reminds him. \\"Why'd you do it?\\" \\"You're on my crew,\\" Mal repeats. \\"Why are we still talking about this?\\"  Guest cast  * Isabella Hofmann and William Converse-Roberts as Regan and Gabriel Tam, the mother and father of Simon and River Tam. * John Thaddeus as Stark, the bandit who kidnaps Simon and River. * Gary Werntz as Patron, the leader of the township the Tams are brought to. * Zac Efron as young Simon Tam.

Inara attends a formal society dance, only to find Malcolm there as well, attempting to set up a smuggling job. Mal comes to blows with Inara's conceited date and finds himself facing a duel with a renowned swordsman, and only one night to learn how to fence. Synopsis The crew lands on Persephone. In her shuttle quarters, Inara scans potential clients and chooses local aristocrat Atherton Wing, a regular customer. Mal and Jayne are accosted by Badger, who needs Mal's help to move an illegal cargo for high-society local Warrick Harrow, who will not talk to the likes of Badger. He provides Mal and Kaylee with tickets to the very ball that Inara will be attending. At the ball, Atherton asks Inara to be his personal Companion, remaining in a world more suited to her, but she diplomatically defers a decision. Suddenly, the arrival of \\"Miss Kaywinnet Lee Frye and escort\\" is announced—Kaylee, in a ruffled dress she had earlier coveted in a shop window, accompanied by Mal. Back on Serenity, Simon, Book, and Jayne play a card game, using ship chores as currency. River, experiencing another of her manic outbursts, frantically shreds the Blue Sun labels of their canned food supplies. Meanwhile, Wash and Zoe have sex. At the ball, Kaylee's friendly attempt to mix with the debutantes fails, but she is rescued by an older gentleman, then drawn to a group of several mechanically-minded men. Meanwhile, Mal finds Sir Warrick, who is cool to any proposal that Badger is behind, despite Mal's professionalism. Just then, Atherton Wing, with Inara in tow, interrupts their conversation. Mal escorts Inara onto the dance floor, but when Atherton cuts in and insists on his right to take Inara away because \\"money changed hands\\", Mal punches him in the face, unknowingly making a challenge that commits him to a duel by sword against expert swordsman Atherton. Sir Warrick agrees to be his second. On Serenity, Badger arrives uninvited to explain to the remaining crew that Mal will be participating in a duel. As the crew discusses how to rescue him, Badger disabuses them of this idea — he is here with his men to sit on them until the duel is finished. As Mal ineptly practices for the duel, Inara sneaks into his room to talk; she is confused by Mal's decision to punch Atherton because he insulted her, when Mal often does this himself. Mal replies that he merely insults her profession, whereas Wing insulted her. In the meantime, the crew of Serenity sits in the cargo hold, attempting to plot an escape from the watchful eyes of Badger and his cronies. Jayne comes up with the idea that they need a diversion. River appears and, in a display of her as-yet unrevealed talents, converses with Badger in his own accent, mentioning his heretofore unknown past. River departs, leaving a confounded but amused Badger. Jayne realizes that River's distraction of Badger is exactly what the crew could've used. In the duel, Atherton wounds Mal several times through tricky swordplay, and when he has Mal at his mercy, turns at a plea from Inara, who offers to stay with him if he will only spare Mal's life. Mal uses his distraction to disarm the swordsman, deliver a punch to the face, and throw his own broken sword blade at him, stabbing him in the shoulder. Mal stands over the wounded Wing, wielding Wing's own sword, and Sir Warrick demands that he deliver the final blow, lest Atherton be humiliated. Mal, however, shows mercy (after getting in two more pokes). As Inara helps Mal off the field, Atherton calls out viciously to Inara and threatens to ruin her. Inara responds by informing him that he is now persona non grata in the Companion registry, implicitly ruining him. Entertained by Mal's trouncing of the conceited Wing, and impressed by his tenacity, Sir Warrick agrees to send his cargo with Mal. The as-yet- unbegun escape plan plotted by the Serenity crew is aborted by the return of Inara and Mal, who chases a pleased Badger off his ship. Inara and Mal share a moment on the cargo bay landing, watching over their cargo from Harrow — a bay full of cattle. Production The writer of this episode, Jane Espenson, revealed how she enjoyed writing this episode, as it gave her a chance to invent a card game, as well as write dialog in \\"Jane Austen style\\".Espenson, ed., Finding Serenity, 2 The sword fight took place near a Disney-owned production facility and so the shots had to be framed to exclude the \\"Country Bear Jamboree\\" barn located in the background. According to DVD commentary, the role of Badger was originally written to be played by Joss Whedon. Instead the role was given to Mark Sheppard. The ballgown that Inara wears at the ball was actually made out of costume designer Shawna Trpcic's wedding dress. The T-shirt that Jayne wears during the episode contains the Chinese word yong (勇), which means \\"soldier\\" or more commonly \\"brave\\". This shirt also appears in the episodes \\"The Train Job\\", \\"Ariel\\", and \\"War Stories\\".

After Serenity is underway again, Mal encounters a stowaway in the cargo bay. The young woman, Saffron, informs him that she is his wife. Shepherd Book reads up on the local customs and informs Mal that he had inadvertently taken part in the local marriage ritual by accepting a wreath of flowers, drinking her wine, and dancing together. Mal has a heart-to-heart talk with the woman. Despite Mal's encouragement to be her own woman, Saffron cooks him a meal and offers to wash his feet. Jayne attempts to trade his favorite gun, \\"Vera\\", for Saffron, but Mal turns him down. When Mal enters his quarters later, Saffron manages to kiss him. However, her lips are covered with a narcotic which renders him unconscious. Saffron heads to the cockpit and tries her wiles on Wash. When she is unsuccessful, Saffron knocks him out with a kick to the back of the head. She quickly takes control of the ship, setting it on a mysterious course and sabotaging the controls, then welding the door shut behind her as she leaves. Running to a shuttle to escape, she meets Inara and tries to seduce her too. Inara plays along to buy time, but the alarm goes off. Inara compliments Saffron on her skillful lying. After dodging a kick from Saffron, Inara rushes to Mal after Saffron claims that she is Malcolm Reynolds' widow. After Inara finds him only unconscious, she kisses him, then collapses after calling for help, another victim of Saffron's drug. After breaking into the bridge, Kaylee and Wash are able to restore only the navigational system. They are headed straight for a \\"net\\". Book explains that the net will probably electrocute everyone inside, leaving the ship to the net's operators. Mal has Jayne shoot a crucial part of the net with Vera, shorting it out. Jayne also ruptures the window of the net's control compartment, ejecting the two men inside into space. Later, on a snowy world, Mal bursts into Saffron's cabin and, after an unsuccessful attempt to get some answers, knocks her unconscious. Back on Serenity, Mal presses Inara for an explanation of her supposed dizziness. Inara thinks Mal knows about the kiss and agrees to \\"not play\\" with him, but Mal reveals he thinks she kissed Saffron.  Deleted scene  River confounds the crew with one of her seeming whimsies, this time demanding that Book marry her and Simon. When Simon tries to explain that they can't get married because they are siblings, River gets very upset and questions his love for her. Mal and Saffron then come in and River accuses Saffron of being a thief, though River says she never saw Saffron stealing food. This indicates River's knowledge of Saffron's true nature, though at this point Saffron is still playing the subservient wife. After they leave, River takes a pillow from nearby and puts it in her dress at the stomach, stating that she and Simon have to get married now: \\"I'm in the family way.\\" Joss Whedon said on the DVD commentary that this was one of his, the cast's and the crew's favorite scenes, but they had to edit it out due to time constraints. Because this scene was cut, River has no lines in this episode.  Production details  According to Jayne, \\"Vera\\" needs oxygen around her to fire; however, real-world gunpowder incorporates both fuel and oxidizer and will combust regardless of the presence or absence of atmosphere. According to the DVD commentary, the episode's producers checked this with a gun expert, but were incorrectly informed. It is possible that the limitation deals more with the action of the rifle, because some metals normally made to work in an atmosphere will vacuum weld together with no air present. It's also possible that the fictional, 26th century Vera used a propellant or particular ammunition type unlike any real-world 21st century gun, that does indeed require oxygen. Vera herself is a rather extensively modified Saiga-12 semi- automatic shotgun. The episode's title, \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds,\\" is a play on the 1952 radio show, Our Miss Brooks.

Returning to a moon where he ran into some serious trouble years ago, Jayne discovers that he's become a local folk legend. Mal decides to use this entertaining distraction to complete a job, but some unfinished business may derail his plans.  Plot  The episode opens with Kaylee insisting that the always-proper Simon never uses swear words, despite his protestations that he does whenever they're \\"appropriate\\". Inara departs for an overnight meeting with a client. Jayne attempts to use tape to smuggle a concealed weapon on the mission, against planetary regulations, apparently afraid he will be recognized for crimes committed some years back, but Mal orders him to leave the gun behind. The crew arrive at the town of Canton, disguised as buyers of \\"mud\\", a clay which can be processed to produce a ceramic described as \\"ten times stronger than steel\\". Jayne is fearful, as years before he robbed the local magistrate. After talking with the foreman, they enter the town, where they find a statue of the \\"Hero of Canton\\", Jayne himself, to Jayne's shock and puzzlement. A local folk song reveals that Jayne is viewed as a Robin Hood. During the botched robbery, Jayne reveals the true story, which is that he was forced to jettison the money to lighten his getaway vehicle, a stolen hovercraft, after it was hit. The loot apparently rained down on the impoverished \\"mudders\\" of Canton. Jayne is recognized and finds himself idolized by the locals. Mal's smuggling contact is horrified by how the crew seems to be \\"lying low\\", but Mal decides to use this distraction to sneak the contraband through town undetected. Inara meets with the magistrate, who introduces her to his 26-year-old son Fess. Fess is still a virgin, so the magistrate has hired Inara to \\"make a man of him\\". She reassures Fess that there is nothing wrong with his being a virgin and that he should be himself and not his father. On the ship, an agitated River dismantles Shepard Book's Bible, insisting that it makes no sense and that she has to \\"fix\\" it. Book manages to calm her down and explains that the Bible is not about making sense in a logical or scientific sense, but rather about faith that fixes people rather than needing fixing itself. Later, she attempts to repair and return it to him, but panics when she sees his wild head of hair (per the rule of his order) that he normally keeps in a tight bun. When the foreman informs the magistrate that Jayne Cobb has returned, the magistrate releases a man named \\"Stitch\\" from what appears to have been four years of solitary confinement in a very small cell. He gives the puzzled man a loaded shotgun and then tells him that Jayne is back. Inara completes her task and prepares to return to the ship. When Fess expresses puzzlement at not feeling different, she explains to him that being a man is about being old enough to ask what makes him a man rather than about sex. Somewhat later, Inara learns from Fess that Jayne is about to be captured and tried, and that the ship has been \\"land-locked\\". He tells her that he would rather Jayne escape. Mal returns to fetch Kaylee and Simon, finding the mechanic draped over him on a couch. He tries to explain to Mal how \\"nothing happened\\", but once again manages to accidentally insult the frustrated Kaylee. Collecting a tipsy Jayne, they head off, but Kaylee stops Simon in his tracks with her scorn. As the doctor eats breakfast alone, Stitch arrives. The scarred criminal brutalizes him in an attempt to locate Jayne, but the roars of an approving crowd outside give away his location instead. Stitch drags Simon along as a hostage to confront Jayne. Stitch tells the Canton mudders that Jayne and he stole the money, and that when they found themselves needing to reduce weight, Jayne threw him overboard, and then the safe with the money. Stitch then shoots, but a mudder jumps in front of Jayne and is killed. Jayne kills Stitch, but cannot understand why the young man sacrificed himself even after having learned the truth of Jayne's \\"heroism\\". When the crew boards Serenity, Wash attempts to take off, but finds the ship \\"land-locked\\" per the magistrate's order. It is quickly released, however, as Fess decides to prove himself a man by defying his father's attempt to capture the \\"Hero of Canton\\". Kaylee has a heart-to-heart talk with Simon but cannot resist briefly making him worry about what happened after the previous night's party. In the cargo bay, Jayne broods about the mudder's sacrifice and how the townsfolk will probably put the statue back up. Mal attempts to explain to Jayne the hero worship is not about him, but about what the townsfolk need, but Jayne only replies: \\"Don't make no sense.\\"  Guest cast  * Gregory Itzin as Magistrate Higgins * Daniel Bess as the young mudder who sacrifices himself for Jayne. * Kevin Gage as Stitch Hessian * Zachary Kranzler as Fess Higgins  References Bibliography    External links   \\"Jaynestown\\" at Firefly Wiki Category:2002 American television episodes Category:Firefly (TV series) episodes ","title":"Jaynestown"},{"id":"2472630","text":"The Hawker Hunter Tower Bridge incident occurred on 5 April 1968 when Royal Air Force (RAF) Hawker Hunter pilot Alan Pollock performed unauthorised low flying over several London landmarks and then flew through the span of Tower Bridge on the Thames. His actions were to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the RAF and as a demonstration against the Ministry of Defence for not recognising it. Upon landing he was arrested and later invalided out of the RAF on medical grounds, which avoided a court martial. Background In the 1960s, the British defence industry saw a shifting emphasis from manned aircraft towards guided missiles, originating from the 1957 Defence White Paper by British Defence Minister Duncan Sandys. The British aircraft industry had slipped into general decline and morale in the aerial services of the British armed forces was low. Flight Lieutenant Alan Pollock, a flight commander in No. 1 (Fighter) Squadron RAF, was further displeased that no aerial displays had been planned to mark the RAF's 50th anniversary. On 1 April 1968, Pollock and other members of No. 1 Squadron took part in anniversary leaflet raids on other RAF stations and on 4 April visited RAF Tangmere, where they performed a display. Incident Tower Bridge On 5 April 1968, Pollock decided on his own initiative to mark the occasion of the RAF anniversary with an unauthorised display. His flight left the soon-to-be- closed RAF Tangmere in Sussex to return to RAF West Raynham in Norfolk, a route that took them over London. Immediately after takeoff, Pollock left the flight and flew low level.James Hamilton-Paterson, Empire of the Clouds: When Britain's Aircraft Ruled the World, London: Faber and Faber, 2010, pp. 344-50\\\\. . Having \\"beaten up\\" Dunsfold Aerodrome (Hawker's home airfield), he then took his Hawker Hunter FGA.9 (XF442), a single-seater, ground-attack jet fighter, over London at low level, and circled the Houses of Parliament three times as a demonstration against Prime Minister Harold Wilson's government. Pollock continued and dipped his wings over the Royal Air Force Memorial on the Embankment, and finally flew under the top span of Tower Bridge. He later wrote of the decision to fly through Tower Bridge: Knowing that he was likely to be stripped of his flying status as a result of this display, he proceeded to \\"beat up\\" several airfields (Wattisham, Lakenheath and Marham) in inverted flight at an altitude of about 200 feet en route to his base at RAF West Raynham, where, within the hour, he was formally arrested by Flying Officer Roger Gilpin. Although other pilots had flown under the upper span of Tower Bridge, Pollock was the first to do so in a jet aircraft. Aftermath In the immediate aftermath of the incident his unit was posted to North Africa without him while he remained on a charge. He was subsequently invalided out of the RAF on medical grounds. This avoided a court martial and the embarrassment to the government of Pollock giving a reason for his stunt and perhaps receiving the support of the public. The RAF placed Pollock in a \\"psychiatric hold\\" for two days. Demonstrations of support for Pollock's conduct was expressed by BOAC (British Overseas Airways Corporation) which sent him a keg of beer and six members of the House of Commons spoke on Pollard's behalf in Parliament. In 1982, the Royal Air Force officially exonerated Pollock for his demonstration flight celebrating the 50th anniversary of the RAF.https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/story-royal-air- force-pilot-who-scared-everyone-flying-close-national-landmarks-london NotesFootnotesReferences * McLelland, Tim. \\"The Hawker Hunter\\".

Hard up for cash, the crew of the Serenity takes on a job from Simon: break into an Alliance hospital on the central world Ariel so Simon can perform a thorough diagnostic of River and the crew can loot the valuable stores of medicine. But River's pursuers are hot on their trail, and they receive some unexpected inside help. Plot summary Serenity heads to Ariel, a central world of the Union of Allied Planets, where Inara is due for her annual Companion physical exam and license renewal. Following an incident in which River attacks him, Jayne demands that she and Simon be left on Ariel. Mal quashes any talk of leaving people behind, but privately warns Simon that River has to be kept under control. Simon acknowledges that his sister is getting worse. Simon approaches the crew with a job: he wants to get into the hospital in Ariel's capital city in order to scan River's brain with an advanced piece of medical equipment, and he needs the crew to get him inside. As payment, he will tell the crew how to steal valuable medical supplies undetected (they will be replaced automatically by hospital machines). Simon drugs himself and River so they appear dead, allowing the crew to enter Ariel city's hospital using a scrapped medical shuttle they refurbish and fake EMT IDs. The group then split up, with Jayne guarding Simon as he analyses River's condition while Mal and Zoe steal drugs from the hospital. However, Jayne betrays the Tams, placing a call to an Alliance officer who agrees to pay their bounty. Once awakened, Simon dresses as a doctor and takes River to the diagnostic ward with Jayne. There, Simon discovers that River's brain has been surgically operated on many times, disabling her ability to suppress emotions. With the analysis complete, Jayne leads them to a rear entrance, where they are arrested by Federal marshals, Jayne included, the Alliance officer deciding to keep the reward money for himself. Meanwhile, Mal and Zoe return to the medical shuttle with the loot, but realize that Jayne and the Tams are late so head back into the hospital to find them. The three prisoners are moved to a holding area where Jayne and Simon overpower their escorts and escape. Shortly afterwards, two blue-gloved men arrive to take custody of the Tams, using a mysterious sonic device to kill all the marshals when the pair learn that some of them talked to the Tams. Meanwhile, a terrified River leads Jayne and Simon to a locked door, which is opened from the other side by Mal and Zoe, enabling the group to escape. Inara returns to Serenity just as the medical shuttle arrives. Once everyone else has left the cargo area, Mal knocks Jayne out. Jayne awakens to find himself in an open airlock as the ship begins to leave the atmosphere. Jayne eventually confesses that he betrayed Simon and River, but denies double crossing Mal. Mal tells him that what he did was the same as betraying him. As Mal turns to leave, Jayne asks him not to tell his shipmates about the betrayal. Mal closes the outer door, sparing Jayne's life. Production Dr. Tam, Jayne, Kaylee, and Malcolm after their raid of an Alliance hospital. Malcolm's hugging Kaylee was improvised by Nathan Fillion. The medical shuttle that appears in the episode and is used to ferry the main characters back and forth from St. Lucy's is built from a 2/3 scale model of a Soviet Mil Mi-24 Hind D helicopter. A group of fans have bought the scrapped medical shuttle (from a scrapyard in Mojave, California), and are in the process of restoring it, hoping to show it on the Firefly convention circuit. When the crew returns to Serenity after their successful raid of the Alliance hospital, Malcolm grabs Kaylee from behind and pulls her into a friendly hug. This was improvised by Nathan Fillion, and was left in the shot because Joss Whedon felt it was such a natural movement for Malcolm to make.

It differs stylistically from the rest of the series, in that it tells its story alternately in three timeframes: events in the present, events in the near-past that led to the present, and events in the past that led to the formation of Serenity's core crew. After Serenity suffers a catastrophe that leaves her crew with only hours of oxygen, flashbacks show how Mal and Zoe acquired Serenity and assembled their motley crew.  Synopsis  While deep in space, the ship's compression coil blows out, disabling the engine and critically injuring Zoe. With the engine offline, the main life support system has no power, and the backup was disabled by the explosion or ensuing fire. With only a few hours of oxygen left, Mal orders the crew to divide into two groups and head off in opposite directions in the shuttles, while he stays behind with the ship in case someone picks up their distress signal. Hours later, another ship does indeed show up. Mal bargains with the captain for a new catalyzer, but the man shoots Mal and decides to commandeer Serenity for himself. Mal turns the tables by grabbing a nearby gun when the hostile crew's backs are turned, successfully driving them off his ship. Bleeding from a stomach wound and on the verge of passing out, Mal manages to get the new catalyzer installed and restarts the engine. He then staggers up to the bridge, but falls unconscious before he can recall the shuttles. He wakes up in the infirmary, surrounded by the rest of the crew while Wash gives him a blood transfusion. A supine but conscious Zoe welcomes him back. She reveals that she ordered the crew to return to Serenity when she regained consciousness, thereby saving all their lives. Spread throughout the episode, a sequence of flashbacks shows the assembly of the crew. Flashbacks are intercut with the two more recent timelines based on spatial relationships, contrasting past events in certain areas of the ship with current ones. First, Mal convinces his fellow former soldier, Zoe, to join him on his new ship Serenity. The next two to join the crew are Hoban Washburne, an accomplished pilot who bothers Zoe for some unexplained reason, and a laid-back mechanic named Bester. On a layover for repairs, Bester brings a young woman to the engine room for some sex; this woman, Kaylee Frye, soon replaces him as engineer when she shows an instinctive rapport with the ship's engines. The next recruit is Inara Serra, who uses her high status as a Companion to bargain for a 25% discount on the rent for a shuttle. She also insists that Mal never call her a \\"whore\\" again (a promise he frequently breaks). Next is Jayne Cobb. He and others have Mal and Zoe at gunpoint, but Mal offers him a better deal and Jayne switches sides. The episode closes with a final flashback, showing Mal seeing Serenity for the first time, while a salesman is trying to sell him a different ship.  Production  According to the DVD commentary, Alan Tudyk took the big red \\"recall\\" button from the Firefly set and presented it to Joss Whedon, telling him that if Whedon managed to get the series renewed, he could press it to call the cast back. Also according to the commentary, Gina Torres (Zoe) was written out of the bulk of the episode because the filming took place just after her marriage to Laurence Fishburne and they were away on their honeymoon. Tim Minear credits David Solomon's expertise as a director with the success of the episode's daring three-timeline structure. In order to distinguish between the three timeframes and clarify events for the audience, the three timeframes were shot using drastically different lighting: * Flashbacks that take place in the distant past are lit with warm, dark tones; yellows, reds, golds, but all with a lot of shadow, shaded and blurred lines, and dark areas. * Scenes that take place in the present and/or near-past (depending on perspective) are shown with relatively normal lighting, bright, with vivid color. * Scenes that are shown in the present and/or near future (again, depending on perspective) are lit with a blue/purple tint, oblique light-sources, and extremely sharp lines and contrast. Furthermore, the differences between the second two timeframes (not including the flashbacks) become more subtle as the storyline goes on, as the story catches up with itself, the 'present' becomes the past and the 'future' becomes the present.

The name \\"Euphoria\\", is a term used in Psychiatry to describe a feeling one gets in the state of Mania, was decided upon by Palash, who at the time was a student of medicine at the University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi. Euphoria has released 7 studio albums and are one of India's highest-selling artists and the highest-selling band ever. They have released 16 singles by adopting the DIY method, and embracing the digital revolution in the music industry. They were inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2012 by the Indian Recording Arts Academy at the Palm Expo in Mumbai. Early years and the first album Dhoom (1988–1999) Euphoria was formed in 1988 by a then medical student Dr. Palash Sen and his friends. Bass player Debajyoti Bhaduri joined hands with Palash in the early nineties. Moving through several line-ups, the band kept searching for their elusive break. It came 10 years after their inception when Euphoria released their first studio album titled 'Dhoom' in the October 1998 to critical acclaim and commercial success. They became the pioneers of 'Hind Rock' or rock music in Hindi. Their first single was titled 'Dhoom Pichuk Dhoom' – and it became the most popular video to hit TV screens in that decade. Directed by ad-guru and filmmaker Pradeep Sarkar, the video became a benchmark for non-Bollywood music videos. Two other videos were shot and released for the songs \\"Tum\\" and \\" Sha Na Na\\" the same year. During this time the band even included the legendary Gussy Rikh, whose musical dexterity helped improve the band's often one-dimensional sound. Influences Initially rooted in English rock the band through its various line-up changes, found its calling in the sound of fusion rock music arrangements with Hindi lyrics and melodies. With the release of their debut album “Dhoom” in 1998, Euphoria was the first indigenous band that became a household name. Phir Dhoom and Mantra (1999–2002) After the success of 'Dhoom', Euphoria started work on their second studio album 'Phir Dhoom' and delivered hit singles such as 'Phir Dhoom', 'Rok Sako To Rok Lo', and 'Pyar Hi Tha'. But it was their first single 'Maaeri' (an instrumental launching the career of Rimi Sen) which became their most successful song and their trademark tune. It was during the recording of this album, that Palash asked Tabla Player Prashant Trivedi and Percussionist Rakesh Bhardwaj to join the band. Two back-to-back hit records had already cemented Euphoria as a powerful musical force. The band toured heavily this time, to promote the record and also played at the prestigious Beale Street Music Festival in Memphis in 2000. In 2001, Euphoria became the first ever band to play inside the United Nations General Assembly along with Junoon from Pakistan. After returning to the country, the band released \\"Mantra\\", India's first ever standalone single release, independent of an album. ‘Mantra' established their unique hind rock resonance which was an eclectic mixture of Indian and global sounds. It was during this time that front man Palash shot for the film Filhaal, which was released the same year. Gully (2003–2006) Changes Mehfuz, REDhoom, Best of Luck and Line Up Change (2006–2010) In 2006, the band's fourth studio album 'Mehfuz' surprised critics and fans alike. The new sound and the maturity in the songwriting won a lot of hearts and made Euphoria the only force in Indian music which could commercially take on Bollywood. Four music videos were released for the songs 'Soneya', 'Mehfuz', 'Bewafaa', and 'Rab Jaane'. Mehfuz was the first album that the band recorded in their newly made studio \\"The Clinic\\". The band's current drummer, Ashwani Verma, joined the band during this time. In 2008, the band completed 10 years of their recording career and released 'Re Dhoom'a commemorative compilation album consisting of 12 of Euphoria's biggest hits with a music video of the song 'Bhoola Sab'. Following personal differences and misunderstandings, Palash asked the then guitarist and keyboardist Hitesh Madan and Benjamine Pinto to leave the band. During a brief hiatus that the band took from playing live, Euphoria created music for the Malayalam Film \\"Best of Luck\\" released in late 2010. Indian Guitar Legend Kalyan Baruah played guitars on the songs. Kalyan also appeared live with Euphoria on 2 occasions, and later also guested on their 2011 MTV Unplugged appearance. Axeman Amborish Saikia and Keyboard player Vinayak Gupta completed Euphoria's line up and brought about a total change in Euphoria's sound with their cutting edge nu age musicianship. Euphoria was sounding younger, better and more aggressive than ever. Item (2011) In 2011, the band released their fifth studio album titled \\"Item\\" and embarked on a 10 city tour of USA to promote it. Euphoria also made an appearance on MTV Unplugged's Indian edition the same year and performed \\"ITEM\\" and \\"C U Later\\" from the new album, along with their other hits. In the first week of May, Euphoria released the second single \\"C U Later\\" from Item in two languages, Hindi and English. A music video to support the promotions was also created in both languages, making it India's first bilingual single. The single went on to peak at number 5 on VH1 India's Top Ten charts. Item was released worldwide by Universal Music India. Sharnaagat (2012 Onwards) Euphoria launched their 6th studio album titled \\"Sharnaagat\\" in 2012, surprising critics and fans with a new direction. Sharnaagat was the band's first spiritual record, with influences of pop, folk and blues. Frontman Palash's late father, Dr. Rupendra Kumar Sen, had composed 3 out of the 7 songs featured on the album. A music video was shot for the title track \\"Sharnaagat\\" in the premises of a Temple, Mosque, Church and a Gurudwara in Delhi with an attempt to portray the universality of God and religion. Palash directed the video with the entire band and its support staff doubling up as the production crew. Sharnaagat was released worldwide by Times Music Spiritual.  Music Video Halla Bol (2016)  Euphoria launched their brand new single on 21 June 2016, co-written by Palash Sen and Deekshant Sahrawat, Halla Bol, also composed and led by as vocalist by Palash, describes the song as “the war cry of the meek, the quiet and the non-pretentious common man. This almost six-minute song features the band’s commentary on India’s various issues with spoofs on Arvind Kejriwal, Arnab Goswami, Vijay Mallya and Aamir Khan’s ‘PK’.

Angered at Zoe's unshakable war connection to Mal, Wash demands a shot at a field assignment. Unfortunately, crime lord Niska chooses this moment to exact a brutal vengeance for Mal's failure to complete an earlier job.  Plot  On Serenity, as Simon reviews the data he collected on River in \\"Ariel\\", Shepherd Book looks over his shoulder, musing about a \\"warrior-poet\\" named Xiang Yu. Book cites a Xiang Yu quote that suggests that the way to truly learn about someone is to torture them, and wonders if this was the purpose behind the brain surgery done on River. Simon disagrees, believing there was a specific goal the unknown surgeons were hoping to achieve. Elsewhere, crime lord Adelei Niska is having another betrayer tortured, also alluding to Xiang Yu. His new lieutenant, Victor, interrupts him to announce a nearby Firefly-class ship that might belong to Malcolm Reynolds, the man who abrogated a business arrangement with Niska. Niska orders his man to fetch the culprit. Back on Serenity, Kaylee playfully chases River around the cargo bay, after the girl \\"took [her] apple\\", despite Jayne having contributed a crate's worth to the ship's stores. Once she takes hold of the apple, Kaylee claims that \\"no power in the 'verse can stop me.\\" Amid the noise, Inara urges Mal to respect the privacy of her imminently arriving client, a local councilor of some political importance. Mal reassures her that he won't cause a scene like the earlier one (\\"Shindig\\") that nearly got him killed. Inara is also concerned about the other crew \\"ogling\\" her client. Later, Zoe and Wash puzzle over Jayne's generosity as they munch on the apples. Kaylee asks why Zoe and Mal always cut up their apples, and Zoe (and Mal, who joins them) tell a war story about \\"griswalds\\", tiny pressure- sensitive explosive grenades that were embedded in apples by Alliance troops. Wash sardonically embellishes the story, annoyed at the frequent references to his wife's long history with the captain. Mal vetoes Wash's idea to improve their profit from the medicine sales by bypassing the local middlemen. Wash is surprised by this, because Zoe had told him that she hadn't run it by the captain. Later, Zoe admits to Wash that she had mentioned it, Mal disagreed, she accepted his judgment and then lied to Wash to spare his feelings. This makes Wash all the more upset because of her casual deference to Mal and dishonesty with him. In the Tams' quarters, River reminisces about her fun with Kaylee, but her chaotic thoughts intrude on her, despite Simon's treatments. Elsewhere, Book chides Kaylee and Jayne for trying to steal a peek at Inara's arriving client, who turns out to be a woman, against the crew's expectations. (Jayne's lecherous response, \\"I'll be in my bunk,\\" becomes a running gag throughout the episode.) Preparing the shuttle for their business rendezvous, Zoe and Mal discover that it has been sabotaged by Wash, who demands that he go with Mal to the meeting. He explains that he wants to take Zoe's place at Mal's side, so they don't bring back yet another tale of adventure-laden bonding. An annoyed Zoe leaves them to their mission, and Mal reluctantly agrees, more concerned about getting underway than participating in a domestic dispute. In her quarters, Inara massages the councilor, while remarking that when she chooses her rare female clients, she does so because they are extraordinary in some way, and hints that the councilor's gift is allowing Inara herself to relax and serve her own needs as well as the councilor's. Meanwhile, Wash defends his assumption of Zoe's role to Mal, and winds up hauling the merchandise to the meeting. As the deal goes down, the middlemen are killed by snipers who suddenly arise from the sand and capture Mal and Wash. Later, as Inara bids goodbye to her client, Zoe becomes concerned about what happened to their missing crew mates. Book volunteers to accompany them, and at the deserted meeting site determines the weaponry used to take their people. Zoe notices the abandoned supplies and a burn trail left on the ground by a short-range craft \\"not commonly part of a spaceship,\\" but of a space station. The evidence implicates Niska in the kidnapping. On Niska's skyplex, the kidnappees bicker, with Wash becoming increasingly incensed about both the danger that Mal regularly exposes Zoe to, and that she obeys Mal. Wash questions Mal's assertion that his first mate doesn't blindly obey him, but Mal backs it up by claiming he told her not to marry Wash. Niska appears and begins his Xiang Yu-inspired torture, but Wash and Mal spend the entire time continuing their bickering, all the while refusing to acknowledge the torture. Mal notices that Wash's anger keeps him from collapsing, so he hints about a sexual history with Zoe. Wash, however, is sure this never happened, and claims that Mal should sleep with her, just so his wife could get past what Wash feels is a fixation on her captain. Mal accepts to keep Wash from breaking. Meanwhile, Zoe collects all the funds remaining from the Ariel job in order to pay off Niska to release her shipmates, counting on his perverse code to treat this as a business transaction. She turns out to be correct, but Niska declares that she has only enough money to secure one man's release. Expecting to be entertained at Zoe's dilemma, Niska is disappointed when she chooses her husband before he even finishes his taunt. Niska, claiming she paid a little bit extra, severs Mal's ear and gives it to Zoe as a \\"refund\\". By the time Zoe gets Wash back to the shuttle, she immediately prepares a rescue mission. The rest of the crew, including an initially reluctant Jayne and a very calm Book, choose to assist Wash and Zoe, while Inara tries to gain assistance from the councilor. Wash takes Serenity in powered down for a precision stealth breach, allowing the crew to board the station before the defenders can respond. After Mal has endured further torture without breaking down, Niska has a device affixed to Mal's chest which forces thin tendrils underneath his skin, causing extreme pain. The treatment kills Mal, but his tormentors revive him, leaving the weakened captain lying unrestrained on a table as they slice him with wire cutters. As Zoe leads Jayne and Wash toward the torture room, Book, Simon, and Kaylee stay behind to prevent the station personnel from taking the ship. While Book and Simon hold their own, Kaylee is emotionally unable to attack, and retreats when pressed by enemy gunfire. River, who has stayed out of the gunfight until this point, appears and takes Kaylee's pistol. After a quick glimpse at the three attackers, River emerges, closes her eyes, and kills the enemy troops with three rapid, precise shots. She then proudly tells Kaylee \\"no power in the 'verse can stop me,\\" mimicking Kaylee from the earlier apple incident. Kaylee looks at River, clearly horrified. Deep inside the skyplex, the intrusion alarm distracts Niska. Mal uses the distraction to take out the torturer with the same tendril-producing device used on him earlier. As Mal starts to beat the retreating Niska, the torturer recovers, giving his boss a chance to escape. The rescuers arrive to find Mal being throttled by the torturer. Though Zoe initially suggests Mal must face his torturer alone, he exclaims in the opposite, and the crew guns the torturer down. Later, Mal joins the crew in Serenity's cargo hold, where he fiddles with his ear, reattached courtesy of equipment supplied by the councilor. Simon expresses discomfort at shooting people, but Book reassures him that it's unlikely he actually shot anyone in the gunfight. In the dining room, in a display of marital devotion, Zoe serves her recuperating husband some soup. Mal enters to remind Wash of the agreement they made during the torture. To Wash's objections, he explains to Zoe about their mutual \\"burning sexual tension\\". Zoe plays along, and just as the war veterans awkwardly move as if to embrace each other, Jayne walks in and comments that something about that was \\"downright unsettling\\". An irate Wash finally gets up, dragging his wife off. Jayne immediately descends upon the abandoned soup. Meanwhile, Kaylee looks nervously at River, no longer willing to play with her.  Continuity  * The opening scene, where Simon is prodding through River's brain scans and Book speaks of Simon's great heist, refers to the entirety of the previous episode, \\"Ariel\\".

It is the first of three episodes that were not broadcast in the original 2002 Fox run. Mal's \\"wife\\" Saffron convinces him to help her steal a valuable artifact, but the crew of Serenity suspects foul play.  Synopsis  The episode opens in a desert, where a naked Mal sits on a rock, staring into the distance and saying to himself: \\"Yeah… that went well.\\" During a cargo transfer 72 hours earlier, Mal meets up with Monty, a war buddy and fellow Browncoat turned smuggler. As Monty's crew unloads cargo, he tells Mal that he's gotten married, introducing his wife Bridget. \\"Bridget\\" turns out to be Mal's nemesis Saffron, and a fight breaks out between them. Enraged to learn of Saffron's double-dealing, Monty leaves without her, stranding her on the deserted moon where Mal is waiting for a pickup. Mal orders Saffron to walk away and be left behind, but reconsiders when she tempts him with the prospect of a lucrative heist. Later, Serenity arrives to pick up Mal and the unloaded cargo. Later Mal lets Saffron out of one of the loaded crates in the cargo bay. In the common room, Saffron describes to the crew her plan to steal a priceless antique laser pistol, the Lassiter, from Durran Haymer, a wealthy collector of Earth-That-Was artifacts. She claims a detailed knowledge of Haymer's security arrangements, but explains that the difficulty lies in getting the weapon off the estate, something Serenity's crew could accomplish. The crew is outraged that Mal has brought Saffron on board, but they reluctantly agree to the plan. Jayne is assigned to watch over Simon and River and keep them out of Saffron's sight. River worries about the situation, telling Simon she doesn't trust Saffron and that she knows Jayne had tried to betray the Tams to the Alliance. Meanwhile, Wash and Kaylee instruct Mal and Saffron to dump the collectible pistol, once they procure it, into an automated trash disposal unit, which Kaylee can reprogram to have the trash taken to a remote location where they can pick it up. Mal and Saffron enter the estate without difficulty. They find the room that houses the well- protected collectible, but are met by Durran himself. Durran rushes to Saffron and embraces her, calling her \\"Yolanda\\" and thanking Mal for bringing back his wife, who had apparently disappeared six years ago. Saffron insists that Durran provide some compensation for Mal's \\"rescue\\". Durran steps out to get reward money for Mal, to allow them to finish retrieving the pistol. As Durran reenters, he attempts to remonstrate with her, but Saffron knocks him out with a kick and leaves with Mal, who has discarded the antique in the trash chute after which they escape. Meanwhile, Wash has been hovering Serenity directly under the trash unit of Haymer's estate while Jayne retrieves the control unit and Kaylee reprograms it, clinging to the ship's hull. A delay arises during the windy EVA when Jayne is incapacitated by an electric shock, but Zoe helps Kaylee replace the control board just in time for the automated pickup vehicle to collect the trash unit. Jayne is dragged back on board by Shepherd Book. As Mal and Saffron fly toward the rendezvous in Isis Canyon, Mal continues to explore his theory that Durran was Saffron's true love and original husband. Saffron seems to become emotional, but when Mal is off guard, she secures his gun and takes him prisoner. Saffron orders Mal to disrobe as revenge for him seeing her naked in the episode \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds\\", and strands him in the desert before proceeding to the drop location. As Saffron searches through the garbage for the antique laser pistol, Inara emerges above her to taunt her with the weapon. The Companion reveals that she been part of the plan all along, knowing that Saffron would get the drop on them somehow and arranging to beat her at her own game of deception. Inara remotely closes the garbage container to trap Saffron for the authorities to pick up later. On Serenity, the crew discovers that Saffron has again sabotaged their ship, delaying their trip to the rendezvous so that Kaylee can make repairs. Jayne awakens in the infirmary to find that Simon has medically paralyzed him to rest a spinal injury. Simon reveals his knowledge of Jayne's plan to sell out the Tams, but reminds him that Serenity crew are a team, and that as Jayne's doctor he will never harm him. River, however, warns Jayne that she can kill him with her brain. Once repaired, Serenity makes it to Mal's location. Mal and Inara, having reached an understanding, trade jokes about the heist. Mal casually boards Serenity in front of his crew, still unclothed. Wash and Zoe are shocked by the captain's brazenness, but Kaylee cheerfully congratulates Mal as the ship lifts off from the desert. Continuity * Saffron first appeared in \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds\\", an episode that occurred \\"about a half a year back\\" from this one. * After Jayne stocks up Simon and River's cabin and leaves, River, in another paranormal instance, tells Simon that Jayne is afraid they'll know what he was attempting to do in \\"Ariel\\", two episodes past.

It is the second of three episodes (Trash, The Message and Heart of Gold) that were not broadcast in the original 2002 Fox run. A former Independence soldier, who had served with Mal and Zoe, returns in a dramatic manner, with a vicious Alliance officer chasing after him for some unusual smuggled goods.  Synopsis  The show opens on a space station, and a barker extolling an exhibit featuring \\"proof of alien life\\". Inside the exhibit, Simon and Kaylee stare at a tall, illuminated cylinder that holds a strange and apparently dead creature. The doctor declares that it is a mutated cow fetus, not an alien. Simon uses this moment alone with the engineer to attempt to get closer to her, but when he mentions that the other women he knows are either married (Zoe), professional (Inara), or related to him (River), Kaylee leaves in a huff. As Kaylee departs, Zoe and Wash enter. Back in the concourse, Inara tries to convince Mal to let her help fence the Lassiter they stole in \\"Trash\\", but Mal insists on keeping her out of that side of the business. Mal checks in with the station postmaster, who passes along two packages along with Serenity's mail. Jayne arrives to find that his mother has sent him a home-knitted cap, and he proudly dons it. The others observe the headgear with a mixture of amusement and sarcasm. The other shipped item is a huge crate addressed to Mal and Zoe. They open it to discover a dead body, the corpse of Private Tracey (Jonathan M. Woodward). Flashback to seven years earlier at the Battle of Du-Khang. As a young Independence soldier, Private Tracey, calmly prepares a meal behind cover, an Alliance soldier sneaks up on him. Just as the latter is about to shoot, Zoe appears behind him and cuts his throat. While she lectures the boy about stealth, Sgt. Reynolds comes screaming over some obstacles and crashes into their position. Tracey is injured when the Alliance zeroes in on them. Mal and Zoe grab Tracey and their shell-shocked lieutenant and bug out. Back in the present, the two ex-soldiers puzzle over the \\"decently preserved\\" corpse of their former comrade. Hauling the box aboard Serenity, they find a recorded message from Tracey. He apparently anticipated trouble from some unsavory associates and has asked them to ship his body home to St. Albans, finishing the message with an old saying from the war, \\"When you can't run anymore, you crawl, and when you can't do that...well, yeah, you know the rest.\\" Back on the station, an Alliance soldier, Lieutenant Womack (Richard Burgi), threatens first to imprison, then to burn to death the postmaster, who quickly tells the man and his aide who left with the encoffined body. On Serenity, Mal and Zoe entertain Inara with a hilarious tale about Tracey's antics during the war, such as when he 'stole' an officer's moustache and stuck it on his face. Suddenly, the ship is shaken by a warning shot from an Alliance craft. Lt. Womack hails them and demands to board Serenity. The crew mistakenly think that Womack is after the Lassiter. When Womack mentions \\"that crate\\", however, Mal realizes he's after Tracey's box, and stalls for time while they take apart the crate to discover what secrets it might contain. Finding nothing, they decide to have Simon autopsy the hapless soldier, but the doctors' first incision causes the \\"dead\\" man to leap up and struggle with the gathered crew. After he calms down, Tracey confesses that he is smuggling illegal internal organs. He was supposed to deliver the implanted organs on Ariel, but he got a higher bid. Unfortunately for him, the original buyers killed the new customer and are now after their stolen \\"merchandise\\". Another shot from Womack reminds them of their immediate peril. After a brief pursuit, the Alliance ship finally catches up with them. Book does some checking on their Alliance pursuers and discovers some anomalous behavior, and he recommends to Mal that they allow the Feds to board the ship. Tracey overhears some of this conversation and pulls a gun on the crew. Annoyed at Tracey, Mal orders Wash to call the Feds. As Tracey fires at Wash, Zoe shoots him in the chest, injuring him but not killing him. Lt. Womack and his men enter the cargo bay. He tries to cow the smugglers with his Alliance authority, but an unarmed Book arrives to explain why he won't be using that authority, given the pains he's taken to keep his extracurricular organ-dealing activity from the local Feds. Faced with a surprisingly direct threat of death from the preacher, Womack decides to depart, dismissing the \\"damaged goods\\" in Tracey's gravely-wounded chest. Tracey belatedly realizes that Book's confrontation was part of a plan, one that he ruined by threatening the crew and getting himself shot for his efforts. Mortally wounded, he asks Mal and Zoe to really deliver him home this time; they agree, finishing the earlier saying, \\"When you can't crawl anymore, you find someone to carry you.\\" Excerpts from Tracey's message can be heard as the crew of Serenity solemnly returns the fallen soldier to his grieving family. Production notes * \\"The Message\\" was the last Firefly episode filmed, by which time the cast and crew knew the show had been canceled. The final scene, in which Serenity's crew return Tracey's body to his family, marking an end to the former soldier's journeys, therefore had an extra poignancy for them. *Greg Edmonson, composer for the show, wrote the musical piece that is heard when Tracey is returned to his family not only as a farewell to Tracey, but as a farewell to the series itself. * Kaylee has expressed romantic interest in two men thus far — Simon and Tracey — who have threatened her life. Simon refused to treat her gunshot wound unless they protected River from the Alliance in \\"Serenity\\" (although Kaylee believed he was bluffing), and in this episode Tracey held her at gunpoint. Joss Whedon wryly observes in the DVD commentaries that threatening Kaylee became a formula for drama, one he admitted using in early Buffy episodes, in which he would put Willow in danger to win over the viewers. * In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, a joke is made at how the postmaster is apparently the only Jew in space; calling him a 'Space Jew', or 'Spajew' for short.

It is the last of three episodes that were not broadcast in the original 2002 Fox run. A Companion-trained friend of Inara's who runs a brothel calls for help from Serenity when a local bigwig reveals his intentions to take his baby from the woman he impregnated.  Synopsis  At a brothel in the middle of a barren land, a powerful man named Rance Burgess (Fredric Lehne), accompanied by thugs, approaches the madam, Nandi (played by Melinda Clarke), demanding to see a woman named Petaline (Tracy Leah Ryan). When Nandi denies the presence of Petaline, Burgess' thugs drag out Petaline, who is visibly several months pregnant, before Burgess, who extracts a DNA sample. He tells her he will return for his child if his test on the DNA proves the child to be his, threatening to cut it out of her if need be. Aboard the space vessel Serenity, Companion Inara Serra receives a distress call from Nandi, who it is revealed is a good friend of hers. After Nandi requests Inara's help, Inara goes to Captain Malcolm Reynolds. She explains that Nandi and the prostitutes who work in Nandi's brothel are not Companions, and are not protected by the Guild. After she relates their plight, Reynolds agrees to assist Nandi, but declines Inara's offer of payment for the deed. After Serenity lands near Nandi's ranch, Jayne Cobb takes advantage of the hospitality of the women there, while Shepherd Derrial Book joins some of the women in prayer, and Dr. Simon Tam goes to examine Petaline, who will give birth soon. Reynolds gets to know Nandi, who explains the poverty that Burgess enforces on the locals. Seeking to size up his opponent, Reynolds, along with Inara, attends a public event attended by Burgess, not informing him of his alliance with Nandi. Reynolds speaks with Burgess, and even examines the high-tech laser gun that Burgess carries with him. Reynolds ultimately confirms Nandi's assessment of Burgess. After Reynolds and Inara depart, Burgess receives confirmation that he is the father of Petaline's baby. Returning to Nandi's ranch, Reynolds offers to evacuate the area with Nandi and her people, rather than face \\"a monster who thinks he's right with God\\" and who won't back down after only a single thrashing from some temporary help, but Nandi refuses to leave her hard-earned property and way of life. Reynolds, who admires her stubborn streak, reluctantly decides to stay and accept the challenge of defending the ranch. As the Serenity prepare for an attack by Burgess and his forces, Serenity second-in-command Zoe Washburne has a tense conversation with her husband, pilot Hoban \\"Wash\\" Washburne, in which she insists that they will have a child in the near future. Petaline goes into labour, with Inara, Dr. Tam and his younger sister, River Tam, at Petaline's bedside. Nandi and Reynolds also spend time together, during which Nandi inquires about Reynolds' relationship with Inara, and relates her own past, which includes the Companion training she shared with Inara on the latter's home world, Sihnon. She says that Inara was in the running to become house priestess of House Madrassa when she suddenly left, without explanation, to travel among the Alliance worlds. Nandi had left before then, however, straining at the restrictions of Companion life. She moved to this border world and assumed control of the whorehouse from its previous owner, who kept the employees there addicted to drugs, and in so doing, she improved life for the girls. Mal and Nandi gradually move toward sex, pausing only when Nandi says \\"I ain't her\\", which Mal deflects without directly acknowledging her implication of his feelings for Inara. Back in town, one of Nandi's girls, Chari (Kimberly McCullough), reports to Burgess on Mal's preparations, after which Burgess rallies his men, proclaiming women's ordained place as submissive servants to men, which he demonstrates by ordering Chari to kneel in front of him to do \\"a few more chores\\" in front of the crowd. The next morning, Reynolds tries to explain his night with Nandi to Inara, but Inara calmly tells him that there is no reason to be embarrassed about his sex life, and also thanks him for comforting her friend. Nonetheless, Inara subsequently sobs deeply in private, and Nandi realizes that there was more to Inara's feelings than she let on. Burgess's men attack the ranch, and a battle ensues, with the Serenity crew joining forces with the ranch's residents to fend off Burgess's forces. On board the Serenity, Wash and mechanic Kaylee Frye trap some of Burgess' men, who invaded the ship, though Wash realizes that in so doing, he himself has been cut off from the bridge, preventing him from responding to Reynolds' call to join the battle. As Petaline gives birth, Chari lets Burgess inside. He quickly storms into Petaline's room, taking her newborn son. When Nandi tries to foil the kidnapping, Burgess fatally shoots her in the abdomen. He is pursued, however, by Reynolds, who captures him and drags him back to the ranch, where Petaline, holding her son, whom she has named Jonah, executes him. Petaline tells the remaining thugs to leave, and orders the traitorous Chari to go with them, as she no longer has a place there. Following a funeral for Nandi and the rest of the fallen, Serenity departs. Back on the ship, Inara reiterates her gratitude that Reynolds was able to comfort Nandi on what turned out to be her last night, but Reynolds can only regret his failure to save her. As Reynolds tries to broach the subject of his and Inara's unacknowledged feelings toward each other, Inara muses about how Nandi created a family, and how that kind of shared strength and love makes people never want to break away. She then informs him that she will be leaving Serenity.  Reception  \\"Heart of Gold\\" was nominated for a 2004 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form.

But River, feeling unwelcome on the ship, takes a novel approach to escaping from the long arm of the Alliance. The inspiration for this episode came from Tim Minear, who gave Whedon the idea by merely mentioning Boba Fett. Whedon expanded upon the suggestion and extrapolated it into the villain of this episode, the \\"preternaturally cool, nearly psychotic bounty hunter\\" Jubal Early. Whedon has said that if he were forced to pick one piece of work to represent his entire body of work, he would pick this episode.reddit AMA (April 10, 2012) River's and Early's tactile and spiritual connection with physical objects reflects an existential experience in Whedon's youth and his subsequent study of Jean-Paul Sartre's existential novel Nausea.DVD commentary for \\"Objects in Space\\", chapter 3.  Synopsis  As Serenity flies by a planet, River lies in bed listening to not-quite-audible voices. She arises and takes a walk through the ship's rooms and corridors, in her bare feet, encountering her shipmates in varied conversations with each other. Simon is relaxing with Kaylee in the common room, telling her an amusing anecdote about medical school. River suddenly \\"sees\\" them looking at her, with Simon telling her that he'd \\"be there right now\\", implying she is responsible for taking him away from his successful medical career. She then finds Jayne and Shepherd Book in the kitchen, where she \\"hears\\" Jayne repeat his confession to Mal about selling out the Tams on Ariel, and Book mutter an angry but cryptic statement hinting at his less wholesome past. River continues to wander the ship and is moved by the sound of ocean waves as Zoe and Wash passionately kiss on the nearby bridge. Above the cargo bay, as Mal and Inara discuss her impending departure, River sees their unspoken frustrations over their unrealized relationship. None of the people she encounters are aware of her presence - except when speaking directly to her - making it clear that this is River's mind \\"walking\\" telepathically through the ship. Fleeing the intense emotions, River runs down to the unoccupied cargo bay, where she spots a tree branch. She sees herself on leaf-strewn ground and picks up the branch, telling herself \\"It's just an object. Doesn't mean what you think.\\" Suddenly, the real world returns, and she finds that she is holding one of Jayne's pistols while the crew surrounds her in a panic, trying to get her to give up the weapon. Mal takes the gun from her and discovers it is loaded and ready to fire. When Mal admonishes her for handling loaded weapons, River runs off, crying. As Mal comments on how alone they are, a small vessel closes with Serenity, aboard which is a man reviewing wanted bulletins for Simon and River. Meanwhile, the crew discuss the dangers of River's presence on the ship. When Zoe muses whether River has ever handled a gun, Kaylee reluctantly tells everyone about her experience during their assault on Adelei Niska's SkyPlex, when River killed three attackers with single shots with her eyes closed. The crew begin to speculate that River may be a \\"reader\\", having psychic powers, and though Simon objects, they begin to question whether she is a danger to them. While talking, the crew are being listened to: outside the hull of Serenity, the bounty hunter has left his ship and has tapped into the hull, and below the room, in the cargo bay, River is listening through the floor plating. Once the crew goes to sleep, the bounty hunter boards Serenity. He first encounters Mal, quickly knocks him unconscious, drops him into his cabin, and then locks the rest of the sleeping crew in their cabins. He surprises Kaylee in the engine room, ties her up, and threatens to rape her if she does not cooperate. Next, he disables Book with a surprise attack. Simon hears a noise and rises to check on his sister, only to be attacked by the stranger, who addresses him by name. The bounty hunter, Jubal Early, waxes philosophically on the nature of things while he demands to know where River is. Though Simon refuses to help Early, the bounty hunter threatens to kill him and rape Kaylee if he refuses, and the doctor reluctantly agrees. With Simon accompanying him, Early checks out the cargo bay and shuttles. When Inara tries to appeal to Early's emotional side, he smacks her across the face, and then locks her in her shuttle. The two men finally arrive on the bridge, where Early settles on a direct threat, announcing loudly to the ship that he will kill Simon if River doesn't reveal herself. River then responds over the ship's intercom, telling Early about how she was unwanted on the ship but could not bring herself to leave, so she simply \\"melted away\\", becoming part of Serenity. In the engine room, River's voice comes over the intercom, reassuring Kaylee and asking her for help. On the bridge, Early is skeptical about River's claim, but she reveals uncanny knowledge of the bounty hunter's own weaknesses. Early gradually starts to accept the possibility that River has joined with the vessel. Meanwhile, River sends Kaylee, who has freed herself, to unlock the cabins. Zoe begins to prepare an assault, but River insists that they do not use guns, and instead tells Mal of an alternate plan. On the bridge, River continues her conversation with Early, needling him about his violent tendencies and his past. Early realizes that River is not part of Serenity, but she has managed to sneak onto his ship, which puts him on the defensive. River reassures him that she will go with him as his bounty, as she is a burden on her shipmates, and her departure will allow them to get on with their lives. As Early starts to leave, Simon tries to stop him, but in the process is shot in the leg. Jayne wakes up and pulls the curtain off of his weapons compartment, but just uses it as a blanket and returns to sleep. Leaving Simon in the cockpit, the bounty hunter starts his EVA back to his ship, but finds Mal outside, waiting in ambush. Mal shoves Early off into space, before welcoming River back aboard Serenity. Later, in the infirmary, Simon instructs Zoe as she removes the bullet from his leg. Inara walks away from Mal as he tries to examine her cut lip. In the cargo bay, Jayne mocks Book's failure to defeat Early, despite \\"all them years of priest trainin'\\", and Book implies that he fought Early and only succumbed after a prolonged fight. Their friendship apparently restored after being damaged by the events of War Stories, Kaylee and River play jacks while Kaylee relates a racy anecdote from her past. River picks up and examines the bouncing ball, with its swirling, multicolored surface. Meanwhile, Jubal Early tumbles helplessly through space and says, \\"Well... Here I am.\\" Themes In the DVD commentary Joss Whedon explains that this episode is intended to resolve the crew's tension regarding River, ending with their acceptance of her as a valuable member of the crew. Whedon struggled with various ideas of how to approach the script until Tim Minear gave him the idea of using a bounty hunter. =Existentialism= As Whedon discloses in the DVD commentary, much of the dialogue and imagery was inspired by Jean-Paul Sartre, especially his novel Nausea. In his essay We're All Just Floating in Space, Lyle Zynda analyzes this episode's interpretation of existential meaninglessness, arguing that both River and Early perceive physical objects as divorced from the meanings with which others imbue them. For example, when River picks up the gun, she sees it as a harmless branch—an object, as she says, that \\"doesn't mean what you think\\"—transformed by her perspective into a benign thing of beauty. Early likewise describes his gun as \\"pretty\\" with a pleasing weight (both features separate from its function) yet acknowledges that its design aids its intended use, which Whedon describes as \\"grotesque\\". While moving through the ship, both River and Early seem to be acutely aware of and derive sensual pleasure from their environment, stroking the walls, conscious of the physicality of their surroundings. Whedon notes in the DVD commentary that one of the ways he illustrated this quality was to keep camera focused on River's bare feet as she walked. Early, admiring specifics of the ship's design, significantly echoes the episode's title when he says, \\"People don't appreciate the substance of things. Objects in space.\\" It is the \\"physical implication\\" of a world without morals, the moral implication of which was verbalized by another of Whedon's creations, Angel: \\"If nothing we do matters, then all that matters is what we do.\\" Zynda argues that ultimately, River and Early's ability to experience objects divorced from their common meanings allows them to imbue those objects with a value of their choosing. Whereas River chooses a perspective that brings joyful wonder, and Early chooses to contemplate those same objects with despair. Early enacts one of Sartre's central ideas, the concept of \\"bad faith\\", when he denies his responsibility for his actions by claiming he is not free to do otherwise. When River accuses him of hurting people, he counters, \\"It's part of the job.\\" She replies, \\"It's why you took the job.\\"  Guest cast  * Richard Brooks as Jubal Early  References   * *  External links   \\"Objects in Space\\" at Firefly Wiki Category:2002 American television episodes Category:Firefly (TV series) episodes Category:American television series finales Category:Television episodes written by Joss Whedon Category:Television programs directed by Joss Whedon ","title":"Objects in Space"},{"id":"2472656","text":"House of Ill Fame is the first full-length album by Canadian hard rock band The Trews.

This system of particles has been studied for many years in order to understand its nature, origin, and relationship to larger bodies. In the Solar System, the interplanetary dust particles have a role in scattering sunlight and in emitting thermal radiation, which is the most prominent feature of the night sky's radiation, with wavelengths ranging 5–50 μm.Levasseur-Regourd, A.C., 1996 The particle sizes of grains characterizing the infrared emission near Earth's orbit typically range 10–100 μm.Backman, D., 1997 The total mass of the interplanetary dust cloud is approximately the mass of an asteroid of radius 15 km (with density of about 2.5 g/cm3). Straddling the zodiac along the ecliptic, this dust cloud is visible as the zodiacal light in a moonless and naturally dark sky and is best seen sunward during astronomical twilight. The Pioneer spacecraft observations in the 1970s linked the zodiacal light with the interplanetary dust cloud in the Solar System. Also, the VBSDC instrument on the New Horizons probe was designed to detect impacts of the dust from the zodiacal cloud in the Solar System.  Origin  The sources of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) include at least: asteroid collisions, cometary activity and collisions in the inner Solar System, Kuiper belt collisions, and interstellar medium grains (Backman, D., 1997). Indeed, one of the longest-standing controversies debated in the interplanetary dust community revolves around the relative contributions to the interplanetary dust cloud from asteroid collisions and cometary activity.  Life cycle of a particle  The main physical processes \\"affecting\\" (destruction or expulsion mechanisms) interplanetary dust particles are: expulsion by radiation pressure, inward Poynting-Robertson (PR) radiation drag, solar wind pressure (with significant electromagnetic effects), sublimation, mutual collisions, and the dynamical effects of planets (Backman, D., 1997). The lifetimes of these dust particles are very short compared to the lifetime of the Solar System. If one finds grains around a star that is older than about 10,000,000 years, then the grains must have been from recently released fragments of larger objects, i.e. they cannot be leftover grains from the protoplanetary disk (Backman, private communication). Therefore, the grains would be \\"later- generation\\" dust. The zodiacal dust in the Solar System is 99.9% later- generation dust and 0.1% intruding interstellar medium dust. All primordial grains from the Solar System's formation were removed long ago. Particles which are affected primarily by radiation pressure are known as \\"beta meteoroids\\". They are generally less than 1.4 × 10−12 g and are pushed outward from the Sun into interstellar space.  Cloud structures  The interplanetary dust cloud has a complex structure (Reach, W., 1997). Apart from a background density, this includes: * At least 8 dust trails—their source is thought to be short-period comets. * A number of dust bands, the sources of which are thought to be asteroid families in the main asteroid belt. The three strongest bands arise from the Themis family, the Koronis family, and the Eos family. Other source families include the Maria, Eunomia, and possibly the Vesta and/or Hygiea families (Reach et al. 1996). * At least 2 resonant dust rings are known (for example, the Earth-resonant dust ring, although every planet in the Solar System is thought to have a resonant ring with a \\"wake\\") (Jackson and Zook, 1988, 1992) (Dermott, S.F. et al., 1994, 1997)  Dust collection on Earth In 1951, Fred Whipple predicted that micrometeorites smaller than 100 micrometers in diameter might be decelerated on impact with the Earth's upper atmosphere without melting. The modern era of laboratory study of these particles began with the stratospheric collection flights of D. E. Brownlee and collaborators in the 1970s using balloons and then U-2 aircraft. Although some of the particles found were similar to the material in present-day meteorite collections, the nanoporous nature and unequilibrated cosmic-average composition of other particles suggested that they began as fine-grained aggregates of nonvolatile building blocks and cometary ice.P. Fraundorf, D. E. Brownlee, and R. M. Walker (1982) Laboratory studies of interplanetary dust, in Comets (ed. L. Wilkening, U. Arizona Press, Tucson) pp. 383-409. The interplanetary nature of these particles was later verified by noble gas and solar flare track observations. In that context a program for atmospheric collection and curation of these particles was developed at Johnson Space Center in Texas. This stratospheric micrometeorite collection, along with presolar grains from meteorites, are unique sources of extraterrestrial material (not to mention being small astronomical objects in their own right) available for study in laboratories today. Experiments Spacecraft that have carried dust detectors include Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Ulysses (heliocentric orbit out to the distance of Jupiter), Galileo (Jupiter Orbiter), Cassini (Saturn orbiter), and New Horizons (see Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter).

When Genghis Khan attacked the city during the war between the Khwarizmi Shah and the Mongols, Sayyid Ajall Shams al-Din Omar's family surrendered to him. He was allegedly descended from Ali bin Abi Talib and the Prophet, Sayyid Ajall's father was Kamāl al-Dīn and his grandfather was Shams al-Dīn 'Umar al-Bukhārī. According to Marshall Broomhall, Shams al-Din, \\"who was a native of Bokhara, is said to have been a descendant of Mohammed (twenty-seventh generation).\\" Sayyid participated in Mongke Khan's conquest of Sichuan and was in charge of logistics. He served the court of the Yuan dynasty at Yanjing (modern day Beijing). Later, he was in charge of Imperial finances in 1259,(Original from the University of California) sent to Yunnan by Kublai Khan after conquering the Kingdom of Dali in 1274. After his death, Sayyid was given the posthumous name Zhongyi (忠懿). Later, the imperial court conferred the title \\"Prince of Xianyang\\" (咸陽王) and the posthumous name Zhonghui (忠惠) on him.

I think it not unlikely, that the Mohammedans now scattered over the whole of China proper, and forming large communities especially in the provinces of Kansu, Shansi and Chili,' are for the greater part descendants of those Saracens mentioned by M. Polo in the same provinces. Rashid-eddin states, in his description of China (Yule's Cathay, p. 269), that in his time all the inhabitants of Karadjang (or Yunnan) were Mohammendans; and I feel tolerably certain also, that the Mohammedan power, which suddenly rose in the Chinese province of Yunnan, about ten years ago, may be traced back to the time of the Mongol emperors. 43\\\\.

The International History Review, Vol. 26, No. 2, pp. 237-256 The Confucian temple that Sayyid Ajall built in 1274, which also doubled as a school, was the first Confucian temple ever to be built in Yunnan. Both Confucianism and Islam were promoted by Sayyid Ajall in his \\"civilizing mission\\" during his time in Yunnan.Atwood, Christopher P. \\"Sayyid Ajall 'Umar Shams-ud-Din.\\" Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire.

Sayyid Ajall viewed Yunnan as \\"backward and barbarian\\" and utilized Confucianism, Islam, and Buddhism for \\"civilizing\\" the area. In Yunnan, the presence of Islam is credited to Sayyid Ajall's work. Sayyid Ajall was first to bring Islam to Yunnan. He promoted Confucianism and Islam by ordering construction of mosques and temples of Confucianism.(Original from the University of Virginia) Sayyid Ajall also introduced Confucian education into Yunnan.The Hui ethnic minority He was described as making \\"the orangutans and butcherbirds became unicorns and phonixes [sic] and their felts and furs were exchanged for gowns and caps\\", and praised by the Regional Superintendent of Confucian studies, He Hongzuo.( ) Shams al-Din constructed numerous Confucian temples in Yunnan, and promoted Confucian education. He is best known among Chinese for helping sinicize Yunnan province. He also built multiple mosques in Yunnan as well. Confucian rituals and traditions were introduced to Yunnan by Sayyid Ajall. Several Confucian temples and schools were founded by him. Chinese social structures, and Chinese style funeral and marriage customs were spread to the natives by Sayyid Ajall. The aim of Sayyid Ajall's policy of promoting Confucianism and education in Yunnan was to \\"civilize\\" the native \\"barbarians\\". Confucian rituals were taught to students in newly founded schools by Sichuanese scholars, and Confucian temples were built. The natives of Yunnan were instructed in Confucian ceremonies like weddings, matchmaking, funerals, ancestor worship, and kowtow by Sayyid Ajall. The native leaders has their \\"barbarian\\" clothing replaced by clothing given to them by Sayyid Ajall. Both Marco Polo and Rashid al-Din recorded that Yunnan was heavily populated by Muslims during the Yuan Dynasty, with Rashid naming a city with all Muslim inhabitants as the 'great city of Yachi'.(Original from the University of Virginia) It has been suggested that Yachi was Dali City (Ta-li). Dali had many Hui people.(Original from the University of Virginia) His son Nasir al- Din became Governor of Yunnan in 1279 after Sayyid Ajall died.( )(Original from the University of Virginia) The historian Jacqueline Armijo-Hussein has written on Sayyid Ajall's Confucianization and Sinicization policies, in her dissertation Sayyid 'Ajall Shams al-Din: A Muslim from Central Asia, serving the Mongols in China, and bringing 'civilization' to Yunnan,Dissertations in Central Eurasian Studies the paper The Origins of Confucian and Islamic Education in Southwest China: Yunnan in the Yuan Period,Session 8: Individual Papers: New Work on Confucianism, Buddhism, and Islam from Han to Yuan and The Sinicization and Confucianization in Chinese and Western Historiography of a Muslim from Bukhara Serving Under the Mongols in China. He repaired and built many mosques, such as the Daxuexi Mosque and great Mosque in Xi'an. The Daxuexi Alley Mosque in Xi'an has a stele erected in 1523, indicates to the reforms and construction of the mosque by him. Family Sayyid Ajall's oldest son was Nasir al-Din.( ) Sayyid Ajall's 7th generation descendant was Sai Hazhi. Sayyid Ajall was a 26th generation descendant of the Prophet Muhammad and fifth generation descendant of Su fei-erh. In total, had had five sons. He had two tombs, one in Wo-erh-to in Yunnan and another memorial which contained his clothes in Xi'an in Shaanxi province. The author of \\"The Magnetic Needle of Islam\\", Ma Chu (1630–1710), was a descendant of Sayyid Ajall. The d'Ollone expedition during the Qing dynasty recorded that Imam Na Wa-Ch'ing was the leader of the family of descendants of Sayyid Ajall.( )( ) Ma repaired Sayyid Ajall's tomb. Another romanization of Ma Chu is \\"Ma Zhu\\".( ) Sayyed Ajall's descendants included 15th generation- Ma Zhu and 25th generation- Ma Dexin. Sayyid Ajall is the ancestor of many Muslims in areas all across China. Yunnan contained the greatest number of his descendants. One of his most prominent descendants was Zheng He.Shih-Shan Henry Tsai: Perpetual Happiness: The Ming Emperor Yongle. Washington Press 2002, p. 38 () In the thirteenth century the influence of individual Muslims was immense, especially that of the Seyyid Edjell Shams ed-Din Omar, who served the Mongol Khans till his death in Yunnan AD 1279. His family still exists in Yunnan, and has taken a prominent part in Muslim affairs in China.(Original from Harvard University) He is identified as the ancestor of many Chinese Hui lineages in Yunnan's Panthay Hui population as well as in Ningxia and Fujian provinces. A Hui legend in Ningxia links four surnames common in the region - Na, Su, La, and Ding - with the descendants of Shams al-Din's son named Nasruddin, who \\"divided\\" their ancestor's name (Nasulading, in Chinese) among themselves. The Ding family of Chendai, Fujian claims descent from him. The Ding family has branches in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Malaysia among the diaspora Chinese communities there, no longer practicing Islam but still maintaining a Hui identity. It was the Ming loyalist Confucian Hui Muslim scholar Ma Zhu (1640-1710) from Yunnan who traced many Hui lineage's ancestry back to Sayyid Ajall, constructing genealogies for them, specifically claiming that Hui who were not surnamed Ma were descended from Sayyid Ajjall, like Hui surnamed Na, Su, La, and Ding, while tracing his own ancestry and other Hui in Yunnan who were surnamed Ma to the Ming Muslim official Sai Haizhi. The deputy secretary- general of the Chinese Muslim Association on Taiwan, Ishag Ma (馬孝棋), has claimed \\"Sayyid is an honorable title given to descendants of the Prophet Mohammed, hence Sayyid Shamsuddin must be connected to Mohammed\\".

Onni Bovellan was born in Kiuruvesi, Finland on 27 December 1917 to parents Joona Bovellan and Olga Miina Kärkkäinen. He was a frail child and was not originally expected to live long. However, he survived and became healthy. After finishing school, Bovellan went to work in a sawmill. In the Winter War, Bovellan fought in Colonel Hjalmar Siilasvuo's troops. He led many successful patrols to Soviet territory and was awarded the Iron Cross. After the Winter War, Onni Bovellan changed his surname to Palaste. He worked as director of the Vuokatti sports academy and also met his wife Kerttu Klemetti. Onni Palaste started writing factual, but slightly dramatised novels about the Winter War in 1967. His original inspiration to writing was winning a short story competition during the war, after which his fellow soldiers suggested he try writing full-length novels. He had written about twenty war novels, the latest of which was published in 2004. He has also written a three-novel mini-series about Simo Hurtta, a Swedish tax official during the 17th-18th century Greater Wrath. Onni and Kerttu Palaste lived their elder years in Helsinki, Finland.

In today's administrative boundaries, it is located in southern Bistrița-Năsăud County and north-central Mureș County. Beginning in the 12th century and increasingly in the 13th-14th centuries, Hungarian kings invited German colonists to settle in the eastern lands of the Kingdom of Hungary; these German settlers became known as the Transylvanian Saxons. The Saxons in the southeast settled in the Burzenland, while the settlers in the northeast established towns along the Bistrița and Mureș rivers beginning in the early 13th century. As the latter settlers' first major town in the area was Nösen on the Bistrița in 1206, the surrounding area became known as the Nösnerland. The largest cities of this region were Nösen, later known as Bistritz (Bistrița in Romanian), in the north and Sächsisch- Regen (Reghin in Romanian) in the south. After Romania signed a truce with the Soviet Union during World War II, the evacuation of the German population of northeastern Transylvania was ordered by the German military in 1944. After the fall of the Communist regime of Romania in 1989, additional Transylvanian Germans have emigrated from their homeland to Germany. Towns and villages In each case, the modern Romanian name is given first, followed by the historic German and Hungarian names. *Albeștii Bistriței (Weißkirch bei Bistritz, Kisfehéregyház) *Arcalia (Kallesdorf, Árokalja) *Batoș (Botsch, Bátos) *Bistrița (Nösen / Bistritz, Beszterce) *Chiraleș (Kyrieleis, Kerlés) *Corvinești (Niederneudorf, Kékesújfalu) *Cușma (Auen / Kuschma, Kusma) *Dedrad (Deutsch-Zepling, Dedrád) *Dipșa (Dürrbach, Dipse) *Domnești (Attelsdorf / Billak, Bilak) *Dorolea (Kleinbistritz, Aszubeszterce) *Dumitra (Mettersdorf, Szentdemeter) *Dumitrița (Waltersdorf, Kisdemeter) *Ghinda (Windau, Vinda) *Herina (Mönchsdorf, Harina) *Ideciu de Jos (Niedereidisch, Alsóidecs) *Ideciu de Sus (Obereidisch, Felsőidecs) *Jelna (Senndorf, Kiszsolna) *Lechinţa (Lechnitz, Szászlekence) *Livezile (Jaad, Jád) *Logig (Ludwigsdorf, Ludvég) *Monariu (Minarken, Malomárka) *Moruț (Moritzdorf, Aranyosmóric) *Năsăud (Nassod / Nußdorf, Naszód) *Orheiu Bistriţei (Burghalle, Óvárhely) *Petelea (Birk, Petele) *Petriș (Petersdorf bei Bistritz, Petres) *Posmuș (Paßbusch, Paszmos) *Reghin (Sächsisch-Regen, Szászrégen) *Sângeorzu Nou (Sankt Georgen bei Lechnitz, Szászszentgyörgy) *Sâniacob (Jakobsdorf bei Bitritz, Szászszentjakab) *Satu Nou (Oberneudorf, Felsőszászújfalu) *Sigmir (Schönbirk, Szépnyír) *Slătinița (Pintak, Pinták) *Șieu (Groß-Schogen, Nagysajó) *Șieu-Măgheruș (Ungersdorf, Sajómagyarós) *Tărpiu (Treppen, Szásztörpény) *Teaca (Tekendorf, Teke) *Tonciu (Tatsch, Tacs) *Uila (Weilau, Vajola) *Unirea (Wallendorf, Aldorf) *Vermeș, Bistrița (Wermesch, Vermes) *Viile Tecii (Großeidau, Kolozsnagyida) *Viișoara (Heidendorf, Besenyő) See also *Burzenland *Carpathian Germans *Danube Swabians *Transylvanian Saxons  External links  * Map showing German settlements in Transylvania * Umriss Nösnerland und Reener Ländchen * Holzkirchen im Nösnerland Category:Transylvanian Saxon communities Category:Historical regions of Transylvania Category:Bistrița-Năsăud County Category:Mureș County ","title":"Nösnerland"},{"id":"2472711","title":"2000 AFL season"},{"id":"2472727","text":"Huaiyin may refer to the following settlements in the People's Republic of China: *Huai'an (), named Huaiyin before 2001, a prefecture-level city in Jiangsu *Huaiyin District, Huai'an (), Jiangsu *Huaiyin District, Jinan (), Shandong ","title":"Huaiyin"},{"id":"2472748","text":"Youth playing a game of cricket on Langman's oval Langman Reserve is a large reserve situated in the Adelaide foothills between the suburbs of Burnside and Waterfall Gully, South Australia.

The aim of the society is to foster and strengthen relationships between these young people at the national and international levels, and to encourage and assist them in developing their faith. Origin of name The word juventutem is a declension of the Ecclesiastical Latin juventus, meaning \\"youth\\", and is taken from Psalm 42(43):4, as used in the opening prayers of the Traditional Mass, which the priest and altar server recite at the foot of the altar: Introibo ad altare Dei. Ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam. (\\"I will go in to the altar of God; to God who gives joy to my youth.\\") In the Catholic understanding, the term juventutem refers to the spiritual youth that comes from the grace of Jesus Christ. Development Juventutem was established in April 2004 (and first given its name in May 2004) with the intention of having a delegation present at the international World Youth Day in 2005 and in subsequent years. The first Juventutem meeting was in 2005 in Cologne, Germany, and was the first official delegation to any World Youth Day. More than 1,000 young people from more than 20 countries attended World Youth Day 2005 with Juventutem. Two cardinals and eight bishops participated in parts or all of the two-week meeting, as well as many priests, religious and seminarians from several countries. Juventutem groups have participated in each of the subsequent World Youth Day festivals: World Youth Day 2008 (Sydney, Australia), World Youth Day 2011 (Madrid, Spain), World Youth Day 2013 (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), and World Youth Day 2016 (Kraków, Poland). Juventutem participated in World World Youth Day 2019 in Panama City, Panama where they held the first Solemn Pontifical Mass in the country since the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in 1965. Archbishop Alexander King Sample presided over this liturgy. =Fœderatio Internationalis Juventutem= An umbrella organization, the Fœderatio Internationalis Juventutem (F.I.J.) was founded on 24 May 2006. Early in its existence, the FIJ numbered more than fifteen nation-based groups, including ones in the United States, UK, Ireland, Australia, France, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, Lithuania, Scotland, England, The Netherlands, Poland, Kenya, Hong Kong, and Hungary. Members of the international Juventutem federation focus on the daily sanctification of youth according to the traditions of the Catholic Church. Attending World Youth Days is one of the possible means provided in order to reach that goal. As a consequence, those who are unable to attend World Youth Days (for various reasons) can join or start a local group within the international Juventutem federation — one such group is Young Catholic Adults (YCA), which was established in 2004 in the UK.

They consist of a cluster of stratovolcanoes and are the most active volcanoes in northern Honshu. The central volcano of the group includes several lava domes and a tuff cone, Goshiki-dake, which contains a crater lake named \\"Okama\\" (御釜). Also known as the \\"Five Color Pond\\" (五色沼, goshiki numa) because it changes color depending on the weather, it lies in a crater formed by a volcanic eruption in the 1720s. The lake is in diameter and deep, and is one of the main tourist attractions in the area. One striking feature of Zaō's famous ski resorts is the \\"snow monsters\\" (樹氷, Juhyō) that appear in mid- winter. Strong wind over the nearby lake fling water droplets which freeze against the trees and their branches, until near-horizontal icicles begin to form. Falling snow settles on the ice formations, and the end result is a grotesque figure of a tree. The effect of a full forest of such trees gives visitors a ghostly impression. Zaō is one of the 100 famous mountains in Japan. Rotaria rotatoria and Pinnularia spp. are found in the acidic Okama Lake.

The melody is written in modern Western music notation, the lyric is written as text below the staff and the harmony is specified with chord symbols above the staff. The lead sheet does not describe the chord voicings, voice leading, bass line or other aspects of the accompaniment. These are specified later by an arranger or improvised by the performersBenward & Saker (2003). Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I, p.76. Seventh Edition. ., and are considered aspects of the arrangement or performance of a song, rather than a part of the song itself. A lead sheet may also specify an instrumental part or theme, if this is considered essential to the song's identity. For example, the opening guitar riff from Deep Purple's \\"Smoke on the Water\\" is a part of the song; any performance of the song should include the guitar riff, and any imitation of that guitar riff is an imitation of the song. Thus the riff belongs on the lead sheet. A collected volume of lead sheets may be known as a fake book.Woodwind Brasswind: \\"What is a fake book?\\"  Performance with lead sheets  A lead sheet is often the only form of written music used by a small jazz ensemble. One or more musicians will play the melody while the rest of the group improvises an appropriate accompaniment based on the chord progression given in the chord symbols, followed by an improvised solo also based on the chord progression. Similarly, a sufficiently skilled jazz pianist is able to accompany a singer and perform a song by themself using only a lead sheet. Lead sheets are not intended for novices. Sometimes, melodies with syncopation are written with the syncopation omitted, so the reader must be familiar with the songs \\"by ear\\" to play the melodies correctly. Some 32 bar forms do not have a printed melody during the \\"B\\" section, as the lead instrumentalist is expected to improvise one. Similarly, the chord progressions for some blues tunes omit the turnaround (often simply indicating two bars on the tonic), as it is expected that an experienced jazz player will know the appropriate turnarounds to insert (e.g., (I–VI7–ii–V7). The reader needs to have thorough familiarity with extended chords (e.g., C13) and altered chords (e.g., C711). Introductions and codas are often omitted, as it is expected that players will know the familiar intros and codas used on specific songs. Lead sheets are often bound together in a fake book. A variant type of lead sheet contains only the chord progressions to the song. These sheets could be used by the rhythm section instruments to guide their improvised accompaniment and by \\"lead instruments\\" for their improvised solo sections, but since they do not contain the melody, they can be used in performances only by players who have the melodies memorized. Lead sheets are commonly used at informal \\"jam sessions\\" and at jazz shows at small nightclubs and bars.  Lead sheet as legal definition of a song  The melody, lyrics, and harmony define what a song is. In the music industry and entertainment law, a lead sheet is the document used to describe a song for legal purposes. For example, a lead sheet is the form of a song to which copyright is applied—if a songwriter sues someone for copyright violation, the court will compare lead sheets to determine how much of the song has been copied. Or if a song is considered for an Academy Award or a Grammy, the song is submitted for consideration in the form of a lead sheet.  History  A predecessor to lead sheets was created in May 1942 when George Goodwin, a radio station director, released the first Tune-Dex cards. Printing on index cards that had the same size as library catalog cards, Goodwin provided lyrics, melody and chord symbols as well as copyright information. Goodwin also promoted the cards to professional musicians until 1963, when poor health forced his retirement. For many years the \\"standard\\" fake books were called simply \\"Fake Books\\". All were composed of songs illegally printed, with no royalties paid to the copyright owners. In 1964, the FBI's Cleveland, Ohio, office observed that \\"practically every professional musician in the country owns at least one of these fake music books as they constitute probably the single most useful document available\\". The first two volumes, Fake Book Volume 1 and Fake Book Volume 2, issued in the late 1940s and 1950s, together comprised about 2000 songs dating from the turn of the 20th century through the late 1950s. In the 1950s the Modern Jazz Fake Book, Volumes 1 and 2 was issued, and Fake Book Volume 3, containing about 500 songs, came out in 1961. The music in Fake Books 1, 2, and 3 was photocopied or reset with a musical typewriter from the melody lines of the original sheet music. Usually chord symbols, titles, composer names, and lyrics were typewritten, but for a number of songs these were all photocopied along with the melody line. The chord changes in these books were notoriously inaccurate. Most of them were based on the guitar and ukulele chords commonly found in earlier sheet music, which often did not include the roots of the harmony. For example, a chord labeled \\"Fdim\\" (\\"F diminished\\") for guitar or ukulele might functionally be a G79 (\\"G seven, flat nine\\") chord, which has a G as the root plus all the notes of an Fdim7 chord. Thus, successfully using the Fake Books required the expertise of jazz musicians and others trained in functional harmony in order to reinterpret the chord symbols. The three Fake Books were well indexed, alphabetically as well as by musical genre and Broadway show. Although the tunes in the Fake Books were compiled illegally, the creators printed copyright information under every song — perhaps to give the false impression that the Fake Books were legal, or to show respect for the creators. The Modern Jazz Fake Book was divided into two sections, each indexed separately as Volume One and Volume Two. The music was transcribed by hand from recordings, and each transcription included performer name, record label, and catalog number. Unlike today's fake and \\"real\\" books that have \\"jazz\\" in their titles, the Modern Jazz Fake Book included no standards, but only original tunes written and recorded by jazz musicians. All these books have been long out of print, though music students have photocopied the books from other musicians. Fake books originally infringed copyrights, and their circulation was primarily underground. During the school year of 1974–75, an unidentified group of musicians based at the Berklee College of Music in Boston published the Real Book,My Guitar Pal: \\"History of the Real Book\\" which claimed to fix all problems of poor design, although it was riddled with errors, which were gradually corrected by generations of players. Steve Swallow, who was teaching at Berklee at that time, said the students who edited the book intended \\"to make a book that contained a hipper repertoire, more contemporary repertoire\\". It was popular and in its turn spawned a number of \\"fake Real Books\\". In the 2000s, some types of \\"real books\\" have been published which fully respect copyright laws. In the same period, some electronic \\"fake books\\" became available, which offer instant transposition. This facilitates the performance of music at shows where some performers have transposing instruments, or in shows with a singer who wants the band to play in a different key to accommodate their vocal range.

Intimately related are law reform bodies or law commissions, which are organizations set up to facilitate law reform. Law reform bodies carry out research and recommend ways to simplify and modernize the law. Many law reform bodies are statutory corporations set up by governments, although they are usually independent from government control, providing intellectual independence to accurately reflect and report on how the law should progress. Law reform activities can include preparation and presentation of cases in court in order to change the common law; lobbying of government officials in order to change legislation; and research or writing that helps to establish an empirical basis for other law reform activities. The four main methods in reforming law are repeal (get rid of a law), creation of new law, consolidation (change existing law) and codification. Definition The expression \\"law reform\\" is used in a number of senses and some of these are close to being wholly incompatible with each other.Hurlburt, William H. Law Reform Commissions in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. Juriliber. 1986. Page 3. In the Law Reform Commission Act 1975, the expression \\"reform\\" includes, in relation to the law or a branch of the law, its development, its codification (including in particular its simplification and modernisation) and the revision and consolidation of statute law, and kindred words must be construed accordingly.The Law Reform Commission Act 1975, section 1 Correlation with judicial reform Judicial reform is the complete or partial political reform of a country's judiciary. Judicial reform is often done as a part of wider reform of the country's political system or a legal reform. The President of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, Valery Zorkin, gives in his article, \\"Twelve Theses on Legal Reform in Russia\\", first published in Russian magazine Legislation and Economics, N. 2, 2004 an explained correlation between legal and judicial reform: \\"Complete legal reform should normally include not only judicial reform, but also reform of various aspects of the structural system and content of legislation, legal education, legal awareness by the population, and also the corporate consciousness of the whole legal community. Judicial reform usually aims to improve such things as law courts, procuracies, advocacy (bar), inquest, executory processes, and record keeping.\\" .\\"The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform\\", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007) Relation with economics Legal reform can be the driver for all other reforms, including reform of the economy. A true market economy cannot be created without ensuring both full guarantees of private property and transparent predictability for entrepreneurial activity, on the one hand; and sufficiently reasonable legal control over economic processes, on the other hand. Legal reform should be an integral part of any on-going reform process. Legal reform is a tool for implementing necessary reforms, to balance competing interests, create a dynamic and sustainable economy, and build a sustainable civil society. During last decades the judiciary became active in economic issues related with economic rights established by constitution because \\"economics may provide insight into questions that bear on the proper legal interpretation\\".Posner R. The Constitution as an Economic Document. The George Washington Law Review. November 1987. Vol. 56. No. 1 Since many a country with a transitional political and economic system continues treating its constitution as an abstract legal document disengaged from the economic policy of the state, practice of judicial review of economic acts of executive and legislative branches became to grow. The budget of the judiciary in many transitional and developing countries is completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the separation of powers, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject of the constitutional economics. It is important to distinguish between the two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and various privileges), and the private.Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009 Russian example In modern Russia, aspects and directions of development of judicial reform were formulated in the Judicial Reform Concept, enacted by the Russian Parliament on October 24, 1991. This document still remains legally valid and applicable. Valery Zorkin stressed that \\"the separation of powers principle, also proclaimed in the Constitution of the Russian Federation, requires observance of judicial independence. And such independence requires proper funding of the courts and their activities. It is well known that Russian courts remain under-funded. However, the cumulative economic costs suffered by both state and private enterprises as the result of under-performance by various judicial institutions, especially by the courts of general jurisdiction and the arbitration courts, is at least twice the order of magnitude as the financial burden carried by the state and society in financing such judicial institutions. The elimination of under-funding of the courts would definitely improve the efficiency of their work and be worthwhile. Taking into account the specifics of historical developments in Russia, one may assert that without undertaking a large-scale legal reform it would be extremely difficult to succeed concurrently with judicial reform. It is necessary now to start unfolding a full-scale legal reform, which has to be completed by the year 2020. The official public presentation and implementation of such legal reform should become the prime responsibility of executive and legislative authorities. The program of legal reform needs to be adopted in the form of a legislative act.\\"The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform\\", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007) See also *Constitutionalism *Democratization *Deregulation *Drug policy reform *Judiciary *Independence of the judiciary *Liberalization *Land reform *Rule of law *Rule according to higher law NotesReferences * \\"Economics and the Rule of Law\\" The Economist (2008-03-13).

It is also considered an invaluable work of Persian literature.موسوی، مصطفی. «تاریخ جهانگشای» ، دائرةالمعارف بزرگ اسلامی. بازبینی‌شده در ۲۰ نوامبر ۲۰۱۱. This account of the Mongol invasions of his homeland Iran, written based on survivor accounts, is one of the main sources on the rapid sweep of Genghis Khan's armies through the nomadic tribes of Tajikistan and the established cities of the Silk Road including Otrar, Bukhara, and Samarkand in 1219, and successive campaigns until Genghis Khan's death in 1227 and beyond. His writing is sometimes inflated, as when he estimates the strength of the Mongol army at 700,000, against other accounts that put the number between 105,000 and 130,000. His descriptions are often written from a sense of drama: of the fall of Assassin castle Maymun-Diz in November 1256, where he was present at the siege, he describes the effect of trebuchet (catapult) bombardment on the battlements: > The first stones which were discharged from them broke the defenders' > trebuchet and many were crushed under it. Fear of the quarrels from the > crossbows overcame them so that they were in a complete panic and tried to > make shields out of veils [i.e. they did best to defend with very > indadequate equipment.] Some who were standing on towers crept in their > terror like mice into holes or fled like lizards into the crannies of the > rocks. Juvayni's descriptions are, however, a very valuable resource for contemporary Mongol history, along with the work of Rashid al-Din, and the Secret History of the Mongols. One of his convincing descriptions is that of the Mongol hunt or nerge as an army training exercise for the nomadic Mongols. In a the whole army rounded up all the animals over a large region, in order to obtain dried meat before the onset of winter. In the time of Genghis Khan, the was converted into an exercise in discipline with severe punishments (the Yasa/Jasa/Zasagh is without respect of persons and according to the author Mirhond enjoins corporal punishment without respect of persons for those who allow animals to escape) for commanders of tens, hundreds, or thousands, who let animals escape. Once rounded up, the animals were ruthlessly massacred, first by the Khan, then by princes, and finally, only after so commanded, by all the army. This was to form a model for the ruthlessness of Mongol attacks on well-established human settlements. The painting of Khubilai Khan and his Khatun Chabi who was childless however would show an average hunt with slow- moving horses and watching for quarry. The sadistic scene envisioned by Juvaini wherein crowded animals of all types seek to flee, seems too close to the promised biblical Day of Judgement, since lions would have attacked oxen. Nonetheless it is likely that Hulagu Khan and his Christian Khatun Doqez increased hunting due to their Latin allies, who also may have impeded Mongol victory at Ain Jalut. An account of the tragic failure of a Chinese student - (Jiang Rong: \\"The Wolf\\") - to save a wild wolf of a type formerly hunted by the historical Mongol people and their descendants still today, would indicate wolves were targeted by such hunts as traditional methods of the ravaging wolves in imminent danger of extinction were described. Snow leopards and others were also likely to have been hunted. It is reported in \\"Mongol Warrior 1200-1350\\" by Stephen Turnbull and Wayne Reynolds available on Google Books that the Mongols ate horse milk powder with water, around 250 grammes a day although an account they quote mentions they took 4.5 kg along for an expedition, and claims they hunted on campaign, such as digging around for marmots, it also said they ate horse meat (it is known that the wild Przewalski horses were eaten which contributed to their extinction, but that may have been due to food shortage and was later than the period of the historical Mongols when possibly even these horses were some of them still domestic), on the other hand they also drank blood from their horses by temporarily opening a vein when in shortage. However it is also stated that they failed at times to prevent their horses from dying of hunger. However, William of Rubruck, reports a more moderate but identical style of hunting specifically of the Tatars, so Juvaini could still be exaggerating. After the fall of Merv, the people were rounded up and distributed among the soldiers in tens, hundreds and thousands, and each man in the remaining Mongol army was assigned the execution of \\"three to four hundred people.\\" However, there is no doubt that this type of savagery was part of the terror spread by the Mongol army.

At the peak of its popularity, the show was syndicated to 21 other markets in the western US, including San Francisco, Honolulu, Portland Oregon, and Tucson Arizona. On August 17, 2020 The Radio Hall of Fame has announced its list of inductees for its 2020 class. Longtime 95.5 KLOS Los Angeles morning hosts Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps (Longstanding Local/Regional). https://www.radiohalloffame.com/2020-inductees History In 1985, Thompson was working as a disc jockey when he was introduced to Phelps, whose background was in improvisational comedy. Their first joint on-air appearance was in 1986 on WAPI-FM (I-95) in Birmingham, Alabama, where the initial incarnation of The Mark & Brian Show began. Charlie West was hired to be the Program Director for KLOS in May 1987. He had a reputation for nurturing morning show talent and worked with Jeanne Tripplehorn aka \\"Jeannie Summers\\" on the air at KMOD Radio in Tulsa, OK before she ever got into the movies. One day, West came into Music Director Stephanie Mondello's office, sat down and said, \\"I've been listening to these audition tapes and there are these two guys, Mark and Brian.\\" He played Mondello the audition tape. Then he said, \\"There's something about these guys I think I can work with.\\" West and KLOS GM, Bill Sommers flew to Birmingham to meet Mark and Brian. Soon afterward an offer to move west and take over the morning slot at KLOS led to the premiere of The Mark & Brian Show in Los Angeles on September 8, 1987. The Mark & Brian Show included sketches and annual events (including a golf tournament and a Christmas all-star rock concert). Popular sketches included \\"The Red Carpet Minute with Edward Gordon,\\" \\"Miniature Theater,\\" and other celebrity-based sketches. They were #1 in Los Angeles until 1992, when Howard Stern's syndicated show came to Los Angeles and took over the #1 spot in the Arbitron ratings. In 1995 Mark & Brian convinced Frank Jordan, mayor of San Francisco, California to shower with them, completely nude, during a live radio show just before election day. In 2006, they conducted their version of the reality TV-based contest \\"Two Strangers and a Wedding,\\" in which single women auditioned to be the bride, then chose from five male finalists to marry --without ever meeting before the wedding. In 2007, the concept was modified to \\"Three Strangers and a Wedding,\\" in which the bride chose two of the five male finalists to come to the wedding. Upon meeting the bride at the wedding, the grooms had the option of proposing to the bride, who could then accept either proposal or decline them both. Each of the resulting marriages was brief and ended in divorce. On June 13, 2012, Thompson announced that he was retiring from radio after 25 years at the end of his contract, and would be moving to Charlotte, North Carolina with his wife. His last day at KLOS was revealed to be August 17, 2012. During Thompson's farewell show, Phelps announced that he, too, would be leaving KLOS, bringing The Mark & Brian Show to an end. Former producers include Frank Murphy (aka \\"Mr. Owl\\") Nicole Sandler, Johnny Vega, and Rosemary Jimenez. Their last producer was Ted Lekas. Reunion On April 8th, 2019, KLOS, Mark Thompson, and Brian Phelps announced they would have a one-off reunion show on April 25th, 2019. The show was to celebrate KLOS' 50th anniversary as well as promote The Mark & Brian Show for the Radio Hall of Fame. The official show was to run from 3–7 pm. They were also to make a guest appearance earlier that day at 9 am with Frosty, Heidi & Frank. Awards Mark & Brian are two-time winners of the Billboard Magazine \\"Air Personalities of the Year\\" award, and received a 1991 National Association of Broadcasters Marconi Award as \\"Air Personalities of the Year.\\" They have also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Mark & Brian will be inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame on October 29, 2020. Charitable donations Mark & Brian released three CD compilations of material from their morning show: All of Me (1995), You Had To Be There (1997), and Little Drummer Boys (2000). All proceeds were donated to their favorite charities. Other appearances The popularity of their radio show gave Mark & Brian several opportunities to branch out into other entertainment media. In 1991–92, they hosted a short-lived NBC TV series, The Adventures of Mark & Brian. The duo also appeared in several motion pictures, notably Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (the 1993 ninth installment of the Friday the 13th series), the documentary Trekkies (1997), and The Princess Diaries (2001). They played concerned onlookers in the made-for-TV movie A Very Brady Christmas during one of the scenes at the collapsed building. They also appeared unbilled as caterers in the Married... with Children episode \\"Married...with Prom Queen\\". They also played extras on Cheers (\\"Veggie-Boyd\\" – S9:E10), where they got to sit at the bar, much to the annoyance of the other extras. Mark & Brian also had a \\"special appearance\\" in a 1993 episode of The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., (S1 E14, \\"Mail Order Brides\\"), playing two cowboys walking into a whiskey only bar.

Higgins covered World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, and in the process advanced the cause of equal access for female war correspondents. She had a long career with the New York Herald Tribune (1942–1963), and later, as a syndicated columnist for Newsday (1963–1965). She was the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize for Foreign Correspondence awarded in 1951 for her coverage of the Korean War. In Phil Pisani's book \\"Maggies Wars\\" the main character is based on the life of Marguerite Higgins. Early life and education Higgins was born in Hong Kong, where her father, Lawrence Higgins, was working at a shipping company. The family moved back to the United States three years later. She worked for The Daily Californian, the University of California, Berkeley newspaper, serving as an editor in 1940. While at Berkeley, she was a member of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority. After graduating from Berkeley in 1941 with a B.A. in French, she earned a masters degree from the Columbia University School of Journalism. Career Eager to become a war correspondent, Higgins persuaded the management of the New York Herald Tribune to send her to Europe, after working for them for two years, in 1944. After being stationed in London and Paris, she was reassigned to Germany in March 1945. She witnessed the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp in April 1945 and received a U.S. Army campaign ribbon for her assistance during the surrender by its S.S. guards. She later covered the Nuremberg war trials and the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin. In 1950, Higgins was named chief of the Tribunes Tokyo bureau. Shortly after her arrival in Japan, war broke out in Korea, she came to the country as one of the first reporters on the spot. On 28 June, Higgins and three of her colleagues witnessed the Hangang Bridge bombing, and were trapped on the north bank of Han River as a result. After crossing the river by raft and coming to the U.S. military HQ in Suwon on the next day, she was quickly ordered out of the country by General Walton Walker, who argued that women did not belong at the front and the military had no time to worry about making separate accommodations for them. Higgins made a personal appeal to Walker's superior officer, General Douglas MacArthur, who subsequently sent a telegram to the Herald Tribune stating: \\"Ban on women correspondents in Korea has been lifted. Marguerite Higgins is held in highest professional esteem by everyone.\\"\\"Last Word\\", TIME, July 31, 1950. This was a major breakthrough for all female war correspondents. As a result of her reporting from Korea, Higgins received the 1950 George Polk Memorial Award from the Overseas Press Club and shared with five male war correspondents the 1951 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting.\\"International Reporting\\". The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 2013-12-02. She contributed along with other major journalistic and political figures to the Collier's magazine collaborative special issue Preview of the War We Do Not Want, with an article entitled \\"Women of Russia\\". Higgins continued to cover foreign affairs throughout the rest of her life, interviewing world leaders such as Francisco Franco, Nikita Khrushchev, and Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1955, she established and was chief of the Tribunes Moscow bureau. In 1963, she joined Newsday and was assigned to cover Vietnam, \\"visited hundreds of villages\\", interviewed most of the major figures, and wrote a book entitled Our Vietnam Nightmare.Higgins, back jacket. Personal life In 1942, she married Stanley Moore, a philosophy professor at Harvard but they divorced.

Known as the \\"First Lady of the Black Press\\", she was a columnist, lecturer, and freelance writer. She combined advocacy with journalism as she reported on the Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s and 1960s, and was known for asking questions others dared not ask. First published in The Chicago Defender in 1950, she worked for that paper through the 1970s, becoming the paper's Washington correspondent and editor for a period of about 20 years. She became the first female African-American commentator employed by a national network when CBS hired her in 1972. In addition to her reporting of American domestic politics, she also covered international stories, working as a syndicated columnist.  Early life and education  Payne was born in Chicago, Illinois, to William A. Payne, a Pullman porter who was the son of Tennessee farmers who were former slaves and Bessie Payne (née Austin), a former Latin teacher who was from Ohio, the daughter of former slaves from Kentucky. Payne was the fifth of six children: her siblings were Alice Wilma Payne, Thelma Elizabeth Payne, Alma Josephine Payne, Lemuel Austin Payne, and Avis Ruth Payne. Payne grew up on Chicago's South Side. The family first settled in West Englewood, then West Woodlawn, and then moved back to West Englewood, where in 1917 they bought a house, which was located across the street from the Greater Saint John AME Church of Chicago, where the family attended church and participated in community events. Payne attended Copernicus Elementary School, then Lindblom Technical High School, where one of her writing teachers had also taught Ernest Hemingway. Both schools had very few African-American students, and walking to school was often challenging. From the late 1920s to early 1930s, Payne attended City Colleges of Chicago, then known as Crane Junior College, the Garrett Institute, and the Chicago Training School for City, Home and Foreign Missions. In the 1940s, Payne received a three-year certificate. From 1940 to 1942, she attended night school at Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University.  Career  From 1939 to 1947, Payne worked as a library assistant at the Chicago Public Library. In May 1948, Payne left her job as a senior library assistant at the Chicago Public Library to move to Tokyo, where she had a job as a service club hostess at the Army Special Services club, an organization similar to the Red Cross. She held this job from 1948 to 1951, eventually becoming the Director of United States Army service club, quartermaster depot in Tokyo, Japan. Payne yearned to be a writer at a time when few such opportunities existed for African-American women. Payne began her journalism career rather unexpectedly while in Japan. She allowed a visiting reporter from The Chicago Defender to read her journal, which detailed her own experiences as well as those of African-American soldiers. Impressed, the reporter took the journal back to Chicago and soon Payne's observations were being used by The Defender, an African-American newspaper with a national readership, as the basis for front-page stories. In 1951, Payne moved back to Chicago to work full-time for Sengstacke Newspapers, the publisher of The Chicago Defender. She worked as an Associate editor and reporter from 1951 to 1978. After working there for two years, in 1953, Payne took over the paper's one-person bureau in Washington, D.C. and became the Washington correspondent for Sengstacke Newspapers, a position she held until 1973. In addition to national assignments, Payne was afforded the opportunity to cover stories overseas, becoming the first African-American woman to focus on international news coverage.Shellie M. Saunders, \\"Ethel L. Payne\\", Gale Contemporary Black Biography. In this position, Payne was only one of three accredited African Americans on the White House Press Corps. Asian-African Conference in Bandung, Indonesia, April 1955. During Payne's twenty-five year career with The Chicago Defender, she covered several key events in the Civil Rights Movement, including the Montgomery bus boycott and desegregation at the University of Alabama in 1956, as well as the 1963 March on Washington.\\"Obituaries: Ethel Payne, 79, Dies; Was a Correspondent\\", New York Times, June 1, 1991. She and the African American author Richard Wright attended the 1955 Bandung Conference, and Wright showcased some of his exchanges with her in his 1956 book The Color Curtain: A Report on the Bandung Conference. Payne earned a reputation as an aggressive journalist who asked tough questions. She once asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower when he planned to ban segregation in interstate travel. The President's angry response that he refused to support special interests made headlines and helped push civil rights issues to the forefront of national debate. In 1964, Payne attended the signing by President Johnson of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, where the President gave her one of the pens he used to sign the legislation. In 1966, she traveled to Vietnam to cover African-American troops, who were involved in much of the fighting. She subsequently covered the Nigerian civil war and the International Women's Year Conference in Mexico City, and accompanied Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on a six-nation tour of Africa. In 1972 she became the first African-American woman radio and television commentator on a national network, working on CBS's program Spectrum from 1972 to 1978, and after that with Matters of Opinion until 1982. In 1978, Payne became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Payne served as a professor for the School of Journalism at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee for one year. Payne continued writing and advocated for the release of Nelson Mandela. In an interview a few years prior to her death, Payne said, “I stick to my firm, unshakeable belief that the black press is an advocacy press, and that I, as a part of that press, can’t afford the luxury of being unbiased . . . when it come to issues that really affect my people, and I plead guilty, because I think that I am an instrument of change.” On May 28, 1991, aged 79, Payne died of a heart attack at her home in Washington, D.C.

He met his future wife, Sarah Goff, during the 1866 cholera epidemic in Wapping, where he first determined a need for a children's hospital in the East End of London. Heckford died of tuberculosis (then known as consumption) at the age of 29. The hospital started in 1868 in a warehouse in Ratcliffe, and moved after his death to Glamis Road, Shadwell. It was the first London hospital for children under two years of age. It was described in some detail by Charles Dickens in two pieces called 'A Small Star in the East' and 'On An Amateur Beat' published in The Uncommercial Traveller. In 1932 it was renamed as the Princess Elizabeth of York Hospital for Children. A decade later, it amalgamated with the Queen's Hospital for Children, which had been founded in 1867 as the Dispensary for Women and Children. The newly merged institution was called Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children until its closure in 1963. Heckford Street, off the east end of The Highway, commemorates Dr. Heckford. Created in the early 21st century, it is a small business park, mostly occupied by electrical and building trades. Sources * \\"East London Hospital for Children\\" by V.A.J.

Victor Gollancz) Red Azalea is a memoir of Chinese American writer Anchee Min (b. 1957). It was written during the first eight years she spent in the United States, from 1984 to 1992, and tells the story of her personal experience during the Cultural Revolution. Story The memoir was written in English. The names of the characters were translated into English instead of being spelled phonetically. For example, Min's first name, Anchee, means Jade of Peace, and her siblings' names are Blooming, Coral, and Space Conqueror. The autobiography deals with themes of ideology and gender and sexual psychology. =Part one= In part one, Min tells the story of her childhood in Shanghai under the rule of Mao Zedong during the 1960s. She believes wholeheartedly in Mao's Communism, and is an outstanding student. Her first conflict with this system comes when a favorite teacher is put on trial for espionage and the young Anchee Min is expected to testify against her. =Part two= Part two tells of her life on a farm outside of Shanghai with other teenagers. She is moved to a place called Red Fire Farm, a labor camp. She was assigned to work there and has little hope of escaping her life of manual labor. At this point, Min finds a role model to follow and stays on track with Maoism. She soon finds difficulty, however, when a friend is mentally broken by interrogation and humiliation after being discovered in a sexual situation with a man. Abuse of power by her superiors and a lesbian relationship with another farm-worker further erode Min's trust in Maoism. At the end of Part Two, she has been selected to move back to Shanghai and train to be an actress. =Part three= Part three is the story of her training at a film studio, in competition with other young trainees. More abuse of power and complex love relationships exacerbate her disillusion with Mao's system. She comes in and out of favor with her superiors in the film studio, depending on who is in charge. Eventually, her acting career falls through, and Min works as a clerk in the studio. At the end of part three, in 1976, Mao dies, and his wife Jiang Qing is arrested. The next few years are briefly mentioned, and the memoir ends with a short explanation of how Min came to live in the United States in 1984. Edition *Red Azalea.

A biased graph is a generalization of the combinatorial essentials of a gain graph and in particular of a signed graph. Formally, a biased graph Ω is a pair (G, B) where B is a linear class of circles; this by definition is a class of circles that satisfies the theta-graph property mentioned above. A subgraph or edge set whose circles are all in B (and which contains no half-edges) is called balanced. For instance, a circle belonging to B is balanced and one that does not belong to B is unbalanced. Biased graphs are interesting mostly because of their matroids, but also because of their connection with multiary quasigroups. See below. Technical notes A biased graph may have half-edges (one endpoint) and loose edges (no endpoints). The edges with two endpoints are of two kinds: a link has two distinct endpoints, while a loop has two coinciding endpoints. Linear classes of circles are a special case of linear subclasses of circuits in a matroid. Examples * If every circle belongs to B, and there are no half-edges, Ω is balanced. A balanced biased graph is (for most purposes) essentially the same as an ordinary graph. * If B is empty, Ω is called contrabalanced. Contrabalanced biased graphs are related to bicircular matroids. * If B consists of the circles of even length, Ω is called antibalanced and is the biased graph obtained from an all-negative signed graph. * The linear class B is additive, that is, closed under repeated symmetric difference (when the result is a circle), if and only if B is the class of positive circles of a signed graph. * Ω may have underlying graph that is a cycle of length n ≥ 3 with all edges doubled. Call this a biased 2Cn . Such biased graphs in which no digon (circle of length 2) is balanced lead to spikes and swirls (see Matroids, below). * Some kinds of biased graph are obtained from gain graphs or are generalizations of special kinds of gain graph. The latter include biased expansion graphs, which generalize group expansion graphs. Minors A minor of a biased graph Ω = (G, B) is the result of any sequence of taking subgraphs and contracting edge sets. For biased graphs, as for graphs, it suffices to take a subgraph (which may be the whole graph) and then contract an edge set (which may be the empty set). A subgraph of Ω consists of a subgraph H of the underlying graph G, with balanced circle class consisting of those balanced circles that are in H. The deletion of an edge set S, written Ω − S, is the subgraph with all vertices and all edges except those of S. Contraction of Ω is relatively complicated. To contract one edge e, the procedure depends on the kind of edge e is. If e is a link, contract it in G. A circle C in the contraction G/e is balanced if either C or C \\\\cup e is a balanced circle of G. If e is a balanced loop or a loose edge, it is simply deleted. If it is an unbalanced loop or a half-edge, it and its vertex v are deleted; each other edge with v as an endpoint loses that endpoint, so a link with v as one endpoint becomes a half-edge at its other endpoint, while a loop or half-edge at v becomes a loose edge. In the contraction Ω/S by an arbitrary edge set S, the edge set is E − S. (We let G = (V, E).) The vertex set is the class of vertex sets of balanced components of the subgraph (V, S) of Ω. That is, if (V, S) has balanced components with vertex sets V1, ..., Vk, then Ω/S has k vertices V1, ..., Vk . An edge e of Ω, not in S, becomes an edge of Ω/S and each endpoint vi of e in Ω that belongs to some Vi becomes the endpoint Vi of e in Ω/S ; thus, an endpoint of e that is not in a balanced component of (V, S) disappears. An edge with all endpoints in unbalanced components of (V, S) becomes a loose edge in the contraction. An edge with only one endpoint in a balanced component of (V, S) becomes a half-edge. An edge with two endpoints that belong to different balanced components becomes a link, and an edge with two endpoints that belong to the same balanced component becomes a loop. Matroids There are two kinds of matroid associated with a biased graph, both of which generalize the cycle matroid of a graph (Zaslavsky, 1991). =The frame matroid= The frame matroid (sometimes called bias matroid) of a biased graph, M(Ω), (Zaslavsky, 1989) has for its ground set the edge set E. An edge set is independent if each component contains either no circles or just one circle, which is unbalanced. (In matroid theory a half-edge acts like an unbalanced loop and a loose edge acts like a balanced loop.) M(Ω) is a frame matroid in the abstract sense, meaning that it is a submatroid of a matroid in which, for at least one basis, the set of lines generated by pairs of basis elements covers the whole matroid. Conversely, every abstract frame matroid is the frame matroid of some biased graph. The circuits of the matroid are called frame circuits or bias circuits. There are four kinds. One is a balanced circle. Two other kinds are a pair of unbalanced circles together with a connecting simple path, such that the two circles are either disjoint (then the connecting path has one end in common with each circle and is otherwise disjoint from both) or share just a single common vertex (in this case the connecting path is that single vertex). The fourth kind of circuit is a theta graph in which every circle is unbalanced. The rank of an edge set S is n − b, where n is the number of vertices of G and b is the number of balanced components of S, counting isolated vertices as balanced components. Minors of the frame matroid agree with minors of the biased graph; that is, M(Ω−S) = M(Ω)−S and M(Ω/S) = M(Ω)/S. Frame matroids generalize the Dowling geometries associated with a group (Dowling, 1973). The frame matroid of a biased 2Cn (see Examples, above) which has no balanced digons is called a swirl. It is important in matroid structure theory. =The lift matroid= The extended lift matroid L0(Ω) has for its ground set the set E0, which is the union of E with an extra point e0. The lift matroid L(Ω) is the extended lift matroid restricted to E. The extra point acts exactly like an unbalanced loop or a half-edge, so we describe only the lift matroid. An edge set is independent if it contains either no circles or just one circle, which is unbalanced. A circuit is a balanced circle, a pair of unbalanced circles that are either disjoint or have just a common vertex, or a theta graph whose circles are all unbalanced. The rank of an edge set S is n − c + ε, where c is the number of components of S, counting isolated vertices, and ε is 0 if S is balanced and 1 if it is not. Minors of the lift and extended lift matroids agree in part with minors of the biased graph. Deletions agree: L(Ω−S) = L(Ω)−S. Contractions agree only for balanced edge sets: M(Ω/S) = M(Ω)/S if S is balanced, but not if it is unbalanced. If S is unbalanced, M(Ω/S) = M(G)/S = M(G/S) where M of a graph denotes the ordinary graphic matroid. The lift matroid of a 2Cn (see Examples, above) which has no balanced digons is called a spike. Spikes are quite important in matroid structure theory. Multiary quasigroups Just as a group expansion of a complete graph Kn encodes the group (see Dowling geometry), its combinatorial analog expanding a simple cycle of length n + 1 encodes an n-ary (multiary) quasigroup. It is possible to prove theorems about multiary quasigroups by means of biased graphs (Zaslavsky, t.a.) References *T. A. Dowling (1973), A class of geometric lattices based on finite groups.

Construction Example cone of a \\\\Theta-graph emanating from p with orthogonal projection line l \\\\Theta-graphs are specified with a few parameters which determine their construction. The most obvious parameter is k, which corresponds to the number of equal angle cones that partition the space around each vertex. In particular, for a vertex p, a cone about p can be imagined as two infinite rays emanating from it with angle \\\\theta = 2\\\\pi/k between them. With respect to p, we can label these cones as C_1 through C_k in a counterclockwise pattern from C_1, which conventionally opens so that its bisector has angle 0 with respect to the plane. As these cones partition the plane, they also partition the remaining vertex set of the graph (assuming general position) into the sets V_1 through V_k, again with respect to p. Every vertex in the graph gets the same number of cones in the same orientation, and we can consider the set of vertices that fall into each. Considering a single cone, we need to specify another ray emanating from p, which we will label l. For every vertex in V_i, we consider the orthogonal projection of each v \\\\in V_i onto l. Suppose that r is the vertex with the closest such projection, then the edge \\\\\\\\{p,r\\\\\\\\} is added to the graph. This is the primary difference from Yao Graphs which always select the nearest vertex; in the example image, a Yao Graph would include the edge \\\\\\\\{p,q\\\\\\\\} instead. Construction of a \\\\Theta-graph is possible with a sweepline algorithm in O(n \\\\log{n}) time. Properties \\\\Theta-graphs exhibit several good geometric spanner properties. When the parameter k is a constant, the \\\\Theta- graph is a sparse spanner. As each cone generates at most one edge per cone, most vertices will have small degree, and the overall graph will have at most k \\\\cdot n = O(n) edges. The stretch factor between any pair of points in a spanner is defined as the ratio between their metric space distance, and their distance within the spanner (i.e. from following edges of the spanner). The stretch factor of the entire spanner is the maximum stretch factor over all pairs of points within it. Recall from above that \\\\theta = 2\\\\pi/k, then when k \\\\geq 9, the \\\\Theta-graph has a stretch factor of at most 1/(\\\\cos\\\\theta - \\\\sin\\\\theta).

Her first of four releases for Geffen Records, it was released in 1982 and represents her departure from jazz to a more 1980s pop sound. This was her first album to work with bassist Larry Klein, whom she married in 1982. Klein would play bass on and co-produce her next four albums. The resulting world tour took Mitchell through the U.S., Europe, Asia and Australia. A video of the tour was released in 1983, entitled Refuge of the Roads. The recorded performances were not performed in front of a live audience, but rather recorded live in a studio once the tour had been completed, with applause dubbed-in in post-production.

Pro Air, a scheduled passenger airline, was based at the airport and grounded by the FAA due to poor maintenance performance. The airport now has no scheduled passenger airline service. The airport's passenger terminal is also operated by the US Customs department, which serves private and cargo airplanes. The passenger terminal includes space for restaurants, retail concessions, car rental facilities, airline offices, baggage pick-up and claim areas, boarding areas and passenger lounges. The airport has three 1,000 space parking lots. The airport was listed as an asset of the city of Detroit which could be sold to cover debts as a result of the city's 2013 bankruptcy filing. The future of the site as a functioning airport after such a sale is unclear. The city of Detroit says that the facility has staff and is operational. It is listed as an asset of the city, but its future plans are in doubt.

In 2007 the airport had 77,571 aircraft operations, average 212 per day: 88% general aviation and 11% air taxi and 1% military. 97 aircraft were then based at the airport: 84% single-engine, 11% multi-engine, 4% jet and 1% ultralight.Air Routing International Until around 1965 a gas tank 330 ft tall was at 42.40817N 83.00926W NAD83, less than 630 ft west of the centerline of runway 15/33. In 1989 mayor Coleman A. Young abandoned a plan to expand the airport's runway because the adjoining Gethsemane Cemetery blocked the way, and surviving relatives protested. A few years later Southwest Airlines ended operations there, citing the city's inability to keep its promises and the need for longer runways to allow for larger jets. in 1988, complaints were registered because the city removed/discarded several families' memorial statuary without notification, replacing them with simple flat in-ground markers, stating that the statues posed a collision risk should an airplane go off the end of the runway. The segment of E. McNichols (6 Mile) Road. between Conner Ave. and French Rd at the north end of the airport was closed off and annexed to the airport, allowing for expansion of the approach to Runway 15 and additional service roads.

These collaterals project to area CA1 of the hippocampus and are an integral part of memory formation and the emotional network of the Papez circuit, and of the hippocampal trisynaptic loop. It is one of the most studied synapses in the world and named after the Hungarian anatomist- neurologist Károly Schaffer. As a part of the hippocampal structures, Schaffer collaterals develop the limbic system, which plays a critical role in the aspects of learning and memory. The signals of information from the contralateral CA3 region leave via the Schaffer collateral pathways for the CA1 pyramidal neurons. Mature synapses contain fewer Schaffer collateral branches than those synapses that are not fully developed. Many scientists try to use the Schaffer collateral synapse as a sample synapse, a typical excitatory glutamatergic synapse in the cortex that has very well been studied in order to try to identify the rules of both the patterns of stimulation in electrical rules and the chemical mechanisms by which synapses get persistently stronger and which synapses get persistently weaker as well and to develop medication and treatment to cure the chronic diseases, such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, they believe that studying the Schaffer collateral can provide a whole range of understanding how Schaffer collaterals allow us to intervene with drug-treatments and with electrical- stimulation so that the quality of human experience can be improved. Development \\"Schaffer collateral is the conductor of the orchestra, but not the actual instrument that plays the music\\" - Dr. Patrick K. Stanton . The functional hippocampus stores long-term memories through synaptic plasticity in terms of storing information. The hippocampus in communication with the neocortex mediates memory degradation. Plastic changes occurring in the hippocampus are involved in directing the process of memory storage. The Schaffer collateral is involved in activity-dependent plasticity and the information processes that always are processed through the hippocampus all the time. The Schaffer collateral clearly affects whether the target cells fire action potentials or not. However, at the same time, it is triggering the process that takes much longer whereby some synapses get stronger and some get weaker, and overall the patterns of synaptic strength of the network all evolve over time. Moreover, Schaffer collateral axons develop excitatory synapses that are scattered over the dendritic arborization of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. In the early stage of long-term potentiation, Schaffer collaterals release glutamate that binds to AMPA receptors of CA1-dendrites. The process of developing a network of CA3-to-CA1 recurrent excitatory glutamatergic synapses alters the frequency of spontaneous action potentials in Schaffer collaterals. By adulthood, CA3 recurrent network activity is reduced, the frequency of spontaneous action potentials is decreased in Schaffer collaterals, and a single release locus synapse with one dendritic spine on a given CA1 pyramidal neuron can be developed by Schaffer collateral axons. Location The Schaffer collateral is located between the CA3 region and CA1 region in the hippocampus. Schaffer collaterals are the axons of pyramidal cells that connect two neurons (CA3 and CA1) and transfer information from CA3 to CA1. The entorhinal cortex sends the main input to the dentate gyrus (perforant pathway). From the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, connections are made to the CA3 regions of the hippocampus via mossy fibers. CA3 sends the information signals to CA1 pyramidal cells via the Schaffer collateral and commissural fibers from the contralateral hippocampus as well. Function Throughout the memory process in the hippocampus, Schaffer collaterals seem not to play a major role in the formation of actual memory, but it is clear that Schaffer collaterals assist the activity- dependent plasticity and the information processes that are always altered over the course of memory development in the hippocampus. Schaffer collaterals alter the development of the limbic system that is critical for learning and memory. The contralateral CA3 region sends information through Schaffer collateral to the CA1 pyramidal neurons. Schaffer collateral and hippocampal synaptic plasticity Plastic changes occurring in the hippocampus are involved in directing the process by which memories get stored. Schaffer collaterals affect the hippocampus to develop short (Short-term Plasticity) and long term synaptic plasticity (Long-term Plasticity) in terms of storing information and changing in the efficiency of synaptic transmission following previous synaptic activity. =Long-term Potentiation= Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal formation is an example model for neural plasticity. Schaffer collateral synapses have been used as a sample synapse, a typical excitatory glutamatergic synapse in the cortex that has very well been studied in order to try to identify the rules of both the patterns of stimulation in electrical rules and the chemical mechanisms by which synapses get persistently stronger and which synapses get persistently weaker as well. LTPs are involved in how people store information and how they retrieve information and involve networks of memories that are involved in facts and in emotions as well because the hippocampus is the part of the limbic system connected to the amygdala. LTP in the hippocampus is an important model for neural plasticity that contributes to learning and memory. Schaffer collaterals are the axons of the neurons in the CA3 regions of the hippocampus that form synapses in the CA1 regions. The hippocampus is a part of the feedback process that sends signals to stop cortisol production. Thus, a damaged hippocampus can cause memory loss and inability of cognitive function. Furthermore, as the hippocampus is the region controlling learning and memory processes, the research on Schaffer collaterals may help to find treatments for diseases related to the hippocampus or its neural processing pathways such as Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder. Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength at Schaffer collateral synapses has largely been attributed to changes in the number and biophysical properties of AMPA receptors (AMPARs). Neuropsin has a regulatory effect on Schaffer collateral LTP in the rat hippocampus. The functional hippocampus needs to store long- term memories. Once the memories are stored, they remain stored for a long time. Long-term changes in synaptic efficacy in the hippocampus can be induced by different patterns of stimulation generating presynaptic and postsynaptic depolarization The theta burst stimulation of Schaffer collaterals can be sufficient to induce LTP by promoting the formation of filamentous actin in CA1 dendrites. Within the mammalian brain, some patterns of synaptic activity produce long-term potentiation (LTP) which is a long-lasting increase in synaptic strength and long-term depression (LTD) which is a long-lasting decrease in synaptic strength. LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses and \\"SK2 channel plasticity\\" Long-term plasticity in synapses of the hippocampus can be induced by different patterns of stimulation generating pre- and post-synaptic depolarization. These synaptic changes can clearly lead to modification in circuit function and to behavioral plasticity. Some patterns of synaptic activity produce an extensive increase in synaptic strength, also known as Long-Term Potentiation (LTP). In the hippocampus, LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 modulates the biophysical properties of AMPA receptors. Moreover, SK2, small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel, changes the shape of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) by coupling with N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDA receptors). The research by Lin MT, et al. was designed to investigate whether SK2 channels participate in synaptic changes when an activity-dependent decrease contributes to LTP. SK2 channels are ion channels that are activated by an increasing in the concentration of intracellular calcium and as a result of allowing K+ cation to cross the cell membrane. The double immunogold labeling identified that SK2 channels and NMDA cohabit within the postsynaptic density (PSD) of CA1 regions of the hippocampus. The authors used theta-burst pairing (TBP) to produce a rapid potentiation of synaptic strength and to evoke LTP that is induced simultaneously but whose expression levels vary inversely over time, and the result of the TBP induction was compared to the control group. The result showed that the TBP induction of LTP significantly increased EPSPs level. When the stimulus strength was reduced below the action potential threshold, apamin, a neurotoxin, was added to assess the contribution of SK2 activity to EPSPs. It resulted in an increase in the level of EPSPs with blockage of SK2 channels. The TBP induction of LTP abolishes SK2 channel contribution to EPSPs. When the induction of chemical LTP was applied, immunoparticles for SK2 were not found within the PSD of asymmetrical synapses. However, the SK2 immunoparticles were observed within intracellular membranes. The activation of protein kinase A (PKA) downregulates the surface expression of SK2 because PKA regulates the surface expression of AMPA receptors, a non-NMDA-type ionotropic transmembrane receptor, in the hippocampus. Therefore, PKA decreases the activity of LTP-dependent of SK2 channels. See Schaffer collateral#Long-term plasticity. =Short-term plasticity= Short-term synaptic plasticity undergoes important age-dependent changes that have crucial implications during the development of the nervous system. Vesicular release at \\"Schaffer Collateral\\" Transmitters are released from pre-synaptic terminals through fusion of vesicles to the membrane, that are filled with neurotransmitters such as glutamate. Vesicles are exocytosed, with neurotransmitters reentering the presynaptic terminal for reuse. These fused vesicles then reenter preferentially back into the rapidly recycling pool for reuse. Additional vesicles within the reserve pool of the presynaptic terminal are released according to stronger amplitude depolarizations of the presynaptic axon due to greater spatial or temporal summation of action potentials, corresponding to greater calcium influx polarizing. Rate of endocytosis is dependent on rate at which vesicles are recycled into the recycling pool. Multivesicular release (MVR) occurs at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses when P is elevated by facilitation and that MVR may be a phenomenon common to many synapses throughout the central nervous system.

Specifically, the muscle that causes abduction of the arytenoid cartilage, the cricoarytenoideus dorsalis muscle, ceases to function. This leads to inadequate ventilation during exercise and during thermoregulatory panting as well as incomplete protection of the airway during swallowing. One of the most common forms of laryngeal paralysis develops in geriatric medium to large breed dogs, in particular the Labrador retriever, but also some other breeds. This had been traditionally known as idiopathic largyngeal paralysis (\\"ILP\\": idiopathic means \\"of unknown cause\\"), and was believed to be a result of a condition affecting the nerves of the larynx (bilateral mononeuropathy of the recurrent laryngeal nerves). However investigations into ILP by two groups in Michigan and Tennessee between 2005 - 2013 showed that the condition was not limited to, or specifically a result of, dysfunction of the laryngeal nerves. Instead it was the most visible symptom of a slowly progressing polyneuropathy of old age, which also affected other nerves in the body. This finding, now generally believed correct following further research, has led to the proposed renaming of this type of laryngeal paralysis from \\"Idiopathic laryngeal paralysis\\" (\\"ILP\\") to \\"Geriatric onset laryngeal paralysis polyneuropathy\\" (\\"GOLPP\\"). Animals affected by laryngeal paralysis have reduced tolerance for exercise and heat and an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia. The condition is not generally regarded as causing pain, other than physical distress and anxiety caused by any difficulty in breathing or emotional distress from any difficulty with physical movement. Where laryngeal paralysis is related to a general progressive polyneuropathy, as in GOLPP, the nervous system will gradually degenerate causing increasing difficulty in management of the limbs (especially rear limbs), swallowing and breathing, and eventually in most cases euthanasia. Laryngeal paralysis is fairly common in large breed and geriatric dogs, particularly in the Labrador retriever, is rarely found in cats, and can also occur in horses where it is referred to as roaring, roarer's syndrome, or medically as laryngeal hemiplegia or recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN).Laryngeal paralysis in dogs and horses Laryngeal paralysis can be unilateral or bilateral depending upon dysfunction of one or both arytenoid cartilages. Causes In most cases, the cause of laryngeal paralysis is unknown or idiopathic. However, the disorder may arise secondary to general neuropathies, generalized neuromuscular diseases, muscular diseases, neoplasia either in the cervical (neck) region or the cranial mediastinum, or trauma. This acquired form occurs predominantly in middle-aged to old large breed or giant breed dogs such as the Labrador Retriever, golden retriever, Siberian Husky, Newfoundland, and St. Bernard. Usually these dogs are born with a normal larynx, but over time the nerves and muscles that control the laryngeal cartilages lose function. Laryngeal Paralysis by Katharine Hillestad, DVM. Laryngeal paralysis may also be congenital in some breeds (e.g. Bouvier des Flandres, Dalmatians, Siberian huskies, and bulldogs), appearing in dogs between two and six months of age. Affected puppies may have difficulty swallowing and breathing, they may gag frequently, and their bark often sounds abnormal. In Dalmatians it is part of another condition called 'laryngeal paralysis-polyneuropathy complex.' Affected puppies should not be used for breeding. Choke collars are not thought to be a significant risk factor for this disorder. However, after LP is diagnosed it is usually recommended to stop using a collar or anything else around the dog's neck and to switch to a harness instead. Signs Signs of laryngeal paralysis include voice change (the dog's bark becomes hoarse-sounding), gagging or coughing (often during or after eating or drinking), exercise intolerance, inspiratory stridor (noisy breathing on inspiration), difficulty breathing, and in severe cases cyanosis or syncope (fainting). Secondary problems may also occur, including aspiration or edema in the lungs, though often the problem remains an upper respiratory problem. Affected dogs are vulnerable to heat stroke and heat exhaustion due to their limited ability to cool themselves down by panting, but the disorder itself can be mistaken for heat stroke. Signs may occur at any time, but initially owners may only notice that their dog's bark sounds different, that their dog can't run as much as before, or that the dog has trouble in hot weather in unilateral cases because the unaffected side can compensate for the paralysed side. However most unilateral cases will eventually progress to include both sides of the larynx, a more serious problem with symptoms appearing more often. Signs are usually worse in hot and humid weather, during exercise, during times of stress or excitement, and in obese pets. Acute or late-stage symptoms are usually unmistakable and require immediate emergency treatment. Diagnosis This condition is usually diagnosed by direct examination of the larynx under light sedation, which also allows checking for benign or malignant tumors. Tests, such as thoracic radiographs, CT-scans, or echocardiography, are sometimes needed to rule out heart, lung, or mediastinal diseases or other possible causes of the symptoms often seen with LP. Some vets may also recommend running a thyroid profile since LP can be a symptom or complication of hypothyroidism. Treatment Mild cases are managed by limiting activity, keeping a healthy body weight, and avoiding exposure to high ambient temperatures. Mild sedatives can be used to decrease anxiety and panting and therefore improve respiration. Corticosteroids may also be administered in acute cases to decrease inflammation and edema of the larynx. Severe acute symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, hyperthermia, or aspiration pneumonia, must be stabilized with sedatives and oxygen therapy and may require steroid or antibiotic medications. Sometimes a tracheotomy is required to allow delivery of oxygen. Once the patient is stabilized, surgical treatment may be beneficial especially when paralysis occurs in both arytenoid cartilages (bilateral paralysis). The surgery (aretynoid lateralization, or a \\"laryngeal tieback\\") consists of suturing one of the aretynoid cartilages in a maximally abducted (open) position. This reduces the signs associated with inadequate ventilation (such as exercise intolerance or overheating) but may exacerbate the risk of aspiration and consequent pneumonia. Tying back only one of the aretynoid cartilages instead of both helps reduce the risk of aspiration. Afterwards the dog will still sound hoarse, and will need to be managed in the same way as those with mild cases of LP. Recent studies have found that many dogs with laryngeal paralysis have decreased motility of their esophagus. Animals with a history of regurgitation or vomiting should be fully evaluated for esophageal or other gastrointestinal disorders. Dogs with megaesophagus or other conditions causing frequent vomiting or regurgitation are at high risk for aspiration pneumonia after laryngeal tie-back. Permanent tracheostomy is an alternative surgical option for these dogs to palliate their clinical signs. Complications of surgical treatment Besides complications of surgery and anesthesia in general, there may be drainage, swelling, or redness of the incision, gagging or coughing during eating or drinking, or pneumonia due to aspiration of food or liquids. Undesirable complications are estimated to occur in 10-30% of cases. If medical therapy is unsuccessful and surgery cannot be performed due to concurrent disease (such as heart or lung problems) or cost, euthanasia may be necessary if the animal's quality of life is considered unacceptable due to the disease.

It is reputed to have been a seasonal campsite for local Gabrielino/Tongva Indians, who hunted in the area known to them as the Nopalera. In 1867, \\"Greek George\\" Caralambo, AKA Allen, received the parcel by federal patent in appreciation for his service in the US Army Camel Corps. Allen became famous by association when the bandit Tiburcio Vasquez was captured while hiding out at his home in 1874. Alfredo Solano, a prominent civil engineer, civic leader, symphony patron and one of the founders of the Los Angeles Athletic Club, purchased the canyon a year after Vasquez was hanged in 1876. Solano held the canyon as an investment before his widow, Ella Brooks Solano, sold the majority of the land to Carman Runyon in 1919. Runyon, having recently retired from a successful coal business in the East, came out with his new bride to enjoy the California climate. The marriage failed and Runyon moved to Hollywood where he met and married Ellen Hunt. The new Mrs. Runyon was an accomplished horsewoman and the Runyons purchased the canyon to use for riding and hunting. They built a small bungalow near the Fuller Avenue entrance. Runyon lent his name to the canyon, the road and Carman Crest Drive before he sold the estate in 1930 to John McCormack, the world-famed Irish tenor. McCormack had fallen in love with the estate whilst filming Song O' My Heart there in 1929. The film was an early \\"talkie\\" and McCormack's salary for the picture went to purchase the property and build the mansion he called \\"San Patrizio\\", after Saint Patrick. He and his wife lived in the mansion until they returned to England in 1938. Remains of terraced gardens and buildings can still be seen below the Vista gates. McCormack toured frequently and in his absence the mansion was often rented out to such celebrities as Janet Gaynor and Charles Boyer. The McCormacks made many friends in Hollywood, among them Errol Flynn, Will Rogers, John Barrymore, Basil Rathbone, C. E. Toberman and the Dohenys. After his farewell tour of America in 1937, the McCormacks deeded the estate back to Carman Runyon, expecting to return at a later date. World War II intervened, however, and, McCormack's health was broken by a wartime concert tour. McCormack died in 1945. In the meantime, Huntington Hartford, heir to the A&P; Grocery fortune and patron of the arts, purchased the property in 1942, moving into the mansion and renaming the estate \\"The Pines\\". He commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright and his son Lloyd Wright, who had offices in Hollywood, to draft ambitious plans for developing the estate. These included a \\"cottage hotel\\" lower canyon and a futuristic \\"play resort\\" country club on the ridge. When neighborhood opposition to the design put the project on hold, Hartford had Lloyd Wright design and build a pool pavilion on the crest of the hill at Inspiration Point, facing Hollywood. Schemes were later proposed for galleries in the canyon, but after 1955, Hartford began to spend more time in New York where his Gallery of Modern Art was eventually built. In the mid '40s, Hartford wrote an adaptation of \\"Jane Eyre\\" called \\"Master of Thornfield,\\" which ran for two weeks in Cincinnati and starred Errol Flynn as Mr. Rochester. This partnership led to Flynn staying in the pool-house briefly in 1957–58, and is the origin of a legend that \\"The Pines\\" was Flynn's estate. Ruins of old structures can still be found in the park. In 1964, Hartford offered the property as a gift to the city, but this was turned down by Mayor Sam Yorty. As Lloyd Wright recalled in 1977, \\"Here was this very wealthy man and he wanted to give something very stunning to Hollywood. The Chambers of Commerce, the hotel owners and the various businesses were jealous of the park, and with the help of the City officials, the City refused to give us permits. Hunt was so angry that he wanted to get out immediately and sold the property at a low price to [Jules] Berman, who then destroyed the mansion and let the place run down.\\" Jules Berman, who had made a fortune importing the well-known Mexican coffee-flavored liqueur Kahlúa, saw the estate potentially as a \\"Tiffany development, a beautiful subdivision of 157 luxury homes.\\" After purchasing the canyon, he razed San Patrizio and the guest houses to avoid paying taxes on the deteriorating structures. His \\"Huntington Hartford Estates\\" development, trading on the name of its famous former owner, encountered resistance led by Daniel deJonghe, a park activist. The project was stopped in 1978 before building could begin. The Lloyd Wright pool-house remained standing until 1972 when a fire in the canyon destroyed all but its natural stone foundations. Between 1994 and 1999, two parallel subway tunnels for the Metro Red Line were mined underneath the park. The tunnels run approximately from the southeast corner to the northwest corner of the park boundaries and are located deep underground.http://www.hatchmott.com/documents/adobe/Grouting%20of%20TBM%20Rock%20Tunnels%20for%20LA%20Subway.pdf The bench overlooking Los Angeles, featured near the end of the 1992 Seinfeld episode #42, titled \\"The Trip, Part 2\\", is located in the park; in 1998, singer Rozz Williams' ashes were scattered in the park after his suicide. In March 2007, The Trust for Public Land purchased of private land on Runyon Canyon for $8.75 million on behalf of the City of Los Angeles and the Mountains Recreation Conservation Authority. This ensured that the popular Runyon Canyon would remain open for public use and views unobstructed by development. Funding sources include: Los Angeles County Prop A, Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Prop 1, City of Los Angeles Prop K, Friends of Runyon Canyon, California Natural Resources Agency, EEMP, California Department of Parks and Recreation Stateside, and Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Walks and trails View towards Downtown Los Angeles from Inspiration Point There are five ways to enter Runyon Canyon: two gates at the bottom of the park in the south at Fuller and Vista Streets; a gate at the top of Runyon Canyon Road at Mulholland Drive on the north side of the park, a gate at northwest end of the park at Solar Drive by the trail on West Ridge, and a spine-ridge footpath from the top of Wattles Garden. The trailhead on Mulholland Drive has a parking area while the other trailheads rely on street parking. There are three routes to hike Runyon Canyon from the Fuller Gate—Runyon Canyon Road (easy), the Star Trail (medium), and the Hero Trail (difficult). Runyon Canyon Road is a gradual climb on a passably paved road, as one heads South to North towards the back of the Canyon. The Road swings around to the east ridge to the panoramic Clouds Rest and then comes down the medium-steep slope and famed railroad-tie steps of the Star Trail to the mid- level Inspiration Point, before taking the fire road past the run-down tennis court back down to the Fuller Gate. Doing this route in reverse back up Star Trail is a much more energetic climb up the steps and steep slopes between Inspiration Point and Clouds Rest. These loops take about 30–45 minutes. Some of the park's trails, including Runyon Canyon Road pictured here, were paved and improved during a water pipe replacement in 2016 The difficult route is the westernmost Hero's Trail which starts either just inside the secondary gates on Runyon Canyon Road (where dogs can be let off their leashes) or immediately to the left inside the Vista gate, and takes the hiker up an 18 degree slope and then along the spine of the ridge to the second highest point in the canyon with magnificent views to the West and South. This is a considerably more taxing climb than the previous routes described and is followed by a descent via either Runyon Canyon Road or the Star Trail, and will take between 45 and 60 minutes. Taking in Indian Rock will add another 10–20 minutes. Entering from Mulholland Drive, there are a couple of short hikes up Indian Rock to the highest point in the canyon with 360-degree views including the valley to the North. The alternative route follows the fire road round the rock and splits off towards the Western High Way or goes towards Clouds Rest and a choice of circuits. There is another lesser-known route through the bottom of the canyon which starts by the sharp bend in the lower fire road before you reach the tennis court. From here the walker can follow the path past the ruins and over the foundation slab (which is often used as a \\"ground canvas\\" for mosaic stone patterns or worded messages spelled out in arranged rocks) and then along what would once have been the river bed, and eventually emerge at the bend at the back of the canyon on Runyon Canyon Road before the final rise up to Clouds Rest. The last bit of this route is a bit of a scramble, and be prepared for cactus, overgrown bushes, insects, and possible snake encounters, but most of the rest of it is less strenuous than the climb between Inspiration Point and Clouds Rest. Directly opposite where this Lower Canyon Trail joins Runyon Canyon Road, there is another steep hike over the Middle Rock which comes out by the electricity pylon just south of Indian Rock, and to the right is another river bed walk, which brings the walker out just north of the Lloyd Wright house. The upper canyon trail is home to a variety of wildlife including birds, owls and hawks; snakes and lizards; and deer and coyote. Additionally, there are several hundred plant species throughout Runyon Canyon including black sage, elderberry, California sagebrush, wild buckwheat, golden yarrow, laurel sumac, scrub oak, sugar bush and toyon. Coyotes are often seen in the canyon at early morning and dusk, and have been known to take small animals. = Rock Mandala = The Rock Mandala is located in a quiet valley and is regularly maintained. The park is also home to the Rock Mandala, a piece of public artwork created in 2008 by resident and director Robert Wilson. The sculpture, a mandala of rocks, some up to 300lbs, is regularly maintained as a place to meditate and exercise. The Rock Mandala is located in a quiet valley off of the main trails in the park. Management and access The management of the ecosystem comprising Runyon Canyon Park and its surrounding residential neighborhood has been controversial since the park's opening in 1987. Although the park's Master Plan called for a small on-site parking lot (to relieve parking pressure on residential streets) and a small \\"experimental\\" dog park, the park opened before a parking lot was constructed, and the off-leash area was broadly expanded (to its current size) in 1994, resulting in greater popularity and visibility in print and online media. Increasing complaints by homeowners about parking, traffic, and health safety problems, particularly near its Mullholland and Vista Street entrances, led to unpopular parking restrictions on adjoining residential streets. In 2003, City Councilmember Tom LaBonge formed a volunteer Park Advisory Board comprising local residents and park visitors to make recommendations for addressing these and other issues. After a series of meetings, the Advisory Board recommended the closure of the Vista Street gate, dog-owner use fees to help pay for park upkeep and improvements, and abandonment of Recreation and Parks Department plans for an onsite 86-space parking lot. LaBonge shortly thereafter dissolved the Board in favor of \\"council representatives and city employees\\", and its recommendations were not implemented.http://www.laweekly.com/2004-08-12/news/it-s-dog-eat-dog-in- runyon-canyon-parking-ruckus/ Pelisek, C. \\"It's Dog Eat Dog in Runyon Canyon Parking Ruckus,\\" LA Weekly 8/12/2004 In 2009, LaBonge announced that plans for a parking lot were \\"on hold\\", and that the city was looking for \\"alternatives\\".Mikalian, A., \\"Runyon Canyon Parking Lot On Hold\\", LA Independent, 11/4/2009 See also *List of parks in Los Angeles ReferencesExternal links * Runyon Canyon Park at the Department of Parks and Recreation site * Information and photographs from the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy * Runyon Canyon Flickr Group * Daily Updates and Runyon Canyon Park Visitor Information Services Category:Hollywood Category:Landmarks in Los Angeles Category:Parks in Los Angeles ","title":"Runyon Canyon Park"},{"id":"2472964","text":"YPP is an initialism that may stand for: * Yohoho!

It is owned and operated by Bell Media. The studios and offices are located on Ouellette Avenue in Windsor while its transmitter is located south of Windsor. CIDR is one of only a few commercial adult album alternative stations in Canada and is the only one in Ontario, with the others located in British Columbia. CIDR was Canada's first AAA-formatted station at launch. HistoryCKLW-FM= The station was originally launched by Western Ontario Broadcasting in 1949 as CKLW-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1970 page B-237 It simulcast the CBC Dominion Network programming of sister station CKLW. CKLW-AM-FM dropped the CBC affiliation in 1950 with the sign-on of CBE, becoming the Metro Detroit network affiliate of the Mutual Broadcasting System. The stations were subsequently acquired in 1956 by a consortium including the American company RKO; RKO subsequently acquired full ownership of the stations in 1963. Also that year, CKLW-FM began airing distinct programming from its AM sister station. It originally broadcast two hours of separate programming each evening from 7 to 9 p.m., and in 1967, this was expanded to six hours per night (from 6 p.m. to midnight). =CKJY-FM/94 Fox FM= In 1970, due to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission's new rules on foreign ownership of Canadian media, RKO was forced to sell the stations to Baton Broadcasting. Under Baton's ownership, CKLW-FM had by 1973 completely separated programming from its successful Top 40 AM sister, airing a country music format with news and talk oriented toward the Windsor audience (as opposed to the AM, which chiefly targeted the American side). During the 1970s, CKLW-FM was known as FM Nine Four. In January 1982, the station changed its call sign to CKJY-FM, airing an adult standards and jazz format. In 1984, with CKLW's top 40 format on a decline due to the growing popularity of rock and pop music formats on the FM dial, management tried to move the AM's top 40 format to the FM dial with the new call sign CFXX-FM and the name 94 Fox FM. The station's staff spent months preparing for the change, commissioning new jingles, advertising extensively via billboards and television, and practicing the format until they were sure it was ready. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), however, refused to approve more than four hours of Top 40 programming a day - two in the morning and two in afternoon drive. The CRTC insisted that the station remain adult standards and jazz the rest of the time, holding that a repetitive format such as Top 40 belonged on AM and that FM was for non-hit music such as classical, jazz, big band and beautiful music. In 1985, Baton sold both CKLW and CFXX-FM to CUC Broadcasting, which moved the adult standards \\"Music of Your Life\\" format to 800 CKLW and instituted an easy listening format on the FM as CKEZ-FM. =Big 8 On FM/More 94= The call letters changed back to CKLW-FM in May 1986.Broadcasting Yearbook 1987 page B-342 The station instituted an oldies format meant to recapture the sound of the original CKLW (AM), with former \\"Big 8\\" DJ Dave Shafer as program director and morning show host. The new CKLW-FM brought back the well-known Johnny Mann Singers performing jingles for the \\"Big 8\\", along with many of the legendary personalities and \\"20/20 News.\\" The music rotation was based on the \\"Big 8\\" playlists from the 1960s to the 1980s plus some older 1950s and early 1960s hits that the AM had played as \\"golden\\" titles. \\"Ladies and gentlemen, the good times are back!\\" proclaimed former \\"Big 8\\" jock \\"Big\\" Jim Edwards during the station IDs. Although the overall sound was faithful to the \\"Big 8\\"'s glory days, the station's ratings remained low. Detroit already had a successful oldies station in WOMC. In 1988, CKLW-FM became CKMR-FM, known as More 94. The playlist was significantly reduced in its titles and the station became more tightly formatted. =I-94/The Legend/93-9 The River= After \\"More 94\\" failed to raise the station's ratings, CKMR-FM shifted in the fall of 1990 to an urban oldies/classic soul music format as I-94. Then, after only roughly four months, CKMR-FM switched to a Soft Adult Contemporary approach dubbed \\"The Motor City's Adult Music Station,\\" which lasted roughly six months. Then, the CKLW-FM call letters and the \\"Big 8\\"-inspired oldies format were once again restored around Labour Day of 1991, with the station branded as 93.9 The Legend. Once again, the station sounded faithful to the original CKLW, featuring stalwarts from the golden age of Detroit's Top 40 radio era such as Tom Shannon, Dave Prince, Dave Shafer and Lee Alan (host of the weekly feature Back in the '60s Again). Unfortunately, the change once again did nothing to raise the station's poor ratings. CHUM Limited acquired the station in early 1993, and initially kept the station as an oldies outlet. In February 1994, the format was switched to an \\"Arrow\\"-style classic hits format dubbed \\"Rock & Roll Oldies.\\" It mainly featured 1970s classic rock songs with a smattering of 1960s and 1980s material. On November 11, 1994, CKLW-FM flipped to adult album alternative as 93-9 The River - Quality Rock, Real Variety. The call letters were changed to CIDR- FM.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-11-25.pdf \\"The River\\" was never a ratings powerhouse. But, with Ann Delisi (formerly of Detroit public-radio station WDET) at the helm and Jeff \\"Zippy\\" Crowe in the mornings, The River attracted a loyal audience. The station then tweaked the format to \\"smooth rock\\" in 1999, adding many classic rock titles to the playlist. =\\"Lite Rock\\" and The \\"River's\\" Return= On August 25, 2000, the station flipped to a soft adult contemporary format as Lite Rock 93-9 FM in an attempt to take on AC market leader WNIC.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2000/RR-2000-09-01.pdf Ratings remained low, and eventually CIDR shifted its format in a hot adult contemporary direction by 2001, when WMGC-FM entered the Detroit AC competition. By the mid-2000s, the station dropped the \\"Lite Rock\\" identity from its on-air imaging and became known as simply 93.9 FM, Today's Best Music. The station now competed chiefly with WDVD, along with Leamington, Ontario's CHYR for the Hot AC audience. But as a Hot AC station, CIDR was still unsuccessful. At 3 p.m. on September 1, 2006, CIDR once again became 93.9 - The River. About three quarters of the way through the All American Rejects' \\"Move Along\\", the song was interrupted by the sound of rushing water, and a promo for the River was broadcast. It was also announced that the station would be playing clips of over 7,000 songs commercial free, all weekend long, until Monday morning, when the songs would be \\"Super sized\\". On September 4, 2006 at 8 a.m., \\"The River\\" was officially relaunched, with \\"Take Me to the River\\" by the Talking Heads being the first song played. This returned the adult alternative format back to the Detroit radio dial after public radio station WDET-FM dropped it in 2005 in favor of mainly NPR news and talk.. In 2007, CIDR along with all other CHUM Radio stations across Canada, were sold to CTVglobemedia. That company became Bell Media in April 2011, following BCE's purchase of CTVglobemedia. CIDR competes with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's \\"CBC Music Network.\\" In 2007 and 2008, it shifted from mostly classical music to an adult alternative sound most of the day. In Windsor, CBC Music airs on CBE-FM. Another competitor in the Ann Arbor market is Cumulus Media's WQKL, which also airs a triple-A format. In March 2011, Martz Communications Group (through licensee Radio Power, Inc.) filed an application with the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to relocate the frequency of its Detroit repeater, W284BQ, from 104.7 to 93.9 MHzFCC licensing data for W284BQ If approved, the repeater would interfere with CIDR- FM in much of the Greater Detroit area, though the licensee contends that the transmitter will be directional, not heard over the Canadian side of the border.FCC document: \\"Minor Change Application - Radio Power, Inc. - W284BQ FM Tranalator Station\\" Technical Statement, March 2011. However, Martz has since applied to move the translator to 93.5 FM, where it would not interfere with CIDR. In November 2011, the 104.7 FM signal went silent after having broadcast a smooth jazz format (simulcasting WGPR-HD2) for several months, having been ordered off the air by the FCC due to interference with WIOT in Toledo, Ohio. Furthermore, on January 31, 2012, Martz ceased operations of its HD feeds on WGPR, and the translators, due to financial and signal difficulties.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/55478/detroits-bone-oasis- go-dark/#.TyiGlZiqC70 References External links  *Michiguide.com - CIDR History * * Idr Idr Idr Category:RKO General Category:Radio stations established in 1948 Category:1948 establishments in Ontario ","title":"CIDR-FM"},{"id":"2472971","text":"An apical dendrite is a dendrite that emerges from the apex of a pyramidal cell. Apical dendrites are one of two primary categories of dendrites, and they distinguish the pyramidal cells from spiny stellate cells in the cortices. Pyramidal cells are found in the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex, the olfactory cortex, and other areas. Dendrite arbors formed by apical dendrites are the means by which synaptic inputs into a cell are integrated.Cline HT. Dendritic arbor development and synaptogenesis. Current Opinion in Neurobiology 2001; 11: 118–126 The apical dendrites in these regions contribute significantly to memory, learning, and sensory associations by modulating the excitatory and inhibitory signals received by the pyramidal cells.  Background  Two types of dendrites present on pyramidal cells are apical and basal dendrites. Apical dendrites are the most distal along the ascending trunk, and reside in layer 1. These distal apical dendrites receive synaptic input from related cortical as well as globally modulatory subcortical projections. Basal dendrites include shorter radially distributed dendrites which receive input from local pyramidal cells and interneurons.Henze DA CW, Barrioneuvo G. Dendritic Morphology and its effects on the amplitude and rise-time of synaptic signals in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells. Journal of Comparative Neurology. 1996;369:331–344. Pyramidal neurons segregate their inputs using proximal and apical dendrites.CL W. Dendritic Reorganization in Pyramidal Neurons in Medial Prefrontal Cortex after Chronic Corticosterone Administration. Journal of Neurobiology. 2001;49:245–253. Apical dendrites are studied in many ways. In cellular analysis, the electrical properties of the dendrite are studied using stimulus responses. A single surface shock of the cerebral cortex induces a 10–20 ms negative potential, a manifestation of the summed excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked in the distal portions of the apical dendrite.Jibiki I MK, Ohtani T, et al. Dendritic Potential in Direct Cortical Responses and Seizure Activity. Folia Psychiatrica et Neurologica. 1978;32(3):329–337 This has been called the Dendritic Potential (DP). This is identical with Adrian's Superficial Response in direct cortical responses. At higher intensities the DP is followed by slow positive waves (Adrian's Deep Response) or by a prolonged negative wave lasting for more than 200 ms (Chang’s second component). The highest amplitude of DPs is found on the cortical surface, with the polarity shifted from negative to positive within the superficial layer.  Areas of interest  Hippocampus = The hippocampus contains pyramidal neurons in three areas: CA1, CA2, and CA3. The pyramidal neurons of each area have different properties. However, in all areas, dendritic synthesis of proteins is necessary for late long-term potentials in the hippocampal neurons.Bradshaw KD EN, Bliss TVP. SHORT COMMUNICATION: A role for dendritic protein synthesis in hippocampal late LTP. European Journal of Neuroscience. 2003;18:3150–3152 Neurons throughout the limbic system are known to have \\"burst\\" properties. These cells undergo synchronous and paroxysmal depolarizations, firing short sequences of action potentials called bursts. The stratum oriens is the location between layers containing basal dendrites. The stratum lucidum, stratum radiatum, and the stratum moleculare-lacunosum are layers of apical dendrites and are ordered from least distant to most distant from the soma of the neuron. Pyramidal cells in CA3 CA3 projects Schaffer collaterals to apical dendrites in CA1. Individual pyramidal cells in the CA3 region have burst properties due to high densities of calcium channels in their proximal dendrites.Jerome Engel TAP, ed. Epilepsy: A Comprehensive Textbook in Three Volumes. Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2008 Depolarization of the membrane may also trigger these bursts. Calcium entry into the cell causes more prolonged depolarization and increased action potentials. Usually curtailed by the hyperpolarizing local inhibition (due to the excitatory collateral system), this can lead to gradual recruitment of CA3 neurons and result in synchronized burst discharges. After hyperpolarization by calcium-dependent potassium conductance is also used as a method of controlling these bursts. Hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells have complex dendritic arbors which receive a stratified pattern of synaptic input from a variety of sources, including: #the commissural/associational fibers from ipsi- and contra-lateral CA3 pyramidal neurons which synapse on both the basal and mid-apical dendrites in the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum #the mossy fibers from the granule cells of the dentate gyrus which synapse on the most proximal apical region, the stratum lucidum #the preforant path fibers from the entorhinal cortical pyramidal cells which synapse in the region of the most distal apical dendrites, the stratum lacunosum-moleculare. Distal apical dendrites extend upwards from the soma. The shorter proximal apical dendrites extend outward and below. Shape of majority of 2d section is approximately a cylinder with a pointed base for the apical arbor. The apical dendrites and basal dendrites possess a radial organization pattern as they extend from the soma. Proximal apical dendrites and basal dendrites have approximately the same density. Apical dendrites possess a larger average total dendritic length (6332 vs 5062 micrometres) and surface area (12629 vs 9404 square micrometres; neither includes spines). However, the number of terminal branches for both apical and basal dendrites appear to be similar. Distances between successive branch points are shorter for basal dendrites. The basal dendrite however has approximately 3 fold fewer endings per primary dendrite. This and the lower maximum branch order suggest lower complexity than apical dendritic trees. Basal dendrites have a shorter distance to the tips and a more restricted range than apical dendrites. Data suggests that proximal apical and basal dendrites are more compressed but offer a wider local range of activity than distal apical dendrites. In CA3 neurons the inputs are stratified and run in bands parallel to the cell body layer. Dendritic attenuation of synaptic current is described by an exponential relationship. The closer to the body the dendrite, the higher the EPSP amplitude. Electrical measurements and predictions validate the cylinder cross-section model. In the CA3, the temporoammonic (TA), commissural (COM), associational (ASSOC), and mossy fiber (MF) afferents all make excitatory glutamatergic (Glu) synapses on pyramidal cell dendrites (both apical and basal). Since fast signals occurring in the basilar and proximal apical dendrites are transferred to the soma with at least a 20–25% efficiency, synapses in these dendrites each contribute more to the neuronal activation than distal apical synapses. In contrast, only slow signals from the distal dendrites are efficiently transferred to the soma, suggesting a modulatory role on the resting potential of the cell. It is hypothesized in several studies that this could be accomplished by varying the overall frequency of synaptic activity in the distal apical dendrite. Since a constant barrage of synaptic activity would approximate a constant current injection, the overall level of synaptic activity in the distal apical dendrite could set the depolarization level of the entire neuron. When a more efficient proximal synaptic activity is superimposed upon a sub-threshold depolarization due to distal activity, the cell has a high probability of firing an AP. In CA3, it is the perforant path projection from the entorhinal cortical cells that provides synaptic input to the most distal dendrites of the pyramidal cells. Assuming a frequency average of 7 spikes/sec, as few as five randomly firing entorhinal cortical cells would cause a steady level of depolarization in the distal dendrites of CA3b pyramidal cells. Amplitude and kinetics of the electrical signal vary as a function of position within the dendrite and signal frequency. The major trigger for CA3 discharge is the afferent input from the dentate gyrus granule cells, from which mossy fiber terminals create very complex synapses on the proximal part of the CA3 apical dendrite in the stratum lucidum. Here they contact very complex dendritic spines. Glutamate release from single terminals evokes a large non-NMDA mediated EPSP. The most proximal regions of CA3 pyramidal dendrites receive mossy fiber input exclusively, mid-dendritic regions (strata radiatum on the apical side and the oriens on the basal side) receive principally associational and Commissural fibers (from other CA3 cells), and the distal apical dendrites (stratum lacunosum-moleculare) receive input from the temproammonic afferents (from the entorhinal cortex). Mossy fiber input to CA3 exhibits different plasticity than that of typical long term potentiation because it is dependent on (or at least sensitive to) monoaminergic (see monoamine) activation of the cAMP 2nd messenger system. Interneurons in CA3 These are similar to dentate cells. Interneuron cell types show unique dendritic arborization patterns and region specific targeting by axon collaterals. Investigators have shown that different morphologically defined interneurons show different electrical properties. These include both fast-spiking cells whose inhibitory post- synaptic potentials (IPSPs) sum to create small, smooth IPSPs in pyramidal cells and slow spiking cells (these produce large, fast-rising IPSPs in the pyramidal cell target). The dendritic region of CA3 is laminated. For the input to the hippocampus proper, the temporoammonic pathway arises in layer III cells of the entorhinal cortex but separates from the perforant pathway to contact the most distal branches of the pyramidal cells in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA1-CA3. The excitatory (glutaminergic) influence of this path has been questioned because influence on the pyramidal cells has been difficult to demonstrate. Recent experiments show that this modulation of pyramidal cells may differentially activate an interneuron subpopulation located in the distal reaches of the apical dendrites. The study of inhibitory transmission is limited in the pyramidal neurons and their modulators because the large number of excitatory synapses has overshadowed physiological studies of the inhibitory neurons.Mathews, Gregory. Telephone Interview.11/19/08. The structure of inhibitory synapses on apical dendrites may not be as plastic as the excitatory synapses on these neurons. There is difficulty in differentiating the excitatory and inhibitory synapses using the electrophysiological recordings in many experiments. The excitatory synapses and their patterns are by comparison to the inhibitory system rather uniform in type and properties. The inhibitory system, by contrast, possess several (10) different types of synapses originating from specifically differentiated cells and are much more difficult to track. There is insufficient information to precisely distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory pathways contributing to the alterations in neurotransmitter expression and cell structure changes.  CA1  CA1 pyramidal cells make up a homogeneous population which together with relatives in subiculum comprise the primary output cells of the hippocampal formation. Primary excitatory inputs are via glutamatergic CA3 Schaffer collaterals (both ipsi- and contralateral), which contact dendritic spines on the apical and basal dendrites in strata radiatum and oriens. Additional excitatory input is via the temporoammonic system which synapses on distal apical dendrites in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare. Imaging studies following localized changes intracellular calcium from discrete synaptic inputs have shown a role for these currents in synaptic plasticity. There is disagreement, however, as to how activity-dependent changes in synaptic inhibition might occur. Studies do agree that plasticity is enhanced when inhibition is reduced.  CA2  CA2 differs from other regions because it is one of the few areas to survive Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. Kainic acid, used to model TLE and related scleroses, affects primarily the mossy fiber synapses in CA3. It is thought that at these release glutamate with administration of KA. CA2 and CA3 can be distinguished using histological stains because the proximal apical dendrites of CA2 do not possess dendritic spines. =Entorhinal cortex= The entorhinal cortex (EC) is composed of six layers. Superficial layer I consists largely of afferent fibers onto the apical dendrites of the cells in layers II-VI. Caudal levels project strongly to rostral levels. Within each EC area, deeper layers innervate superficial layers, with superficial layers innervating adjacent superficial layers. Entorhinal pyramidal cells of layer V receive strong input from the perirhinal cortex and sensory cortices. These pyramidal cells then project into the superficial entorhinal layer II and III cells. Layer V EC cells have strong recurrent excitatory synapses much like CA3 layers in the hippocampus and when provoked are capable of burst activity. Medial to lateral entorhinal area connections are sparse and principally project from the medial EC to the lateral EC. These connections are not reciprocal. The majority of cells in the EC are pyramidal. More than 90% of layer V cells are regular spiking, with only a few burst-firing and fast-spiking cells. GABA is strong in superficial layers. Horizontal slice tissue preparations of both EC and hippocampus tissues show that exposure to low magnesium ion concentrations produces protracted seizure events. This response is likely a result of the interconnections of layer V pyramidal cells. Increases in extracellular potassium in seizures are seen in deeper layers. These responses are accurate reflections of in-vivo animal models. = Piriform cortex = In the piriform cortex, layer I consists mostly of afferent inputs to apical dendrites of deeper cells. Layer I is subdivided into layers Ia and Ib each having its own afferents. Layer II is densely packed with pyramidal and semilunar cells. Layer III contains mostly pyramidal cells in its superficial part. In the piriform cortex the distal apical dendrites of layer III pyramidal neurons receive extrinsic inputs, which the corresponding proximal dendrites receive intrinsic inputs. = Olfactory bulb = In each glomerulus the axons of the receptor neurons contact the apical dendrites of mitral cells, which are the principal projection neurons in the olfactory bulb. Cell bodies of mitral cells are located in a distinct layer deep in the olfactory glomeruli.Dale Purves GJA, David Fitzpatrick, William C. Hall, Anthony-Samuel LaMantia, James O. McNamara, and S. Mark Williams, eds. Neuroscience: Third Edition. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates, Inc.; 2004 Each mitral cell extends a primary dendrite to a single glomerulus, where the dendrite gives rise to an elaborate tuft of branches onto which the primary olfactory axons synapse. Each glomerulus in the mouse model, for example, contains approximately 25 mitral cells which receive innervation from approximately 25,000 olfactory receptor axons. The convergence increases the sensitivity of mitral cells to odor detection. = Cerebral cortex = General  The most superficial layer of the cortex is the molecular or plexiform layer.Greenstein BGaA. Color Atlas of Neuroscience: Neuroanatomy and Neurophysiology. Stuttgart, New York: Thieme; 2000 It has a dense network of tangentially oriented fibers and cells made of axons of martinotti cells and stellate cells, as well as apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. Apical dendrites from pyramidal cells in the external granular layer and more prominently the external pyramidal layer project into the molecular layer. There are also in the plexiform layer GABAergic synaptic connections between the apical dendrites of granular cells and the basal dendrites of the tufted cells and mitral cells. Some of the apical dendrites from the pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex may be up to 10μm in diameter.Smith CUM. Elements of Molecular Neurobiology. 3rd ed. Chichester, West Sussex England: John Wiley & Sons Ltd; 2002. The apical dendrite of a large pyramidal neuron in the cerebral cortex may contain thousands of spines. Spines in the cerebral cortex vary in size by several orders of magnitude from one region to another. Smallest have a length of 0.2μm and a volume of about 0.04 cubic micrometres and the largest a length of 6.5μm and a volume of 2 cubic micrometres.  Neocortex  Pyramidal cells are the majority class of cells in the neocortex. They have high density of dendritic spines, prominent apical dendrites, and axons that project out of the cortex as well as locally within it. Soma for these appear in all layers except I. Spiny stellate cells are distinguished from pyramidal cells here by the absence of the apical dendrite and the fact that their axons also do not leave the cortex. These cells are thought to begin as pyramidal neurons and then retract their apical dendrites and axons. = Cerebellum = A defining characteristic of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum is the apical dendrite.  Development  Dendritic arbor formation for pyramidal neurons in the cortices occurs progressively beginning in late embryonic stages of development and extending well into post-natal periods. Many dendrites of pyramidal neurons in deep layers branch and form connections in layer IV, while some extend to more superficial layers. Pyramidal cell dendrites in layer III branch to form arbors in layer I. Thalamocortical afferents will make synaptic contact with dendrites in layer IV while myriad of other inputs will meet dendrites in layer I. The post-synaptic structure is driven in part by signals from incoming afferent fibers and through life there is plasticity in the synapses. The formation of these arbors is regulated by the strength of local signals during development. Several patterns in activity control the development of the brain. Action potential changes in the retina, hippocampus, cortex, and spinal cord provide activity-based signals both to the active neurons and their post-synaptic target cells. Spontaneous activity originating within neuronal gap junctions, the cortex sub-plate, and sensory inputs are all involved in the cell signaling that regulates dendrite growth. Useful models of dendritic arbor formation are the Xenopus tadpoles, which are transparent in early stages of larval development and allow for dye-labeled neurons to be repeatedly imaged in the intact animal over several weeks. It has been observed from this and other models that there are rapid dendritic branch additions and retractions which lengthen the overall dendrite and accumulate more branches. This mirrors the development of axonal branches (both have a lifetime of approximately 10min). This activity decreases as neurons mature. Signals including glutamate from axon branches may increase branch additions. Within the Xenopus tadpole model, several signaling systems have been studied. For example, in optical tectal neurons, dendrite arbor growth occurs approximately at the onset of retinal input. Many on the caudal tectate have “silent” synapses which are modulated only by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. As neurons mature, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole (AMPA) receptors are added, increasing synaptic transmission. Neuron and dendrite development are NMDA dependent. Rapidly growing dendrite arbors are more dynamic than slowly growing ones and dendrites themselves play an active role in their own development. It has been shown in studies that transport of HCN (hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide) gated channel isoforms to dendritic fields of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus occurs in an age- specific manner in the developing hippocampus.Bender RA BA, and Baram TZ. Neuronal Activity Influences the sub-cellular distribution of hyperpolarization-activated cation channels in hippocampal neurons. Epilepsia. 2005;46(supplement 8):92 Among the signals studied in this system is CaMKII a calcium/calmodulin-regulated serine/threonine kinase which is required for induction by not expression of long-term potentiation. CaMKII mRNA is targeted to dendrites and both protein synthesis and enzyme activity are increased by strong synaptic input. Expression in Xenopus indicates that it is associated with the transition to slowed arbor growth. This suggests that activity promotes the reduction of dendrite branch growth and retraction, stabilizing the arbor configuration. The following pattern emerges for this system: #Branches with NMDA-only receptors mature and recruit AMPARs, which stabilize the branches. #These stable branches then add new branches with NMDAR-only synapses which either stabilize through AMPARs or retract. AMPAR additions are present in adults and account for synaptic plasticity. #CaMKII strengthening of signals results from the selective trafficking of GluR1 AMPARs into synapses. In long term depression (LTD) the GluR subunits of AMPARs undergo endocytosis. Temporal differences in signaling over the course of neuron maturation suggest that the most promising studies of arbor development and synaptogenesis in the future are going to occur in intact brain systems. Another model studied in apical dendrite development is the rat. Injection of tetanus toxin into neonatal rats has shown that growth of apical dendrites occurs normally during signal deprivation while basal dendrite growth is restricted. This indicates that neural activity is critical to new dendrite formation.Groc L PZ, Gustafsson B, et al. In vivo blockade of neural activity alters dendritic development of neonatal CA1 pyramidal cells. European Journal of Neuroscience. 2002;16:1931–1938. However, animal models may be insufficient to elucidate the complexity of these systems. Pyramidal cells in CA1, for example, are 30 times as thick in humans as they are in rats. The entorhinal cortex is also subdivided into as few as 8 and as many as 27 sections in humans (depending on the system used), whereas there are only 2 in rats and 7 in monkeys.Anderson P MR, Amaral D, Bliss T, and O'Keefe J, ed. The Hippocampus Book: Oxford University Press. The connections of the dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex are also more sophisticated in humans. In rats and cats, a very large reciprocal connection exists between the entorhinal cortex and the olfactory system. In primates this connection is absent and there are highly differentiated connections between the multimodal parasensory and paralimbic cortices and the EC which are not as evident in rats and cats. The increased size of the primate subiculum may proportionally enhance its effects on the entorhinal cortex.  Sexual dimorphism  Pyramidal cell dendritic arbor formation in the anterior cingulate cortex (layers 2/3) is more complex in males and, in contrast the orbital prefrontal regions, dendritic arborization is greater in females suggesting a fundamental difference in the prefrontal organization in males and females. In rats, for example, exposure to estrogen either exogenously or endogenously during proestrous leads to increases in CA1 spine densities. These differences may be due to the presence of gonadal hormones which have been demonstrated to influence cell structure in the hippocampus. Treatment with testosterone has been shown to affect cortical neuron structure.  Pathology Stress response and PTSD= Dendritic spines, post-synaptic structures receiving mainly excitatory input, are sensitive to experiences in development including stress episodes or drugs. Studies have shown that prenatal stress reduces complexity, length, and spine frequency of layer II/III pyramidal apical dendrites in rat and primate models. Dendritic atrophy has been described in hippocampal formation and prefrontal cortex in both models.Murmu MS SS, Biala Y, et al. Changes of spine density and dendritic complexity in the prefrontal cortex in offspring of mothers exposed to stress during pregnancy. European Journal of Neuroscience. 2006;24:1477–1487. Chronic stress has been shown to reduce the arbor complexity and total dendritic length of apical dendrite trees of CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus as well.McKittrick CR MA, Blanchard DC, et al. Chronic Social Stress Reduces Dendritic arbors in CA3 of Hippocampus and Decreases Binding to Serotonin Transporter Sites. Synapse. 2000;36:85-942006;24:1477-1487.Reith MEA, ed. Cerebral Signal Transduction: From First to Fourth Messengers. Totowa, NJ: Humana Press, Inc.; 2000. Chronic stress-induced changes in behavior have usually been attributed to changes in the hippocampus which is a primary neural target of glucocorticoids and is involved in many of the behaviors altered by corticosteroid administration. Both chronic stress and corticosteroid administration result in extensive atrophy of apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA3, and these dendrites do not atrophy when cyanoketone (a corticosteroid blocker) is given. This dendrite atrophy is mediated by both glutaminergic and serotonergic systems (administration of either NMDA receptor antagonist CGP 43487 or serotonin uptake inhibitor tianeptine prevents atrophy). Cell death has been reported to prolonged treatment. Stress hormones in small doses do not themselves cause damage but magnify effects of other dangerous agents, including excitotoxins, hypoglycemia, hypoxia and ischemia. Damaging effects of stress in these neurons are thought to be related to expression of brain- derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the expression of which is reduced in stressed conditions and increased with the administration of anti-depressants. The prefrontal cortex is also a target for the glucocorticoids in stress ([3H]dexamethasone binds to receptors in frontal and prefrontal cortex at about 75% of concentration of hippocampus). Endogenous regulation of corticosteroid receptors is indicated by altered binding of the previously mentioned compound in the prefrontal cortex with administration of corticosteroids. Furthermore, regulation of stress activities involves the prefrontal cortex. Lesions in rat prefrontal cortices impair spontaneous alternation, radial maze performance, and passive avoidance. In primates these impair inhibition of line-of-sight responses. Chronic administration of corticosteroids decreases 5-HT1A receptor binding, 5-HT2 receptor binding, serotonin levels, and expression of neural cell adhesion molecule (a cell- surface macromolecule involved in regulating aspects of synapse stabilization). These changes indicate structural change follows stress hormone elevation. Studies of dendritic morphological changes indicate that elevation of stress hormones in layer II-III of the prefrontal cortex causes no observable change in the structure or distribution of basal dendrites. The apical dendrites, however, show a significant redistribution in stress-hormone treated animal brains, which is measured using Scholl analysis. Scholl analysis estimates the amount and distributions of dendrite material by counting numbers of intersections of dendrites with an overlay of concentric rings centered at the soma. Medial prefrontal cortex layer II-III pyramidal neurons showed significant reorganization with a 21% increase in proximal apical dendrite arbors and a decrease of 58% in distal apical dendrite arbors. These results are in contrast to the changes in the hippocampal CA3 dendritic arbors, in which only regressive changes were observed. One possible explanation proposed in these studies is that the atrophy of distal dendrites in II-III layer pyramidal neurons results directly from the loss of input from changed CA3 pyramidal neurons, as both CA1 and CA3 project directly into the medial prefrontal cortex. It has been determined from electrophysiological data that excitatory synapses on proximal apical dendrites of prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons serve to amplify excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) signals generated in distal apical dendrites. This suggests that reduction in distal dendrite mass due to the stress hormone elevation may result in an increase in proximal apical dendrite complexity as the proximal apical dendrites attempt to offset the reduced distal apical dendrite signals. Serotonergic alterations and alterations in glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex indicate that the neurochemical mechanisms altering structure in both the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are similar. The division of management between extrinsic and intrinsic inputs to the dendrites in the piriform cortex (mentioned above) is also seen to a lesser degree in the medial prefrontal cortex. This indicates that stress-induced changes to apical dendrites increase the relative emphasis of intra-cortical signals at the expense of extra-cortical signals. In studies of hierarchical animals, it was observed that the dominant and subordinate animals show the same degree of dendritic reorganization, indicating that the dendritic atrophy with stress is not degree-dependent. = Metabolic disease = In neurometabolic diseases, distended storage neurons are markedly swollen and pear shaped, with the nucleus and the nissl bodies displaced toward the apical dendrites.Haberland C. Clinical Neuropathology: Text and Color Atlas. New York, NY: Demos Medical Publishing, LLC; 2007. Examples of neuron metabolic storage diseases are the sphingolipid storage diseases which typically involve malfunctioning hydrolases in the lysosomes responsible for the degradation of these lipids: #type 2 and type 3 Gaucher diseaseBuccoliero A BJ, and Futerman AH. The role of sphingolipids in neuronal development: lessons from models of sphingolipid storage diseases. Neurochemical Research. 2002;27(7/8):565-574 #GM1 gangliosidosis and GM2 gangliosidosis This swelling is shown, for instance, in Tay–Sachs disease, a GM2 accumulation due to defective beta-hexosaminidase. Visible in this disorder are large mega-neurite formations. = Epilepsy = Cellular mechanisms  It has been indicated that there is a \\"chicken and egg\\" issue in the study of models relating to epilepsy because on the one hand the models are used to study the genesis of epilepsy and on the other they are used to study changes in prolonged events. The question arises, therefore, of whether the resulting data of the models indicated an exaggerated defect responsible for the genesis of seizures or whether the data indicated systemic changes to normal tissue after prolonged seizure activity. Calcium currents, normally prominent in CA1 hippocampal neurons are increased in response to status epilepticus. There is evidence that current in T-type calcium channels is increased specifically in apical dendrites. The hypothesis is that this phenomenon creates a situation in which fast sodium spikes in the soma back-propagate into the dendrites, whereby they detonate bursting.Dudek FE RM. Current opinions in clinical science: calcium currents burst back: a possible role for dendrites in eliptogenesis. Epilepsy Currents. 2007;7(5):140–141. Dendritic potentials (DPs) also undergo changes. Elicitation of DPs during seizure activity showed that they were much smaller than controls. However, DPs elicited just after seizure termination lasted for longer periods, indicating that suppression of the DP is correlated with the seizure activity itself. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter capable of causing a metabolic injury to neurons. In the hippocampus, GABAergic neurons have been found vulnerable to excitotoxic action of glutamate at the kainate receptor.Benes FM TM, and Kostoulakos P. GluR5,6,7 Subunit Immunoreactivity on Apical Pyramidal Cell Dendrites in Hippocampus of Schizophrenics and Manic Depressives. Hippocampus. 2001;11:482–491. These receptors are most dense in sectors CA3 and CA2 of the hippocampus, where nanomolar (nM) concentrations of kainic acid have been associated with pronounced and persistent depolarization of CA3 pyramidal neurons. This involving the conduction of excitatory activity along the mossy fiber projections from the area dentate granule cells to the CA3 neurons. Stimulation of this receptor type has been associated with paroxysmal spikes similar to seizures. Plasticity in CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons has been related to CA1 roles in epileptogenesis. CA1 is hyperexcitable when the CA3 region is damaged. Reduction of both GABAA and GABAB IPSPs occurs. GABA interneurons, though intact, become less easily activated. Seizure input from the EC to the dentate gyrus is filtered for both ictal and normal activity patterns, while CA3 cells impose an inter-ictal profile, reinforcing abnormal activity. Hyperventilation leads to a marked surface negative direct current shift due to depolarization of the apical dendritic trees of the cortical pyramidal cells. This shift is likely to represent the increased excitability of the cortical neuronal networks and may explain the resultant potential epileptogenicity. Certain anti-epileptic drugs have the opposing effect of reducing surface negativity in normal controls.  Temporal lobe epilepsy  Changes in expression of potassium channels and of potassium currents have been described in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. In this model, there is downregulation of the A-type encoding Kv4.2 channel. This channel is involved in limiting backpropagation of action potentials and in reducing the transfer of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) from apical dendrites into the soma. In the same model, the aforementioned upregulation of t-type calcium channels also has been shown to result in increased burst behavior in neurons in the hippocampus.  Infantile seizures and associated memory impairment  Neuronal death does not appear to contribute to the learning deficits in rats with infant seizures. CA3 neurons in the tetanus toxin model of early onset epilepsy, however, show a reduction in the branching complexity of basal dendrites as well as a decrease in the spine density on both the apical dendrites and the basal dendrites. Similar data have been taken from epileptic human patients during surgical procedures. In neocortical and hippocampal foci, a decrease in length and branching complexity of dendritic arbors and a reduction in the branching complexity of the remaining dendrites were observed. The chronic alumina cream model of epilepsy in primates has produced similar data. Because dendrites and their spines are sites of excitatory synaptic input onto neurons, the results suggest that the glutaminergic synaptic transmission may be reduced. As these are sites active in long-term potentiation (LTP) and other alterations in synaptic transmission that underlie learning and memory, changes at these sites could explain learning and memory deficits associated with both early-onset and long-term epilepsy. = Schizophrenia = In individuals with schizophrenia, post-mortem analysis has indicated a decrease of GABAergic cells and activity in the hippocampus. = Human neocortical heterotopia = Heterotopia is the displacement of any organ or component thereof from its natural position. Rat models of telencephalic internal structural heterotopia are used as a model for human neocortical heterotopia. In these models, the apical dendrites of the pyramidal neurons are not consistently radially oriented and may even be inverted. Additionally, the dendrites near the edge of the heterotopic region often bend and follow the contour of the band.  Methods of studying effects  The following list is adapted from Lothman, et al.Lothman EW BE, and Stringer JL. Functional Anatomy of Hippocampal Seizures. Progress in Neurobiology. 1991;37:1–82. = In-vivo imaging = #Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) #Computerized tomography (CT) #Positron emission tomography (PET) #Film autoradiography #Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) #Surface, subdural, and depth electroencephalography #Magnetoencephalography #Evoked potentials #Focal electrical stimulation #Afterdischarges #Physiological, psychological responses to stimulation #Single unit recording = In-vitro physiology = #Slices #In-vitro imaging: standard light and electron microscopy #Histochemistry #Immunocytochemistry #Receptor autoradiography #Lesions ##Destructive ##Reversible ##Cryolesions #Pharmacological = Seizure changes = Two methods are studying the relationship between seizures and dendritic impairment: # Seizures activate stress mechanisms including the excitatory neuropeptide corticotropin- releasing hormone (CRH) from hippocampal neurons. CRH has been shown to interfere with dendritic growth and differentiation. Mice lacking this receptor possess exuberant dendritic trees. However, pyramidal cells exposed to CRH during the first week of life had atrophied dendrites. These stress- related changes reduced synaptic plasticity and caused learning and memory deficits later in life. As antagonists for CRH exist, there exists a potential to reverse or prevent these effects through pharmacological means. # Studies of recurrent febrile seizures have shown that seizures resulted in impaired learning and memory but also disrupted signaling that normally results in activation of cAMP response element binding factor (CREB), a transcription factor. For rats tested in the inhibitory avoidance learning paradigm, normally an activation of CREB occurs by phosphorylation at Ser133. This activation is impaired following recurrent febrile seizures. A seizure-induced modification of a signaling cascade upstream of CREB is suggested by this. Adult rats with infant febrile seizures were treated with Rolipram, a specific phosphodiesterase type IV inhibitor (PDE4 inhibitor), which resultes in the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and is known to activate CREB by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Rolipram treatment reversed the learning deficits in rats that had experienced recurrent febrile seizures. = Optical monitoring = Recording the activity of a single neuron at any given time at many locations in the dendritic tree has been accomplished using voltage-sensitive dyes with optical monitoring. Signals are rapid but also small, and measurements from single cells require intense illumination. As the dyes are very phototoxic, the cells usually die after only a few action potentials. However, measurements from both somatic and dendritic patch recordings show that the peak membrane potential deflection during a paroxysmal depolarizing shift (PDS) is 10mV greater in the apical trunk (supragranular location) than the soma. This is consistent with the anatomy of neocortical networks because the most powerful reciprocal layer connections are in supragranular layers 2 and 3. This may resolve the conflicting information suggesting that the activity spreads primarily at the supragranular layers or at the large layer 5 neurons. Conventional studies with electron microscopy or Golgi stains portrayed dendrites as stable structures.Wong M. Modulation of dendritic spines in epilepsy: cellular mechanisms and functional implications. Epilepsy & Behavior. 2005;7:569–577. However, time-lapsed photography and two-photon microscopy have revealed dendrites as living, constantly changing tissues which are motile on a rapid time scale. = Electroencephalogram = Electroencephalogram (EEG) scalp signals are summed EPSPs and IPSPs of nerve cells.Zani A PA, ed. The Cognitive Electrophysiology of Mind and Brain; 2002 EEG can only measure the potentials of cells arranged in organized layers and whose apical dendrites are oriented perpendicularly to the surface of the cortex (as they are in pyramidal cells). The potential measured by the EEG is the difference between the basal and apical parts of the active neurons that are oriented in such a way. The EPSPs that converge on the pyramidal neurons through direct afferent fibers ending in the upper part of the apical dendrites cause a flow of charged ions (a current) between points at different potentials within and outside neurons. The positive ions then enter the cell following concentration and electrical charge gradient and propagate to the rest of the neuron. EPSPs from the distal apical dendrites create a current starting from the apical part nearest to the synapse (where the magnitude is greater) toward the cell body because the resistance to this flow is less. The current perpendicular (or radial) to the apical dendrite is accompanied by a magnetic field that propagates orthogonally (or tangentially) to the current along the extracellular side of the cell membrane. This set of ionic and electrical functional alterations thus generates the fields of electromagnetic potentials or electromagnetic dipoles. These can be defined also as single equivalent dipoles.

Due to their direct attachment to the cell body itself, basal dendrites are able to deliver strong depolarizing currents and therefore have a strong effect on action potential output in neurons. The physical characteristics of basal dendrites vary based on their location and species that they are found in. For example, the basal dendrites of humans are overall found to be the most intricate and spine-dense, as compared to other species such as Macaques. It is also observed that basal dendrites of the prefrontal cortex are larger and more complex in comparison to the smaller and simpler dendrites that can be seen within the visual cortex. Basal dendrites are capable of vast amounts of analog computing, which is responsible for many of the different nonlinear responses of modulating information in the neocortex. Basal dendrites additionally exist in dentate granule cells for a limited time before removal via regulatory factors. This removal usually occurs before the cell reaches adulthood, and is thought to be regulated through both intracellular and extracellular signals. Basal dendrites are part of the more overarching dendritic tree present on pyramidal neurons. They, along with apical dendrites, make up the part of the neuron that receives most of the electrical signaling. Basal dendrites have been found to be involved mostly in neocortical information processing.  Dendritic arbor  Basal dendrites are part of sampling dendritic arbors. These arbors are classified as sampling because they are not completely space filling, but make more than one specific, or selective connection. For example, at the CA1 pyramidal cell of a rat, there are 5 basal dendrites at the soma with 30 branch points, while space filling dendritic arbors can contain hundreds of branch points, and selective arbors can contain as few as 0 or 1. Figure 2 is a representation of a CA1 pyramidal cells of a rat, showing many branch points and dendritic length.  Gene expression  In reference to a study on the genes related to basal dendrites, there is proven association with the TAOK2 gene and its interaction with the NPR1-SEMA3A signaling pathway. Research shows growth of basal dendrites when more of the TAOK2 gene is expressed while lower expression decreases the number of dendrites within mice. Additionally, decreasing expression of basal dendrites occurs when the Nrp1 gene is downregulated. Though, the effect can be cancelled through overexpression of TAOK2.

Oblique dendrites typically branch one to two times before terminating. Dendrites are extensions of the cell body of a neuron. Growth and Development The growth and development of oblique dendrites in rats has been linked to the type of environment, or condition, they are placed in. This is also known as environmental enrichment. The three types of conditions used in studies are an enriched conditioned, standard condition, and impoverished condition. The enriched condition contains mazes, an exercise wheel, other rats, and toys. The standard condition generally has a wheel for voluntary exercise and other rats. The impoverished condition only contains fellow rats. Animals placed in an enriched environment had heavier, thicker cortexes and an increase in the number of dendritic branches (including oblique dendrites) in the hippocampus than the standard or impoverished condition.Watson, Neil, Breedlove, Marc \\"The Mind's Machine: Foundations of Brain and Behavior\\" Sinauer Associates, 2012, Chapter 13: Memory, Learning, and Developmentvan Praag, Henriette, Gerd Kempermann, and Fred H.

Gage. \\"Neural consequences of environmental enrichment.\\" Nature Reviews Neuroscience 1.3 (2000): 191-198. This is important because an increase in oblique dendrites and dendritic branching allows for increased neurotransmitter uptake. Environmental enrichment is crucial in early brain development due to increase formation of synapses, or synaptogenesis. This results in an increase in oblique dendrites and dendritic branching. Effects on Oblique Dendrites from Alzheimer’s Disease The beta amyloid peptide, which may lead to the formation of amyloid plaques, has been linked to Alzheimer's Disease. The peptide has been shown to block A-type voltage-gated potassium channel in pyramidal cell dendrites; the thin branches of the oblique dendrites are especially susceptible to disruption from the beta amyloid blockage of the A-type potassium channels which may lead to decline in cognitive function in the early stages of Alzheimer's Disease.Morse, Thomas M., Nicholas T.

Category:Neurohistology ","title":"Oblique dendrite"},{"id":"2473022","text":"Dog Eat Dog is the 12th studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, released in 1985. It was her second album for Geffen Records. As with its predecessor Wild Things Run Fast, Dog Eat Dog moves away from Mitchell's previous folk and jazz influences in favour of 1980s studio pop. The album was a particular departure for Mitchell due to its highly synthetic sound – it was the first (and one of the few albums) on which she plays no guitar and on which she focuses entirely on keyboards (mostly synthesizers and the Fairlight CMI sampler). Dog Eat Dog also featured an expanded role for Mitchell's bass-playing husband Larry Klein, who not only co-produced and played keyboards, but played a significant part in shaping the album's technological pop sound and also wrote the music for two of the songs. All guitars were played by session musician Michael Landau, using an electric/textural approach very different from Mitchell's own. Over the course of the next few albums, Mitchell would gradually return to a more organic approach similar to her mid-'70s sound.  Recording  British electro-pop musician Thomas Dolby plays a prominent role on Dog Eat Dog, although his involvement led to friction. Dolby thought he'd been hired to produce the album, whereas it was Mitchell's understanding that he'd been hired as a sampling and production consultant. On the original issue of the album, Dolby was credited as a co-producer, but on the version released as part of the 2003 Mitchell box set The Complete Geffen Recordings albums he's only credited with \\"sound file assistance\\". Mitchell was enthusiastic about the potential of sampling and played a proactive role in incorporating it. She recorded the bashed metal sound on \\"The Three Great Stimulants\\" herself, sourcing it from an abandoned metal sheeting panel in an alleyway near her New York home, and forced its inclusion despite arguing with Klein and Dolby, who both believed that the sample was too low-fidelity. Mitchell also based \\"Smokin' (Empty, Try Another)\\" around a loop of the sampled sound of the cigarette machine in the hall of the studio where Wild Things Run Fast was recorded. Lyrically, the album dealt with prominent issues in mid-1980s society, such as Reaganism, televangelists, consumerism and famine in Ethiopia. \\"Good Friends\\" was recorded as a duet with Michael McDonald, Rod Steiger made a voiceover appearance on \\"Tax Free\\" as a televangelist, while Dolby and Bob \\"Zyg\\" Winard added humorous character vocal interjections in the background to \\"Shiny Toys\\". Some connections to Mitchell's past work are evident in the use of horn sections, and also by appearances from James Taylor and saxophonist Wayne Shorter.  Release  \\"Shiny Toys\\" and \\"Good Friends\\" were both released as singles. A video was produced for \\"Good Friends\\" using film animation by Jim Blashfield. \\"Shiny Toys\\" was also released in a 12\\" extended dance single format, remix by François Kevorkian, and had a more complete lyric than the album version, featuring additional spoken character voices by Thomas Dolby (\\"I LOVE being out on the golf course!\\").
