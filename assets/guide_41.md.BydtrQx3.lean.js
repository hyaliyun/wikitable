It was originally built to house fire crews assigned to patrol the surrounding National Forest. In the 1990s, the United States Forest Service began renting Musick Guard Station to recreational visitors. The Musick Guard Station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  In the 1920s and 1930s, Forest Service employees often traveled many miles from local ranger stations to forest work sites. Since the forest road networks were not well developed, getting to a job site meant a long trek, carrying all the equipment need to perform the field work. This made it impractical for employees to make daily round-trips. To facilitate work at remote sites, the Forest Service built guard stations at strategic locations throughout the forest to house fire patrols and project crews.Jacoby, Jayson, \\"Rustic Forest Service cabins available for rent\\", Baker City Herald, Baker City, Oregon, 27 April 2006. After World War II, the Forest Service greatly expanded its road network, allowing employees to get to most National Forest areas within a few hours. As a result, guard stations lost their utility. The Forest Service found new uses for some stations, but most were demolished or abandoned. In the 1990s, historic preservation groups with the support of Forest Service employees began pressing National Forest managers to preserve the remaining structures. To finance the preservation effort the Forest Service started renting its guard stations to the public. The Musick Guard Station was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1934. It is located in the Umpqua National Forest approximately east of Cottage Grove, Oregon, in the heart of the old Bohemia mining district. The area is named after James \\"Bohemia\\" Johnson, the prospector who discovered gold there in 1863. The guard station was named after the nearby Musick Mine, a large gold mining operation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\\"Musick Guard Station - Oregon\\", United States Forest Service, Department of Agriculture, Portland, Oregon, 14 December 2007.\\"Recreational Activities - Recreation Rentals\\", Umpqua National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Roseburg, Oregon, 8 September 2006. It was originally used as a home station for fire crews that patrolled the forests around the Bohemia mining area. The cabin was used as a summer barracks for Forest Service fire patrols and trail crews until the 1960s when it was abandoned. In the early 1990s, the Forest Service started renting cabins including Musick Guard Station to the public for recreational purposes.\\"Musick Guard Station, Oregon\\", Public Land Information Center, Public Lands Interpretive Association, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 14 June 2008. Because of its rustic architecture and the cabin's unique historic value as an early Forest Service guard station, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.\\"Musick Guard Station\\" , Archiplanet, http://www.archiplanet.org, 5 December 2006.  Structure  The Musick Guard Station is located on a narrow forested ridge between Fairview Peak and Grouse Mountain, at about elevation. It is surrounded by rugged mountains with steep slopes covered with Douglas fir, spruce, and western hemlock. The Musick Guard Station is a rustic two-story cabin. It has a wood- frame structure and a concrete foundation. The exterior is covered with weatherboard and shingles. It is stained dark brown so it blends into the surrounding forest landscape. On the first floor, the cabin has three rooms. There is a central living room, a kitchen, and a small bedroom. The upstairs is a bunkroom that provides additional sleeping quarters. The cabin has two wooden platform beds and four bunk bed sets; however, there are no mattresses. The cabin is also furnished with table and chairs. In the living room, there is a wood-burning stove for heat. In the kitchen, there is a wood-burning cook stove. The cabin does not have electricity or water. Image:Musick Guard Station 02.jpg*Living room stove Image:Musick Guard Station 03.jpg*Kitchen work area Image:Musick Guard Station 04.jpg*Downstairs Bedroom Image:Musick Guard Station 05.jpg*Outdoor cook grill There is a vault-type outhouse located near the cabin. A horse barn, a small shed, an outdoor fireplace with a cooking grill, and a picnic table are also located on the guard station grounds. There is room for tent camping at the site as well.  Recreation  In the summer, visitors can hike nearby trails. The Bohemia Mountain Trail is a particularly popular. The trailhead is a little over a mile from the guard station. From there, it is a 3/4 mile hike to the summit of Bohemia Mountain which is highest point on the Cottage Grove Ranger District. However, it is not an easy hike with grades averaging 15-20 percent most of the way. A one- way trip takes about an hour from the trailhead. Hikers must pack their own water since none is available on the trail. From the summit of Bohemia Mountain there is an excellent view of the Cascade Range from Mount Hood to Mount Shasta.\\"Recreational Activities - Hiking #1440 Bohemia Mountain\\", Umpqua National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Roseburg, Oregon, 3 June 2008. Fairview Peak lookout tower near Musick Guard StationAnother popular hike is to the summit of near-by Fairview Peak. Fairview Peak summit is about two miles (3 km) from the guard station. At the top there is a fire lookout tower that is manned during the summer. When a Forest Service lookout is in residence, the tower is open to the public. Visitors can climb the tower and see how fires are spotted and their location plotted using an azimuth. From the lookout tower's deck there is a panoramic view of the surrounding forest and the Cascade Mountains. On a clear day, visitor can see a far north as Mt. Hood and as far south as Mt. Shasta. In the Bohemia area, it is important to stay on designated hiking trails. Most of the old mines in the area are located on private property and can be very dangerous. It is particularly dangerous to enter abandoned tunnels or shafts.  Access  Musick Guard Station is available for public reservations from mid-June to mid-October at a rate of $50 per night. The Umpqua National Forest keeps 95 percent of the rental fee to maintain the cabin and improve the site. The maximum capacity of the cabin is 10 people. There is no electricity or water at the site. Therefore, visitors must bring plenty of water for drinking, cooking, and washing, as well as a cold chest and non-flammable lanterns or lights. In addition, visitors must bring their own sleeping bags or bedding, cooking utensils, toiletries, towel, and first aid kit. Musick Guard Station is located from Cottage Grove. There are a number of alternative routes to the guard station. Contact the Umpqua National Forest headquarters in Roseburg, Oregon or the Cottage Grove Ranger District in Cottage Grove during normal business hours for route information and road conditions.

He is also Clarence L. Ver Steeg Professor in the Arts and Sciences and Charles Deering McCormick Professor of Teaching Excellence. Known for his use of anthropological methods in historical research, he was a pioneer in the historical study of ritual and feuding. He has been especially influential in using and interpreting microhistorical methods, which were first devised by historians in Italy. His work has focused on Renaissance Italy, especially the Republic of Venice and its territories.  Family  Muir was raised in Salt Lake City, Utah and is the descendant of early Mormon pioneers. His great grandfather, William Smith Muir, served in the Mormon Battalion during the War with Mexico and as a sergeant in the U.S. Army raised the first American flag over San Diego, California. William Smith later settled in Bountiful, Utah where he began to farm in 1852. His descendants used the farm in Bountiful as the nucleus for a shipping and packing business for fresh produce from Utah, Oregon, Idaho, and Nevada. Muir's father, Edward Wallace Muir Sr., was the long-serving president of the company, then known as Muir-Roberts, Co., Inc. Muir's brother, Phillip R. Muir, serves as the fifth-generation president of the company, now known as Muir Copper Canyon Farms, which is a food service provider for restaurants and institutions in Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. Muir's maternal grandfather, Samuel Morgan, was the Superintendent of Schools in Davis County, Utah. Muir's mother, Mary Margaret Muir, is an art historian who taught at the University of Utah and is an expert on the noted western landscape painter, LeConte Stewart.  Life and career  Muir studied History at the University of Utah (BA 1969) and Modern European History at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey (MA 1970, PhD 1975). He has taught at Stockton State College in New Jersey, Syracuse University, Louisiana State University, and Northwestern University, where he served as department chair. He has lived and conducted research for extended periods in Florence, Venice, and Rome, Italy. He is the past president of the Sixteenth Century Society and Conference (2004) and from 2012 to 2014 was president of the Renaissance Society of America.RSA Presidents He has held fellowships from among others the Guggenheim Foundation,Guggenheim Fellow: Edward Muir, 1984 the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, the National Humanities Center, and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Stanford.John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation - 1984 Fellows Page In 2010, he received the Distinguished Achievement Award from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, currently the largest award in the humanities.Distinguished Achievement Award (Muir) In 2014 he became a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Throughout his career his work has rotated around two problems, the means for establishing a civil society in late medieval and Renaissance Italy, especially through ritual, and the forces of disorder working against civil society, especially vendettas. Although rooted in an analysis of the social structures of cities and networks of patrons and families, most of his work has engaged the interpretation of meaning through public representations, whether in civic rituals, carnival festivity, or operas. He is an avid skier.  Works  * Civic Ritual in Renaissance Venice (Princeton University Press, 1981) (Winner of the Herbert Baxter Adams Prize and Howard R.

It was formed on 24 August 1937 in Kanazawa as a square division, simultaneously with the 108th division. The nucleus for the formation was the 9th division headquarters. It was subordinated from the beginning to the Japanese Northern China Area Army. First formation The 109th division was sent to North China in October 1937. It closely cooperated with the 108th division, contributing to the Beiping‚ÄìHankou Railway Operation and the capture of the Linfen city. Later it also provided a garrison for the Shanxi province. The division was eventually dissolved 24 December 1939. Second formation The 109th division was reformed in May 1944 from 1st Independent Mixed Brigade (Imperial Japanese Army) and other Bonin Islands garrisons reinforced by recruits from K≈çfu mobilization district. The 109th Division was assigned to the 31st army, under Commanding Lieutenant General Hideyoshi Obata. It comprised the bulk of the Japanese garrison on the volcanic islands of Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima which was wiped out by American forces from February to March 1945 in Battle of Iwo Jima. The structure of the 109th was different than most divisions in the IJA. After 1936, the normal make up of a division was the triangular organization, with three infantry regiments to a division. The 109th (along with the 91st Infantry Division) were considered square divisions because they had two infantry brigades (5000 men each) with two infantry regiments each.IJA organization - Retrieved 2014-04-17 During the buildup prior to the attack of Iwo-jima General Kuribayashi divided the 109th and each was built up to maximum strengths. The 109th, as the Ogasawara island Detachment was the Ogasawara (Bonin Islands) District Group, also called the Ogasawara Army Group, with an approximate strength of 47,000 troops. =1st Brigade= The 1st Independent Mixed Brigade, led by Major General Tachibana, and the 17th Independent Mixed Regiment, as well as other elements, were stationed on Chichi Jima (Father Island) with approximately 25,000 Note: Google review- Retrieved 2015-04-17 troops. Many were deployed to other island defenses such as the rest of the middle cluster known as Father Island (groups); Ani-jima, Ototo-jima, Mago-jima, along with islets Higashi-jima, Nishi-jima, and Minami-jima. The northernmost cluster or Groom Islands (group) included; Yome-jima, Muko-jima, and Nak≈çdo-jima or Nakadachi-jima. The southernmost cluster known as the Mother Island (group) of Haha-jima, Ane- jima, Im≈çto-jima, Mei-jima, along with the smaller Hira-shima and Muko-jima. These groups of islands were by-passed when Iwo-jima was chosen to attack but were subjected to bombing and naval shelling by the U.S. military. =2nd Brigade= The 2nd Independent Mixed Brigade, led by Major General Kotau Osuga, and the Third Battalion of the 17th Regiment, led by Major Tomachi Fujiwara, was on Iwo Jima with Kuribayashi. The 2700 man 145th infantry regiment under Colonel Masuo Ikeda, a part of 46th division, was diverted from Saipan to Iwo Jima and Rear Admiral Toshinosuke Ichimaru that arrived with 2300 navy personnel.Iwo Jima: 109th Division-Retrieved 2014-04-15 Many of the 109th's personnel had previously served in China, Burma and the Dutch East Indies and had become reservists who were now reluctant to go back to battle. To bolster morale the Japanese Emperor Hirohito sent his own palace guard of anti-aircraft gunners to Chichi Jima to support the troops‚Äîas it was expected the main force of Americans would strike there, however the Allied Joint Chiefs of Staff decided to bypass Chichi Jima altogether. =Preparations= A U.S. map of tunnel defences around Iwo Jima built by the 109th With preparations underway Kuribayashi worked with the tactic of defense-in-depth building numerous pillboxes for machine-gunners and 13,000 yards of tunnels with even a field-hospital worked in. However he had issues with many officers‚Äîdismissing 18 of them along with his Chief-of-staff, Kuribayashi also lost control of the Naval troops who dug in on the beaches. =The Battle Begins= American troops capture a Japanese flag On 19 February 1945 the battle began, but quickly came the feeling that the 109th were doomed as air or naval relief would not be able to help. Kuribayashi ordered his troops to inflict maximum damage and casualties on the enemy and to \\"kill 10 men before dying\\". For 33 days the 109th fought on Iwo Jima, facing against tanks and heavy bombardments from the sea and air. In the end only 1083 Japanese survived, with a mere 216 captured from the 109th's 21,000 men during the battle, the other 867 Japanese soldiers came from other units. As for Kuribayashi, it is generally thought that he committed suicide by leading the last major counterattack. The rest held out hungry and alone in Iwo Jima's tunnels until the U.S. soldiers used explosives to clear the tunnels weeks later.

It was discovered in the Karoo Basin of South Africa, and first named by Richard Owen in 1881. It was named so because it appeared to be an ancestor for cat-like marsupials, but not yet a mammal itself. It contains five species, A. felinus, A. whaitsi, A. polyodon, A. wilmanae, and A.? watermeyeri.Owen, R. 1881. On the order Theriodontia with a description of a new genus and species (Aelurognathus fel. Ow.). Quat. Jour. Geol. Soc. London. (Vol. 37): 261-265. A. felinus, the type species, is generally well described with established features, while the other four species are not due to their poorly preserved holotypes. __TOC__  Discovery  Aelurosaurus was discovered in 1881 in the Karoo Basin of South Africa. The skull holotype was missing the postorbital region, so Owen was left to describe the anterior portion. After examining the sutures and teeth, he assumed the first specimen to be from an older, adult Aelurosaurus, seeing that they were no longer in perfect condition.  Species  Restoration of A. felinus = A. felinus = Originally described by Owen, the orbit is a 2.5 centimeters by 2 centimeters ellipse, and the nostril 1.3 centimeters wide and 0.9 centimeters long. The upper jaw has a maximum width of roughly 3.5 centimeters just below the orbits. At a little more than 7.5 centimeters long and 2 centimeters wide, the mandible spans almost the entirety of the skull. This particular specimen was preserved with the mouth closed, with the upper teeth fully covering the mandibular teeth. On the upper jaw, there are five incisors, a gap of 0.8 centimeters, a canine (1.2 centimeters exposed, roughly 3.6 centimeters in total length), another 0.8 centimeter gap, and then five molars. After Owen removed the alveolar wall of the upper maxillary canine, he exposed the mandibular canine, which he found to be the same size as the maxillary. The semicircular canal found on A. felinus and all other gorgonopsians suggests that their heads were ventrally tilted, a characteristic of predators.Ara√∫jo, R., V. Fernandez, M. J. Polcyn, J. Fr√∂bisch, R. M. S. Martins. 2017. Aspects of gorgonopsian paleobiology and evolution: insights from the basicranium, occiput, osseous labyrinth, vasculature, and neuroanatomy. PeerJ. (Vol. 5): 1-45. While Owen had originally assumed the holotype to be the skull of an adult, it has been argued that it was actually the skull of a juvenile. Owen only attributed its old age to the state of its sutures and teeth, while others noticed features indicating a young age, including its ‚Äú...short snout, large orbits, slender postcanine teeth, tooth replacement, numerous small postcanine teeth, well developed foramina, large supraorbital portion of the frontal, anteriorly situated preparietal, slender skull arches, narrow vomer, well developed palatal tuberosities, teeth on transverse apophyses, large ectopterygoids, slender mandible, [and] open symphysis‚Äù. = A. whaitsi = First described by Robert Broom in 1911. The holotype of A. whaitsi is another skull, but mostly snout, with the main indicator being a flatter symphysis. Its classification went back and forth throughout the entire century since it has very few defining features, all of which could be juvenile features of other genera. = A. polyodon = First described by Broom in 1935. The holotype of A. polyodon is a crushed snout. Originally named Galerhinus polyodon, it was renamed Aelurosaurus polyodon in 1970. = A. wilmanae = First described by Broom in 1940. The holotype is a skull that is the best preserved of all the Aelurosaurus species. The defining feature is a larger snout compared to A. felinus, but overall the skull is still small at just 11 centimeters long. = A.? watermeyeri = First described by Broom in 1940. The holotype is a skull, and was originally named Scylacocephalus watermeyeri. The genus is still under debate, since it shares features with both Aelurosaurus (such as a large orbit and short snout) and Aloposaurus (such as larger preparietal and postfrontal).

It was first named by Broom in 1948. The type and only species is C. rubidgei. It is relatively rare, with only four known specimens. Description Clelandina rubidgei has an extraordinarily small sclerotic ring relative to the size of its orbit, which implies that it was diurnal. It is the only rubidgeine with a preserved sclerotic ring, so it is unknown whether this trait was shared by other members of the subfamily. Like all rubidgeines, it was relatively large, with a skull up to 36 cm long. It had reduced dentition, with the teeth posterior to the canines being absent and replaced with a bony ridge. The skull has heavily pachyostosed, with massive rugose bosses. Classification Clelandina shares many characteristics with Rubidgea and Dinogorgon, which has led some authors to synonymize them.

Kimball, was built in 1904 at 23rd and M Streets in South Omaha, Nebraska. A Carnegie library, it was razed in December 1953; a new library constructed in the same spot opened in October 1954. The second library building was officially closed on May 17, 2008, when a new branch was opened at 2808 Q Street. South Omaha Public Library History The library was funded by a grant of $50,000 from the Andrew Carnegie Library Fund. The city's plan to erect a new library for the growing area of South Omaha began with the purchase of a lot at 23rd and M Streets in 1902 for $3,5000. Thomas Rogers Kimball was hired to design the structure. He chose a Renaissance Revival style, reminiscent of a small Italian palazzo. The two-story building was built of brick and rusticated limestone. The front entrance was decorated with an carved arch supported by columns. Flanking both sides of the entrance were two arched windows, the larger with iron grating. The first floor was devoted to circulation and basic library services, while the second floor contained a large assembly room. There was solid oak woodwork throughout and the building was topped with a red clay tile roof. When the City of Omaha annexed South Omaha in 1915, the South Omaha Public Library became the first branch of the Omaha Public Library system. The building remained active until December 1953 when it was razed; a new library was built on the same site. The second South Omaha Public Library building opened in October 1954. In contrast to the Carnegie library, the second library was a modern one-story building with floor-to-ceiling glass along one wall, designed by Leo A. Daly architects of Omaha. The second library building was officially closed on May 17, 2008, when a new branch was opened at 2808 Q Street.

He and Marshall Perlin defended Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Background He was born in 1901 to Alexander Bloch, an attorney, and Pauline Bloch. He graduated from City College of New York in 1920 before attending Columbia Law School. Career Bloch worked as an attorney in New York from 1924 to 1942, then served in the U.S. Army during World War II. =Hiss Case= On December 14, 1948, Bloch appeared before the House Un- American Activities Committee (HUAC) as counsel for Marion Bachrach. On August 3, 1948, Whittaker Chambers alleged that she had been a member of the Ware group. She was born Marion Abt and was the sister of John Abt, another alleged member of that group (to whose membership Lee Pressman attested, though Abt himself never did). At the time of Bachrach's testimony, she stated she was a writer in the national office of the Communist Party of the USA in New York City, where she also lived. Under advice of counsel, she pled the Fifth Amendment (refused to answer any questions that might incriminate herself). At the time, Bloch himself answered questions that confirmed he had already represented Steve Nelson before the committee. Nelson was (according to a HUAC committee member) a \\"head of the Communist Party in western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, and northern West Virginia. He now lives in Harmarville, PA. I believe he served the Communist Party for a number of years as a sort of secretary of labor. He is an expert on so-called foreign groups and is currently working to keep the Tito Comimmists from jumping the line here as they did abroad\\" =Rosenberg case= He defended Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Julius wrote to Bloch that Julius himself was \\"the first victim of American Fascism\\". Two weeks before the date scheduled for their deaths, the Rosenbergs were visited by James V. Bennett, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. After the meeting they issued a statement: > Yesterday, we were offered a deal by the Attorney General of the United > States. We were told that if we cooperated with the Government, our lives > would be spared. By asking us to repudiate the truth of our innocence, the > Government admits its own doubts concerning our guilt. We will not help to > purify the foul record of a fraudulent conviction and a barbaric sentence. > We solemnly declare, now and forever more, that we will not be coerced, even > under pain of death, to bear false witness and to yield up to tyranny our > rights as free Americans.

If we are executed it will be the murder of innocent people > and the shame will be upon the Government of the United States.Statement > issued by the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg after the visit of James V. > Bennett, Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (May, 1953) Personal and death Following execution of the Rosenbergs, Bloch delivered the eulogy at their funeral. He served as guardian for the Rosenberg's children, Michael and Robert, until they were adopted. He also defended the Trenton Six. Bloch died of a heart attack at age 52 on January 30, 1954 in his Manhattan apartment.

The term \\"cushion\\" is usually applied to woody plants that grow as spreading mats, are limited in height above the ground (a few inches at most), have relatively large and deep tap roots, and have life histories adapted to slow growth in a nutrient-poor environment with delayed reproductivity and reproductive cycle adaptations. The plant form is an example of parallel or convergent evolution with species from many different plant families on different continents converging on the same evolutionary adaptations to endure the harsh environmental conditions.Went, F. W. (1971). Parallel evolution. Taxon, 20(2/3): 197-226. Description Cushion plants form large, low-growing mats that can grow up to in diameter. The typical form is a compact mass of closely spaced stems with minimal apical dominance that terminate in individual rosettes. Each stem grows at a consistent rate so that no one rosette is more exposed than the rest of the cushion. Observations on senescence have concluded that cushion plants typically die en masse rather than individual rosettes dying at separate times. Underneath the living rosettes, the plants typically produce nonphotosynthetic material or allow previous leaves to die, creating an insulating effect.Badano, E. I., Jones, C. G., Cavieres, L. A., and Wright, J. P. (2006). Assessing impacts of ecosystem engineers on community organization: a general approach illustrated by effects of a high-Andean cushion plant. OIKOS, 115: 369-385. Cushion plants grow very slowly. In the case of Silene acaulis, growth rates have been measured at to per year. Coinciding with this impeded growth is increased longevity, with the largest cushions of some species attaining ages of up to 350 years.McCarthy, D. P. (1992). Dating with cushion plants: establishment of a Silene acaulis growth curve in the Canadian Rockies. Arctic and Alpine Research, 24(1): 50-55. A study on Azorella compacta in southern Peru determined that, based on a growth rate of 1.4 mm per year, individual plants in the study area were upwards of 850 years old with occasional specimens approaching 3,000 years old.Ralph, C. P. (1978). Observations on Azorella compacta (Umbelliferae), a tropical Andean cushion plant. Biotropica, 10(1): 62-67. Ecology Cushion plants commonly grow in rapidly draining rocky or sandy soils in exposed and arid subalpine, alpine, arctic, subarctic or subantarctic feldmark habitats. In certain habitats, such as peaty fens or bogs, cushion plants can also be a keystone species in a climax community. As such, the plants are often colonizers of bare habitat with little or no soil. Due to their role as initiators of primary succession in alpine habitats, the plants have specific adaptations to the desiccation and mechanically harsh environment of windy alpine slopes. A cushion plant growing on Mount Ossa, Tasmania. The establishment of a new cushion plant on a windy slope, or freshly exposed Arctic tundra is not a common event. The established plants may be hundreds of years old, although they extend only a few inches above the surface. The plants are spreading and are wider than they are tall, but they are not extensive above the ground. The plant will grow for many years before it is ready to begin its first reproductive cycle. The plant actively grows only during the limited period when enough warmth and sunlight are available for photosynthesis, but may begin this cycle prior to the snow melting. The plant's form is well adapted to trapping warm summer air within its body to extend the time during which it can photosynthesize. Cushions at higher elevation are typically smaller and denser.Alatalo, J.M. and Molau, U. 1995. Effect of altitude on the sex ratio in populations of Silene acaulis. ‚Äì Nordic Journal of Botany. 15: 251-256. doi: 10.1111/j.1756-1051.1995.tb00150.x Plants growing in the alpine or subalpine regions face the challenge of obtaining and retaining water. One solution for obtaining water is the growth of an extensive root system. A small alpine forget-me-not may stand only inches above the ground, but its taproot can extend for a couple of feet below the soil surface. The long taproot is necessary because of both the limited precipitation in many alpine and arctic environments, mostly as snowfall, and because of the rapid drainage of a newly formed and shallow soil. Besides obtaining water, the plant must also retain moisture to survive in a dry and desiccating environment. The compact growth form of cushion plants reduces air flow over the surface of the epidermis, reducing the rate of water loss. Additionally, many cushion plants have small and fleshy leaves which reduce the surface area of the plant, which reduces transpiration and conserves water. In alpine environments well above the tree line, cold is a limiting factor for growth. So, by having tightly packed stems and foliage, cushion plants are able to convert and trap heat from sunlight, causing them to warm several degrees above the ambient air temperature and extend their short growing season. Many alpine cushion plants also have thick matted hairs that warm up and heat the air trapped in between the hairs when the sun shines. These hairs also act as a greenhouse by preventing the warmer air from rising away from the plant, and they also act as wind breaks, preventing the wind from blowing away the trapped heat.Adams, J. M. 2007. Vegetation-climate interaction how vegetation makes the global environment. Berlin: Springer. p. 82. The cushion plant may have flowers that are large and showy for such a small perennial, or sometimes hundreds of small flowers.Alatalo, J.M. and Molau, U. 1995. Effect of altitude on the sex ratio in populations of Silene acaulis. ‚Äì Nordic Journal of Botany. 15: 251-256. doi: 10.1111/j.1756-1051.1995.tb00150.x This is necessary to attract pollinators over long distances, and in the short season of growth. Cushion plants have been described as ecosystem engineers because of their ability to locally maintain increased moisture and soil temperatures below the cushion ¬±15 ¬∞C (¬±27 ¬∞F) relative to adjacent soil temperatures. Some, specifically Mulinum leptacanthum and Oreopolus glacialis, have been positively identified as species that alter the macronutrient concentrations in the soil. These attributes allow other species to more easily colonize the harsh environments that cushion plants inhabit. Species richness is therefore demonstrably increased where cushion plants have colonized. Diversity Donatia novae- zelandiae The cushion plant form is not endemic to any single area or plant family. About 338 species worldwide in 78 genera in areas ranging from Tasmania, New Zealand, and Tierra del Fuego to the arctic tundra of Svalbard have convergently evolved the same plant form in response to similar environmental conditions. Thirty-four diverse plant families, such as Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Caryophyllaceae, Donatiaceae, and the Stylidiaceae, include cushion plant species.Heusser, C. J. (1995).

Oil-rich Nigeria stated recently that India has replaced the United States as its largest crude importer, as it covered 20‚Äì25 percent of India's domestic oil demand. India, however, now purchases some 30% of Nigeria's daily crude production which currently hovers around 2.5 million barrels. With bilateral oil trade valued at US$10 billion, Indian oil companies are also involved in oil drilling operations in Nigeria and have plans to set up refineries there.ONGC Mittal Drills Nigerian Offshore Oil Block 279  Background  Both nations were colonised by the British Empire; India supported independence of African countries from colonial rule and established its diplomatic mission in 1958 ‚Äì two years before Nigeria officially gained independence from British rule. Since the restoration of democracy in 1998, Nigeria has joined India in becoming the largest democracies in their respective regions with diverse religious and ethnic populations. They possess diverse natural and economic resources and are the largest economies in their respective regions. Both are members of the Commonwealth of Nations, G-77 and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Development of bilateral relations After Nigeria's independence, both nations sought to develop strong relations. In 1962, the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru made a state visit to Nigeria. In 1999, the democratically elected President of Nigeria Olusegun Obasanjo made a state visit to India and was the chief guest at India's Republic Day celebrations. In 2007, Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh became the first Indian leader to visit Nigeria in 45 years and addressed a joint session of the Parliament of Nigeria.  Commerce  Since the restoration of democracy in Nigeria in 1998‚Äì99, its trade with India has increased substantially ‚Äì climbing from US$293.71 million in 1999‚Äì00 to $875 million in 2005‚Äì06. As of 2007, the value of non-oil bilateral trade was estimated between US$6‚Äì7.9 billion. Exports to India accounted for US$3.9 billion between April and September, 2006. India's exports to Nigeria were valued at US$875 million in 2005/06. Indian companies have invested heavily in Nigeria in manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering, information technology and communications. Indian companies have invested in the Ajaokuta Iron and Steel Industry as well as Aladja Steel Complex in Delta. Nigeria has actively encouraged Indian companies to invest and expand Nigeria's mining and development of coal, gold, iron ore, chrome ore, lead and other mineral resources. =Oil trade= Nigeria is the largest African crude oil supplier to India -- India imports 400,000 barrels per day from Nigeria valued at US$10 billion annually.India seeks expansion of oil trade with Nigeria Additionally, major Indian oil companies regularly issue tender of Nigerian crude oil. Cultural relations About 50,000 Nigerians live in India, while about 35,000 Indians reside in Nigeria. Despite economic ties via the Commonwealth connection there are also ethnic tensions between two. As such in 2013, a killing in Goa, accused on an Indian, led to protests and a \\"law and order\\" problem there. Such xenophobic incitation were encouraged by politicians.After the riots, Goa's Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar ordered police to find and expel Nigerians living illegally in Goa and Goan MLA Shantaram Naik said: \\"Nigerians misuse education schemes, violate the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), indulge in the drug trade and yet try to boss over Goans, which no civilised society would tolerate.\\" Some signs read \\"Say No to Nigerians\\" and others were said to have resolved not to rent out apartments to Nigerians. Nigerian reactions included High Commissioner Ndubuisi Vitus Amaku saying: \\"Indians need to understand that a large number of Nigerians are living legally in India and even if some are living illegally, there are laws in place to deal with that and those should be implemented. If Nigerians are living illegally [in Goa], you don't wait till their compatriot is murdered before you go around picking them up and threatening them with deportation. That's like rubbing salt in their wounds.\\" Administrative Attache Jacob Nwadibia warned: \\"If discrimination against Nigerians was not stopped immediately, Indians in Nigeria may face repercussions. There are only 50,000 Nigerians living in India, but there are over a million Indians living in Nigeria. Thousands of Indians living there will be thrown out on the streets if the forcible eviction of Nigerians in Goa does not stop.\\" Spokesman for the embassy Tokunbo Falohun pragmatically responded: \\"The discrimination is apparent and we just want that it should end and the law should take its own course.\\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/2013/11/murder-sparks-india-nigeria- diplomatic-storm-201311109531844644.html Indian Language School is in Lagos, educating Indian families.

For most of their history, condoms have been used both as a method of birth control, and as a protective measure against sexually transmitted diseases. Condoms have been made from a variety of materials; prior to the 19th century, chemically treated linen and animal tissue (intestine or bladder) are the best documented varieties. Rubber condoms gained popularity in the mid-19th century, and in the early 20th century major advances were made in manufacturing techniques. Prior to the introduction of the combined oral contraceptive pill, condoms were the most popular birth control method in the Western world. In the second half of the 20th century, the low cost of condoms contributed to their importance in family planning programs throughout the developing world. Condoms have also become increasingly important in efforts to fight the AIDS pandemic. The oldest condoms ever excavated were found in a cesspit located in the grounds of Dudley Castle and were made from animal membrane. The condoms dated back to as early as 1642. Antiquity to the Middle Ages for sex Whether condoms were used in ancient civilizations is debated by archaeologists and historians. Societies in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome preferred small families and are known to have practiced a variety of birth control methods. However, these societies viewed birth control as a woman's responsibility, and the only well- documented contraception methods were female-controlled devices (both possibly effective, such as pessaries, and ineffective, such as amulets). The writings of these societies contain \\"veiled references\\" to male-controlled contraceptive methods that might have been condoms, but most historians interpret them as referring to coitus interruptus or anal intercourse. The loincloths worn by Egyptian and Greek laborers were very sparse, sometimes consisting of little more than a covering for the glans of the penis. Records of these types of loincloths being worn by men in higher classes have made some historians speculate they were worn during intercourse; others, however, are doubtful of such interpretations. Historians may also cite one legend of Minos, related by Antoninus Liberalis in 150 AD, as suggestive of condom use in ancient societies. This legend describes a curse that caused Minos' semen to contain serpents and scorpions. To protect his sexual partner from these animals, Minos used a goat's bladder as a female condom. Contraceptives fell out of use in Europe after the decline of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century; the use of contraceptive pessaries, for example, is not documented again until the 15th century. If condoms were used during the Roman Empire, knowledge of them may have been lost during its decline. In the writings of Muslims and Jews during the Middle Ages, there are some references to attempts at male-controlled contraception, including suggestions to cover the penis in tar or soak it in onion juice. Some of these writings might describe condom use, but they are \\"oblique\\", \\"veiled\\", and \\"vague\\". 1500s to the 1800sRenaissance= A page from De Morbo Gallico (The French Disease), Gabriele Falloppio's treatise on syphilis. Published in 1564, it describes what is possibly the first use of condoms. Prior to the 15th century, some use of glans condoms (devices covering only the head of the penis) is recorded in Asia. Glans condoms seem to have been used for birth control, and to have been known only by members of the upper classes. In China, glans condoms may have been made of oiled silk paper, or of lamb intestines. In Japan, they were made of tortoise shell or animal horn. The first well-documented outbreak of what is now known as syphilis occurred in 1494 among French troops. The disease then swept across Europe. As Jared Diamond describes it, \\"when syphilis was first definitely recorded in Europe in 1495, its pustules often covered the body from the head to the knees, caused flesh to fall from people's faces, and led to death within a few months.\\" (The disease is less frequently fatal today.) By 1505, the disease had spread to Asia, and within a few decades had \\"decimated large areas of China\\". In 16th-century Italy, Gabriele Falloppio authored the earliest uncontested description of condom use. De Morbo Gallico (\\"The French Disease\\", referring to syphilis) was published in 1564, two years after Falloppio's death. In this tract, he recommended use of a device he claimed to have invented: linen sheaths soaked in a chemical solution and allowed to dry before use. The cloths he described were sized to cover the glans of the penis, and were held on with a ribbon. Fallopio claimed to have performed an experimental trial of the linen sheath on 1100 men, and reported that none of them had contracted the dreaded disease. After the publication of De Morbo Gallico, use of penis coverings to protect from disease is described in a wide variety of literature throughout Europe. The first indication these devices were used for birth control, rather than disease prevention, is the 1605 theological publication De iustitia et iure (On justice and law) by Catholic theologian Leonardus Lessius: he condemned them as immoral. The first explicit description that un petit linge (a small cloth) was used to prevent pregnancy is from 1655: a French novel and play titled L'Escole des Filles (The Philosophy of Girls). In 1666, the English Birth Rate Commission attributed a recent downward fertility rate to use of \\"condons\\", the first documented use of that word (or any similar spelling). In addition to linen, condoms during the Renaissance were made out of intestines and bladder. Cleaned and prepared intestine for use in glove making had been sold commercially since at least the 13th century. Condoms made from bladder and dating to the 1640s were discovered in an English privy; it is believed they were used by soldiers of King Charles I. Dutch traders introduced condoms made from \\"fine leather\\" to Japan. Unlike the horn condoms used previously, these leather condoms covered the entire penis. =18th century= Written references to condom use became much more common during the 18th century. Not all of the attention was positive: in 1708, John Campbell unsuccessfully asked Parliament to make the devices illegal. Noted English physician Daniel Turner condemned the condom, publishing his arguments against their use in 1717. He disliked condoms because they did not offer full protection against syphilis. He also seems to have argued that belief in the protection condoms offered encouraged men to engage in sex with unsafe partners - but then, because of the loss of sensation caused by condoms, these same men often neglected to actually use the devices. The French medical professor Jean Astruc wrote his own anti-condom treatise in 1736, citing Turner as the authority in this area. Physicians later in the 18th century also spoke against the condom, but not on medical grounds: rather, they expressed the belief that contraception was immoral. The condom market grew rapidly, however. 18th-century condoms were available in a variety of qualities and sizes, made from either linen treated with chemicals, or \\"skin\\" (bladder or intestine softened by treatment with sulphur and lye). They were sold at pubs, barbershops, chemist shops, open-air markets, and at the theater throughout Europe and Russia. The first recorded inspection of condom quality is found in the memoirs of Giacomo Casanova (which cover his life until 1774): to test for holes, he would often blow them up before use. A condom made from animal intestine circa 1900. Couples in colonial America relied on female-controlled methods of contraception, if they used contraceptives at all. The first known documents describing American condom use were written around 1800, two to three decades after the American Revolutionary War. Also around 1800, linen condoms lost popularity in the market and their production ceased: they were more expensive and were viewed as less comfortable when compared to skin condoms. Up to the 19th century, condoms were generally used only by the middle and upper classes. Perhaps more importantly, condoms were unaffordable for many: for a typical prostitute, a single condom might cost several months' pay. =Expanded marketing and introduction of rubber= The early 19th century saw contraceptives promoted to the poorer classes for the first time: birth control advocates in England included Jeremy Bentham and Richard Carlile, and noted American advocates included Robert Dale Owen and Charles Knowlton. Writers on contraception tended to prefer other methods of birth control, citing both the expense of condoms and their unreliability (they were often riddled with holes, and often fell off or broke), but they discussed condoms as a good option for some, and as the only contraceptive that also protected from disease. One group of British contraceptive advocates distributed condom literature in poor neighborhoods, with instructions on how to make the devices at home; in the 1840s, similar tracts were distributed in both cities and rural areas through the United States. From the 1820s through the 1870s, popular women and men lecturers traveled around America teaching about physiology and sexual matters. Many of them sold birth control devices, including condoms, after their lectures. They were condemned by many moralists and medical professionals, including America's first female doctor Elizabeth Blackwell. Blackwell accused the lecturers of spreading doctrines of \\"abortion and prostitution\\". In the 1840s, advertisements for condoms began to appear in British newspapers, and in 1861 a condom advertisement appeared in the New York Times. The rubber vulcanization process was invented by Charles Goodyear in 1839, and patented in 1844. The first rubber condom was produced in 1855, and by the late 1850s several major rubber companies were mass-producing, among other items, rubber condoms. A main advantage of rubber condoms was their reusability, making them a more economical choice in the long term. Compared to the 19th-century rubber condoms, however, skin condoms were initially cheaper and offered better sensitivity. For these reasons, skin condoms remained more popular than the rubber variety. However, by the end of the 19th century \\"rubber\\" had become a euphemism for condoms in countries around the world. For many decades, rubber condoms were manufactured by wrapping strips of raw rubber around penis-shaped molds, then dipping the wrapped molds in a chemical solution to cure the rubber. The earliest rubber condoms covered only the glans of the penis; a doctor had to measure each man and order the correct size. Even with the medical fittings, however, glans condoms tended to fall off during use. Rubber manufacturers quickly discovered they could sell more devices by manufacturing full-length one-size-fits-all condoms to be sold in pharmacies. =Increased popularity despite legal impediments= Distribution of condoms in the United States was limited by passage of the Comstock laws, which included a federal act banning the mailing of contraceptive information (passed in 1873) as well as State laws that banned the manufacture and sale of condoms in thirty states. In Ireland the 1889 Indecent Advertisements Act made it illegal to advertise condoms, although their manufacture and sale remained legal. Contraceptives were illegal in 19th-century Italy and Germany, but condoms were allowed for disease prevention. Despite legal obstacles, condoms continued to be readily available in both Europe and America, widely advertised under euphemisms such as male shield and rubber good. In late-19th- century England, condoms were known as \\"a little something for the weekend\\". Only in the Republic of Ireland were condoms effectively outlawed. In Ireland their sale and manufacture remained illegal until the 1970s. Opposition to condoms did not only come from moralists: by the late 19th century many feminists expressed distrust of the condom as a contraceptive, as its use was controlled and decided upon by men alone. They advocated instead for methods which were controlled by women, such as diaphragms and spermicidal douches. Despite social and legal opposition, at the end of the 19th century the condom was the Western world's most popular birth control method. Two surveys conducted in New York in 1890 and 1900 found that 45% of the women surveyed were using condoms to prevent pregnancy. A survey in Boston just prior to World War I concluded that three million condoms were sold in that city every year. 1870s England saw the founding of the first major condom manufacturing company, E. Lambert and Son of Dalston. In 1882, German immigrant Julius Schmidt founded one of the largest and longest-lasting condom businesses, Julius Schmid, Inc. (he dropped the 't' from his name in an effort to appear less Jewish). This New York business initially manufactured only skin condoms (in 1890 he was arrested by Anthony Comstock for having almost seven hundred of the devices in his house). In 1912, a German named Julius Fromm developed a new, improved manufacturing technique for condoms: dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution. Called cement dipping, this method required adding gasoline or benzene to the rubber to make it liquid. In America, Schmid was the first company to use the new technique. Using the new dipping method, French condom manufacturers were the first to add textures to condoms. Fromm was the first company to sell a branded line of condoms, Fromm's Act, which remains popular in Germany today. The condom lines manufactured by Schmid, Sheiks and Ramses, were sold through the late 1990s. Youngs Rubber Company, founded by Merle Youngs in late-19th-century America, introduced Trojans. Beginning in the second half of the 19th century, American rates of sexually transmitted diseases skyrocketed. Causes cited by historians include effects of the American Civil War, and the ignorance of prevention methods promoted by the Comstock laws. To fight the growing epidemic, sexual education classes were introduced to public schools for the first time, teaching about venereal diseases and how they were transmitted. They generally taught that abstinence was the only way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. The medical community and moral watchdogs considered STDs to be punishment for sexual misbehavior. The stigma on victims of these diseases was so great that many hospitals refused to treat people who had syphilis. 1900 to presentWorld War I to the 1920s= A World War I-era U.S. military poster promoting abstinence. The German military was the first to promote sex use among its soldiers, beginning in the second half of the 19th century. Early-20th-century experiments by the American military concluded that providing condoms to soldiers significantly lowered rates of sexually transmitted diseases. During World War I, the United States and (at the beginning of the war only) Britain were the only countries with soldiers in Europe who did not provide condoms and promote their use. By the end of the war, the American military had diagnosed almost 400,000 cases of syphilis and gonorrhea, a historic high. From just before 1900 to the beginning of World War I, almost all condoms used in Europe were imported from Germany. Germany not only exported condoms to other European countries, but was a major supplier to Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. During the war, the American companies Schmid and Youngs became the main suppliers of condoms to the European Allies. By the early 1920s, however, most of Europe's condoms were once again made in Germany. In 1918, just before the end of the war, an American court overturned a conviction against Margaret Sanger. In this case, the judge ruled that condoms could be legally advertised and sold for the prevention of disease. There were still a few state laws against buying and selling contraceptives, and advertising condoms as birth control devices remained illegal in over thirty states. But condoms began to be publicly, legally sold to Americans for the first time in forty-five years. Through the 1920s, catchy names and slick packaging became an increasingly important marketing technique for many consumer items, including condoms and cigarettes. Quality testing became more common, involving filling each condom with air followed by one of several methods intended to detect loss of pressure. Several American companies sold their rejects under cheaper brand names rather than discarding them. Consumers were advised to perform similar tests themselves before use, although few actually did so. Worldwide, condom sales doubled in the 1920s. Still, there were many prominent opponents of condoms. Founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud opposed all methods of birth control on the grounds that their failure rates were too high. Freud was especially opposed to the condom because it cut down on sexual pleasure. . Some feminists continued to oppose male-controlled contraceptives such as condoms. Many moralists and medical professionals opposed all methods of contraception. In 1920 the Church of England's Lambeth Conference condemned all \\"unnatural means of conception avoidance.\\" London's Bishop Arthur Winnington-Ingram complained of the number of condoms discarded in alleyways and parks, especially after weekends and holidays. In the U.S., condom advertising was legally restricted to their use as disease preventatives. They could be openly marketed as birth control devices in Britain, but purchasing condoms in Britain was socially awkward compared to the U.S. They were generally requested with the euphemism \\"a little something for the weekend.\\" Boots, the largest pharmacy chain in Britain, stopped selling condoms altogether in the 1920s, a policy that was not reversed until the 1960s. In post-World War I France, the government was concerned about falling birth rates. In response, it outlawed all contraceptives, including condoms. Contraception was also illegal in Spain. European militaries continued to provide condoms to their members for disease protection, even in countries where they were illegal for the general population. =Invention of latex and manufacturing automation= Latex, rubber suspended in water, was invented in 1920. Youngs Rubber Company was the first to manufacture a latex condom, an improved version of their Trojan brand. Latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement-dipped rubber condoms, which had to be smoothed by rubbing and trimming. Because it used water to suspend the rubber instead of gasoline and benzene, it eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories. Latex condoms also performed better for the consumer: they were stronger and thinner than rubber condoms, and had a shelf life of five years (compared to three months for rubber). Europe's first latex condom was an export from Youngs Rubber Company in 1929. In 1932 the London Rubber Company, which had previously served as a wholesaler for German- manufactured condoms, became Europe's first manufacturer of latex condoms, the Durex. Until the twenties, all condoms were individually hand-dipped by semiskilled workers. Throughout the decade of the 1920s, advances in automation of condom assembly line were made. Fred Killian patented the first fully automated line in 1930 and installed it in his manufacturing plant in Akron, Ohio. Killian charged $20,000 for his conveyor system - as much as $2 million in today's dollars. Automated lines dramatically lowered the price of condoms. Major condom manufacturers bought or leased conveyor systems, and small manufacturers were driven out of business. The skin condom, now significantly more expensive than the latex variety, became restricted to a niche high-end market. =Great Depression= In 1927, senior medical officers in the American military began promoting condom distribution and educational programs to members of the army and navy. By 1931, condoms were standard issue to all members of the U.S. military. This coincided with a steep decline in U.S. military cases of sexually transmitted disease. The U.S. military was not the only large organization that changed its moral stance on condoms: in 1930 the Anglican Church's Lambeth Conference sanctioned the use of birth control by married couples. In 1931 the Federal Council of Churches in the U.S. issued a similar statement. The Roman Catholic Church responded by issuing the encyclical Casti connubii affirming its opposition to all contraceptives, a stance it has never reversed. Semen analysis was first performed in the 1930s. Samples were typically collected by masturbation, another action opposed by the Catholic Church. In 1930s Spain, the first use of collection condoms was documented; holes put in the condom allowed the user to collect a sample without violating the prohibitions on contraception and masturbation. In 1932, Margaret Sanger arranged for a shipment of diaphragms to be mailed from Japan to a sympathetic doctor in New York City. When U.S. customs confiscated the package as illegal contraceptive devices, Sanger helped file a lawsuit. In 1936, a federal appeals court ruled in United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries that the federal government could not interfere with doctors providing contraception to their patients. In 1938, over three hundred birth control clinics opened in America, supplying reproductive care (including condoms) to poor women all over the country. Programs led by U.S. Surgeon General Thoman Parran included heavy promotion of condoms. These programs are credited with a steep drop in the U.S. STD rate by 1940. Two of the few places where condoms became more restricted during this period were Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Because of government concern about low birth rates, contraceptives were made illegal in Italy in the late 1920s. Although limited and highly controlled sales as disease preventatives were still allowed, there was a brisk black market trade in condoms as birth control. In Germany, laws passed in 1933 mandated that condoms could only be sold in plain brown wrappers, and only at pharmacies. Despite these restrictions, when World War II began Germans were using 72 million condoms every year. The elimination of moral and legal barriers, and the introduction of condom programs by the U.S. government helped condom sales. However, these factors alone are not considered to explain the Great Depression's booming condom industry. In the U.S. alone, more than 1.5 million condoms were used every day during the Depression, at a cost of over $33 million per year (not adjusted for inflation). One historian explains these statistics this way: \\"Condoms were cheaper than children.\\" During the Depression condom lines by Schmid gained in popularity: that company still used the cement-dipping method of manufacture. Unlike the latex variety, these condoms could be safely used with oil-based lubricants. And while less comfortable, older-style rubber condoms could be reused and so were more economical, a valued feature in hard times. More attention was brought to quality issues in the 1930s. In 1935, a biochemist tested 2000 condoms by filling each one with air and then water: he found that 60% of them leaked. The condom industry estimated that only 25% of condoms were tested for quality before packaging. The media attention led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to classify condoms as a drug in 1937 and mandate that every condom be tested before packaging. Youngs Rubber Company was the first to institute quality testing of every condom they made, installing automatic testing equipment designed by Arthur Youngs (the owner's brother) in 1938. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act authorized the FDA to seize defective products; the first month the Act took effect in 1940, the FDA seized 864,000 condoms. While these actions improved the quality of condoms in the United States, American condom manufacturers continued to export their rejects for sale in foreign markets. =World War II to 1980= During World War II condoms were not only distributed to male U.S. military members, but enlisted men were also subject to significant contraception propaganda in the form of films, posters, and lectures. A number of slogans were coined by the military, with one film exhorting \\"Don't forget ‚Äî put it on before you put it in.\\" African-American soldiers, who served in segregated units, were exposed to less of the condom promotion programs, had lower rates of condom usage, and much higher rates of STDs. America's female military units, the WACs and WAACs, were still engaged with abstinence programs. European and Asian militaries on both sides of the conflict also provided condoms to their troops throughout the war, even Germany which outlawed all civilian use of condoms in 1941. Despite the rubber shortages that occurred during this period, condom manufacturing was never restricted. In part because condoms were readily available, soldiers found a number of non-sexual uses for the devices, many of which continue to be utilized to this day. Post-war American troops in Germany continued to receive condoms and materials promoting their use. Nevertheless, rates of STDs in this population began to rise, reaching the highest levels since World War I. One explanation is that the success of newer penicillin treatments led soldiers to take syphilis and gonorrhea much less seriously. A similar casual attitude toward STDs appeared in the general American population; one historian states that condoms \\"were almost obsolete as prophylaxis by 1960\\". By 1947, the U.S. military was again promoting abstinence as the only method of disease control for its members, a policy that continued through the Vietnam War. But condom sales continued to grow. From 1955 to 1965, 42% of Americans of reproductive age relied on condoms for birth control. In Britain from 1950 to 1960, 60% of married couples used condoms. For the more economical-minded, cement-dipped condoms continued to be available long after the war. In 1957, Durex introduced the world's first lubricated condom. Beginning in the 1960s, the Japanese used more condoms per capita than any other nation in the world. The birth control pill became the world's most popular method of birth control in the years after its 1960 debut, but condoms remained a strong second. A survey of British women between 1966 and 1970 found that the condom was the most popular birth control method with single women. New manufacturers appeared in the Soviet Union, which had never restricted condom sales. The U.S. Agency for International Development pushed condom use in developing countries to help solve the \\"world population crises\\": by 1970 hundreds of millions of condoms were being used each year in India alone. In the 1960s and 1970s quality regulations tightened, and legal barriers to condom use were removed. In 1965, the U.S. Supreme Court case Griswold v. Connecticut struck down one of the remaining Comstock laws, the bans of contraception in Connecticut and Massachusetts. France repealed its anti-birth control laws in 1967. Similar laws in Italy were declared unconstitutional in 1971. Captain Beate Uhse in Germany founded a birth control business, and fought a series of legal battles continue her sales. In Ireland, legal condom sales (only to people over 18, and only in clinics and pharmacies) were allowed for the first time in 1978. (All restrictions on Irish condom sales were lifted in 1993.) Advertising was one area that continued to have legal restrictions. In the late 1950s, the American National Association of Broadcasters banned condom advertisements from national television. This policy remained in place until 1979, when the U.S. Justice department had it overturned in court. In the U.S., advertisements for condoms were mostly limited to men's magazines such as Penthouse. The first television ad, on the California station KNTV, aired in 1975: it was quickly pulled after it attracted national attention. And in over 30 states, advertising condoms as birth control devices was still illegal. =After the discovery of AIDS= The first New York Times story on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was published on July 3, 1981. In 1982 it was first suggested that the disease was sexually transmitted. In response to these findings, and to fight the spread of AIDS, the U.S. Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop supported condom promotion programs. However, President Ronald Reagan preferred an approach of concentrating only on abstinence programs. Some opponents of condom programs stated that AIDS was a disease of homosexuals and illicit drug users, who were just getting what they deserved. In 1990, North Carolina senator Jesse Helms argued that the best way to fight AIDS would be to enforce state sodomy laws. Nevertheless, major advertising campaigns were put in print media, promoting condoms as a way to protect against AIDS. Youngs Rubber mailed educational pamphlets to American households, although the postal service forced them to go to court to do so, citing a section of Title 39 that \\"prohibits the mailing of unsolicited advertisements for contraceptives.\\" In 1983 the U.S. Supreme Court held that the postal service's actions violated the free speech clause of the First Amendment. Beginning in 1985 through 1987, national condom promotion campaigns occurred in U.S. and Europe. Over the 10 years of the Swiss campaign, Swiss condom use increased by 80%. The year after the British campaign began, condom sales in the UK increased by 20%. In 1988 Britain, condoms were the most popular birth control choice for married couples, for the first time since the introduction of the pill. The first condom commercial on U.S. television aired during an episode of Herman's Head on November 17, 1991. In the U.S. in the 1990s, condoms ranked third in popularity among married couples, and were a strong second among single women. Condoms began to be sold in a wider variety of retail outlets, including in supermarkets and in discount department stores such as Wal-Mart. In this environment of more open sales, the British euphemism of \\"a little something for the weekend\\" fell out of use. In June 1991 America's first condom store, Condomania, opened on Bleecker Street in New York City. Condomania was the first store of its kind in North America dedicated to the sale and promotion of condoms in an upbeat, upscale and fun atmosphere. Condomania was also one of the first retailers to offer condoms online when it launched its website in December 1995. Condom sales increased every year until 1994, when media attention to the AIDS pandemic began to decline. In response, manufacturers have changed the tone of their advertisements from scary to humorous. New developments continue to occur in the condom market, with the first polyurethane condom‚Äîbranded Avanti and produced by the manufacturer of Durex‚Äîintroduced in the 1990s. Durex was also the first condom brand to have a website, launched in 1997. Worldwide condom use is expected to continue to grow: one study predicted that developing nations would need 18.6 billion condoms in 2015. Etymology and other terms Etymological theories for the word \\"condom\\" abound. By the early 18th century, the invention and naming of the condom was attributed to an associate of England's King Charles II, and this explanation persisted for several centuries. However, the \\"Dr. Condom\\" or \\"Earl of Condom\\" described in these stories has never been proved to exist, and condoms had been used for over one hundred years before King Charles II ascended to the throne. A variety of Latin etymologies have been proposed, including condon (receptacle), condamina (house), and cumdum (scabbard or case). It has also been speculated to be from the Italian word guantone, derived from guanto, meaning glove. William E. Kruck wrote an article in 1981 concluding that, \\"As for the word 'condom', I need state only that its origin remains completely unknown, and there ends this search for an etymology.\\" Modern dictionaries may also list the etymology as \\"unknown\\". Other terms are also commonly used to describe condoms. In North America condoms are also commonly known as prophylactics, or rubbers. In Britain they may be called French letters. Additionally, condoms may be referred to using the manufacturer's name. The insult term scumbag was originally a slang word for condom.American Journal of Orthopsychiatry, American Orthopsychiatric Association, 1939 http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/28253/origin-of-scumbag Major manufacturers One analyst described the size of the condom market as something that \\"boggles the mind\\". Numerous small manufacturers, nonprofit groups, and government-run manufacturing plants exist around the world. Within the condom market, there are several major contributors, among them both for- profit businesses and philanthropic organizations. In 1882, German immigrant Julius Schmidt founded one of the largest and longest-lasting condom businesses, Julius Schmid, Inc., based in New York City. The condom lines manufactured by Schmid included Sheiks and Ramses. In 1932, the London Rubber Company (which had previously been a wholesale business importing German condoms) began to produce latex condoms, under the Durex brand. In 1962 Schmid was purchased by London Rubber. In 1987, London Rubber began acquiring other condom manufacturers, and within a few years became an important international company. In the late 1990s, London Rubber (by then London International Limited) merged all the Schmid brands into its European brand, Durex. Soon after, London International was purchased by Seton Scholl Healthcare (manufacturer of Dr. Scholl's footcare products), forming Seton Scholl Limited. Youngs Rubber Company, founded by Merle Youngs in late-19th-century America, introduced the Trojan line of condoms. In 1985, Youngs Rubber Company was sold to Carter-Wallace. The Trojan name switched hands yet again in 2000 when Carter-Wallace was sold to Church and Dwight. The Australian division of Dunlop Rubber began manufacturing condoms in the 1890s. In 1905, Dunlop sold its condom-making equipment to one of its employees, Eric Ansell, who founded Ansell Rubber. In 1969, Ansell was sold back to Dunlop. In 1987, English business magnate Richard Branson contracted with Ansell to help in a campaign against HIV and AIDS. Ansell agreed to manufacture the Mates brand of condom, to be sold at little or no profit in order to encourage condom use. Branson soon sold the Mates brand to Ansell, with royalty payments made annually to the charity Virgin Unite. In addition to its Mates brand, Ansell currently manufactures Lifestyles and Lifesan for the U.S. market. In 1934 the Kokusia Rubber Company was founded in Japan. It is now known as the Okamoto Rubber Manufacturing Company. In 1970 Tim Black and Philip Harvey founded Population Planning Associates (now known as Adam & Eve). Population Planning Associates was a mail-order business that marketed condoms to American college students, despite U.S. laws against sending contraceptives through the mail. Black and Harvey used the profits from their company to start a non-profit organization Population Services International. By 1975, PSI was marketing condoms in Kenya and Bangladesh, and today operates programs in over sixty countries. Harvey left his position as PSI's director in the late 1970s, but in the late 1980s again founded a nonprofit company, DKT International. Named after D.K. Tyagi (a leader of family planning programs in India), DKT International annually sells millions of condoms at discounted rates in developing countries around the world. By selling the condoms instead of giving them away, DKT intends to make its customers invested in using the devices. One of DKT's more notable programs is its work in Ethiopia, where soldiers are required to carry a condom every time they leave base. The rate of HIV infection in the Ethiopian military, about 5%, is believed to be the lowest among African militaries. In 1987, Tufts University students Davin Wedel and Adam Glickman started Global Protection Corp. in response to C. Everett Koop's statement that \\"a condoms can save your life.\\" Since that time, Global Protection Corp. has become known for its innovative approach to condom marketing and its support of more than 3500 non-profit organizations worldwide. The company has numerous patents and trademarks to its name, including the only FDA-approved glow-in-the-dark condom, the Pleasure Plus condom and the original condom keychain. In 2005 the company introduced its newest product, One Condoms. One represents a complete reinvention of retail condom brands, combining sleek metal packaging, innovative condom wrappers and innovative marketing programs. One is also the first condom brand to donate 5% of sales to the development of sexual health outreach and educational programs. In South Africa, some manufacturers have considered introducing an extra-large variety of condoms after several complaints from South African men claiming the condoms were too small and causing discomfort.

She became the second wife of Sir Anthony Browne Jr. and later the third wife of English admiral Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln. She was the inspiration for The Geraldine, a sonnet written by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey. Queen Elizabeth I of England, whom Lady Elizabeth served as a lady-in-waiting, was her close friend.  Family and early years  Lady Elizabeth FitzGerald was born in Maynooth, County Kildare, Leinster, Ireland, a daughter of Gerald \\"Gear√≥id √ìg\\" FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare, Lord Deputy of Ireland, and his second wife, Lady Elizabeth Grey. Her half-brother was Thomas \\"Silken Thomas\\" FitzGerald. Her paternal grandparents were Gerald Garret Mor FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare and Alison FitzEustace, and her maternal grandparents were Thomas Grey, 1st Marquis of Dorset and Cecily Bonville.Tudorplace.com.Kildare Her maternal great-grandmother was Queen Elizabeth Woodville. Lady Elizabeth was brought up at the Court of King Henry VIII of England as a companion to the infant Princess Elizabeth Tudor. She first arrived with her mother and one of her sisters in October 1533. In 1534, her father, who was imprisoned in the Tower of London on corruption charges, died on 12 December. In 1537, at the age of ten, she became immortalized by the poet Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey as \\"The Fair Geraldine\\" in his sonnet The Geraldine.Biographical Dictionary of English Literature The poet was said to have been captivated by her childish beauty, and composed it while he was briefly imprisoned for striking a courtier. There is no truth to the rumour that they were lovers as she was only ten years old at the time. Henry Howard's biographer, Jessie Childs, suggests that Surrey's purpose in writing the sonnet was to improve her opportunities of making a good marriage by praising not only her noble ancestry, but also her beauty and virtues.Kathy Lynn Emerson, A Who's Who of Tudor Women, retrieved 20 April 2010 Her younger brothers were raised alongside Prince Edward Tudor, who would later become King Edward VI of England. She was sent to the household of Princess Mary Tudor at Hunsdon following the execution of her half-brother, \\"Silken Thomas\\", and her five uncles for treason. Her eldest brother, Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare, had escaped to Ireland. In Donegal, Gerald with his aunt Lady Eleanor, new wife of Manus O'Donnell, along with other powerful Irish clans who were related to the FitzGeralds by marriage, formed the Geraldine League. When that federation was defeated in the Battle of Belahoe in Monaghan, he sought refuge on the Continent. He returned to England in the reign of King Edward VI, where he was welcomed at Court and his confiscated lands were returned to him.  Marriages  In 1543, at the age of sixteen, Lady Elizabeth married Sir Anthony Browne Jr. KG, following the death of his first wife, Alice Gage. Lady Elizabeth became stepmother to Browne's eight children, which included Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu, Mary Browne, and Mabel Browne, who would later marry Lady Elizabeth's brother, Gerald FitzGerald, also known as \\"The Wizard Earl\\". The Brownes were staunchly Roman Catholic. On 6 May 1548, Sir Anthony Browne died, leaving Lady Elizabeth a widow at the age of twenty-one. She had two children by Sir Anthony, but they both died young. On 1 October 1552, she married her second husband, Lord High Admiral Edward Clinton, at Sempringham, Kesteven, Lincolnshire. She was his third wife. Clinton was Lord-Lieutenant of Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire. He was also a Privy Counsellor. He was created 1st Earl of Lincoln in 1572 and served as Ambassador to France.  Friendship with Queen Elizabeth  Lady Elizabeth was a close intimate of Queen Elizabeth I of England. She had been a companion to the Queen when the latter was a baby; their friendship was later renewed in the household of the widowed Queen Consort, Catherine Parr, and her fourth husband, Thomas Seymour, where Lady Elizabeth went to live following Sir Anthony's death. They reportedly got on well together in the brief period they both resided at Chelsea Manor.Kathy Lynn Emerson, A Who's Who of Tudor Women, retrieved 19-04-10 In 1553, she and her second husband supported the plot to place Lady Jane Grey upon the throne in lieu of Princess Mary Tudor; Lady Jane also had been a member of Catherine Parr's household, so it is possible that Lady Elizabeth had developed a fondness for the young girl, which may have prompted her to back Jane's claim. When the plot failed, Lady Elizabeth and her husband managed to regain the trust of Princess Mary, who subsequently became queen. Shortly after the ascension of Queen Elizabeth I to the throne, following Queen Mary's death in 1558, Lady Elizabeth was at court as one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting.Emerson Elizabeth was one of those who, in 1561, had tried to warn Lady Catherine Grey to confess her clandestine marriage to Edward Seymour to the Queen before the latter discovered the truth from other people.Emerson That same year, Lady Elizabeth fell briefly into disfavour with the Queen and was accused of \\"frailty\\" and \\"forgetfulness of duty\\". These charges were made by the Archbishop of Canterbury Matthew Parker who also declared that she should be \\"chastised in Bridewell\\" for her \\"offences\\".EmersonTudor historian David Starkey concludes that Archbishop Parker considered Lady Elizabeth to have been a \\"strumpet\\".Emerson Lady Elizabeth afterwards regained her former favour with the Queen. Several years later, in 1569, Lady Elizabeth exercised her husband's rights as Lord High Admiral to seize a ship which had been illegally taken by Martin Frobisher. Frobisher was arrested for piracy and she was allowed to keep both the ship and its cargo.Emerson  Death  On an unknown date in March 1590, Elizabeth FitzGerald died at Lincoln in Lincolnshire, England. She is buried in St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. She had no children by her last husband. Portrait of Elizabeth FitzGerald, painted by an unknown artist, c.1575.

Filippi, L'arte dei mercanti di Calimala in Firenze ed il sua piu antico statute, (Turin: Fratelli Bocca) 1889; a recent study is A. Doren, (G.B. Klein, tr.) Le arte fiorentini, 1940; the first study in English was Edgcumbe Staley, The Guilds of Florence, 1906; a recent overview in English of the broad social context of the Florentine textiles and related industries is Carole Collier Frick, Dressing Renaissance Florence: Families, Fortunes, and Fine Clothing, Part I \\"Guilds and Labor\\", 2002. The ascendancy of the Calimala ran from the organization of Florentine guilds, each with its gonfaloniere in the thirteenth century, until the rise of the Medici usurped all other communal powers in the fifteenth century. Their presence is commemorated in the via di Calimala, leading away from the city's Roman forum (now Piazza della Republica) through the Mercato Nuovo to the former city gate, the Por Santa Maria, as the Roman cardo; the main street, as old as Florence itself, was a prime location for trade, even though, unpaved, crowded, and much narrower than its present state, it was truly a callis malis,Calismala is written at the head of an early set of statutes, according to E. Dixon, \\"The Florentine Wool Trades in the Middle Ages: A Bibliographical Note\\", Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, New Series, 12, (1898):151-179) p 151 note 1. an \\"ill passage-way\\". The name Calimala is of great antiquity and obscure etymology. Though the original earliest archives of the Arte di Calimala were lost in an 18th-century fire,Amy R, Bloch, \\"Lorenzo Ghiberti, the Arte di Calimala and fifteenth-century Florentine corporate patronage\\", in Daniel Ethan Bornstein and David Spencer Peterson, eds., Florence and beyond: culture, society and politics in Renaissance Italy: essays in honour of John M. Najemy 2008:143; Margaret Haines and Francesco Calioti, \\"Documenting the Gates of Paradise\\" in Gary M. Radke, Andrew Butterfield, The Gates of Paradise: Lorenzo Ghiberti's Renaissance masterpiece, 2007:80-98, esp. 85 note 4. abundant copies, preserved at the Archivio di Stato, Florence, document the guild's statutes and its activities.Copies of the lost early archives made by Carlo Strozzi (1587-1670) a 17th-century scholar, are in the Spoglie Strozziani in the Archivio di Stato.  Cloth Trade  The merchants of the arte di Calimala imported woollen cloth from northern France, from Flanders and Brabant, which was dyed, stretched, fulled, calendared and finished in Florence. Weaving was strictly the province of the Arte della Lana, who imported raw wool from England, but who, for their part, might dye but not otherwise finish any already-woven cloth. The woollen cloth trade was the engine that drove the city's economy. With the profits from the cloth trade, closely monitored by the Arte di Calimala itself, and usually constrained within the limitations on usury laid down by the Church, true capitalism emerged in Florence by the thirteenth century.Henri Eug√®ne S√©e, Modern capitalism: its origin and evolution ch, II \\"III. Early manifestations of capitalism in Florence\\" 1928 (reprinted). A small, not particularly outstanding 14th-century consortium or compagnia, that of Francesco del Bene and company, whose archives happen to have survived, was studied by Armando SaporiSapori, Una Compania di Calimali ai primi del trecento (Florence: Olschki) 1932. Francesco had two inactive partners, a bookkeeper and eight or ten factors, and handled about a bolt of cloth a day. On a larger scale, the compagnia of the merchant-bankers of the Scali family has also been examined, by Silvano Borsari.Borsari, Una compagnia di Calimala: Gli Scali (secc. XIII-XIV)(Macerata 1994). Scali interests extending to England, the source of the wool, led by degrees to their bankruptcy in 1326 in a liquidity crisis. The permissible profit over the primo costo, the asking price for cloth in the North, to which the added costs of God's penny, the maltolts owed the king of France, transportation to Paris, the center of the dyeing industry, warehousing, and gifts, tips and bribes along the way, resulted in the vero costo, the \\"real cost\\", both of which are alluded to in the Calimala statutes.Sapori 1932. a profit of 10 to 12 per cent was allowed, representing the \\"just price\\" that exercised the Church. The eagle on a bolt of cloth, symbol of the Arte di Calimala  History of Guild  The earliest documentation of the Arte di Calimala dates circa 1182, in which the Florentine cloth traders were among the first to band together in a confraternity to control the trade that was their livelihood. = Guild Members = Members of the Calimala were the elite of Florence. The capital required and the credit network that activated it, meant that members of the Calimala like the Scali turned naturally to banking to complement their activities as merchants, who might turn a profit in grain or in real estate holdings, or, like the Scali in 1326, might face bankruptcy proceedings in the merchants' court of the Mercanzia.The internal records not having survived, as they have for the Peruzzi, Bardi and Ricciardi, the bankruptcy proceedings of the Scali provided raw material for examining their trade operations, in Silvano Borsari, Una compagnia di Calimala: gli Scali (secc. XIII-XIV), Macerata: Universit√† degli Studi) 1994. The example of the Scali shows the long range of activities of the Arte di Calimala: the Scali were active in the 1220s in England, source of the wool that was woven in Flanders and Brabant; during the reign of Henry III they served as the principal financial intermediary between the King and the papal curia; thus after the battle of Montaperti (1260) the Scali were loyal Guelf adherents of the papal cause in Italy, until their prosperity was curtailed, as Pope Boniface VIII turned to other bankers of Florence and Pistoia, and the Ricciardi of Lucca became preferred bankers in England. With better fortunes in the early fourteenth century, the Scali were procuring wool in England and Burgundy, were active in France and Germany, with factors in Perugia, Milan and Venice, and exported grain from Apulia to Ragusa across the Adriatic, until a liquidity crisis brought them before the Mercanzia and briefly shook Florentine credit abroad. The late-14th century Palazzo dell'Arte di Calimala, seat of the guild = Meeting Place = Until 1237 the meeting place of the Arte di Calimala was in the ground floor of one of the tower houses of the Cavalcanti facing the Mercato Nuovo. Then at the end of the century a new palazzo was built in via Calimaruzza (illustration, right). The facade still bears the guild's insignia of the gilded eagle. Here the guild members met weekly to discuss and regulate their closely guarded and exclusive activities, placing all business contention before the council, with the resoundingly Roman name of the Collegio dei Consoli. The Consoli were required to be at least thirty years of age, to be Florentine by birth, needless to say, and to subscribe, in the civic politics, to the Guelph partisans. The guild supported its members, backed their credit in the city and abroad, provided an annuity to aged members and those of long standing, and cared for their widows and children. At its own expense the corporation maintained an armed night guard protecting the shops and warehouses, and interceded with innkeepers for the lodging of their foreign clients, a service that kept these stranieri under the Calimala's watchful eye. The Consuls of the Arte di Calimala were entrusted with maintaining the Baptistery of San Giovanni by the mid-twelfth century, according to Giovanni Villani; thus it was the Calimali that commissioned from Lorenzo Ghiberti the gilded bronze doors called the \\"Gates of Paradise\\" and the bronze statue of their patron, John the Baptist, for a niche at Orsanmichele. = Demise = The Arte di Calimala, for generations reduced to little more than a confraternity, was finally suppressed in 1770 by the enlightened despot Pietro Leopoldo, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who instituted in its stead a modern chamber of commerce, the Camera di Comercio, which lay more directly under his guidance.

Biography Crocker was born in Franklin, Indiana. He entered the United States Military Academy in 1847, but left at the end of his second year. He subsequently studied law and practiced in Des Moines, Iowa. With the outbreak of the Civil War, he entered the army as the captain of the 2nd Iowa Infantry in May 1861. He was promoted to colonel of the 13th Iowa Infantry on December 30, 1861. Crocker fought with distinction in the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, where he assumed command of a brigade during the first day. He commanded the \\"Iowa Brigade\\" at the Second Battle of Corinth in October, 1862. He was promoted to brigadier general on November 29, 1862. The following year, he participated in the Vicksburg Campaign, conducting a raid in Mississippi. Crocker had brought his brigade to a high state of discipline, and it was nicknamed \\"Crocker's Greyhounds\\" for its swift marching ability. After the re-enlistment of his brigade as veteran volunteers, he assumed command of a division when General Isaac F. Quinby went on sick leave. Crocker led his division into action at the Battle of Jackson. On the morning of May 16, General Quinby returned to duty. However it was deemed necessary to retain Crocker in command of the division as it was deploying for battle at Champion Hill. Crocker received praise for his actions in that battle. Throughout his military career Crocker suffered from consumption, which he referred to as \\"my old bronchial difficulty.\\" He became very ill en route to join the army of William T.

Watts, 1986) The Miss Pickerell series MacGregor is best known as an author from the Miss Pickerell children's science fiction series, although only four of them were published in her lifetime. She left sufficient notes on planned future novels to enable Dora Pantell to write and publish Miss Pickerell books, the last one, Miss Pickerell and the Lost World, appearing in 1986. Miss Lavinia Pickerell is an unlikely heroine: prim, spinsterly, angular and stiff, wearing old‚Äëfashioned clothes and an outlandish hat, and devoted to her pet cow, she nevertheless manages to inadvertently stowaway on a rocket to Mars in her first adventure. But with her common-sense, practicality, and unflappable demeanor she manages to bring each adventure to a satisfactory conclusion. She is every child's favorite maiden aunt, and is possibly modeled after MacGregor herself. The series resembles others that are written by other writers long after the deaths of their creators, such as Tom Swift and Nancy Drew.

The novel is about a crime journalist, Zsigmond Gordon, who wants to find the killer of a Jewish girl found dead in Budapest in 1936, and besides the criminal element offers social commentary, political and historical background of Hungary flirting with Fascism. Plot introduction Budapest, October 1936. Prime Minister Gyula G√∂mb√∂s is dead. The body of a young Jewish girl is found in a Ter√©zv√°ros doorway. Zsigmond Gordon, a criminal journalist for The Est newspaper, arrives on the scene soon afterwards and starts asking questions, but everywhere seems to run into a brick wall. The clues lead him upwards to the highest echelons of society and downwards to the lowest depths of misery and poverty. Gordon refuses to give up, keeps asking his questions, and the more they want to frighten him off, the more determined he becomes. He doesn't know whom to trust, and doesn't know and doesn't care how many people's interests he is harming. He just wants to find the girl's killer, because, by the look of things, he's the only one who cares.

Education  Lam attended St. Joseph's College (class of 1969) and graduated in Mechanical Engineering from Tufts University in the United States. Career  He is managing director of Forward Winsome Industries, a toy manufacturer. He is also a General committee member of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Hong Kong Industries. In the 2004 Legislative Council election, he represented the Liberal Party to run in the Commercial (First) functional constituency whose electors were the members of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, as incumbent James Tien, chairman of the Liberal Party, ran for direct election in the New Territories East.

Birth of Greek Opera. \\"San Giacomo and Greek ottocento\\" XI Convegno Annuale di Societ√† Italiana di Musicologia Lecce, 22‚Äì24 October 2004. Archive from 16 October 2015 (accessed 4 December 2017). Quotes: \\"Originally it functioned as the loggia of the island‚Äôs Venetian nobility, but in 1720 it was converted into a theatre, which, despite being one more theatre in the provinces of Serenissima, became the first modern theatre on Greek soil.\\" - \\"These activities are of particular importance for the music history of modern Greece, since in an era when there was not such a thing as Greek State in Greek Mainland (let alone organized musical activities).\\" - \\"San Giacomo gradually acted as a pole that could hold in Corfu adequate and often well-qualified players and teachers from Italy. This resulted to the increasing interest towards music, a fact that had both cultural and social roots, and to the gradual emergence of a series of indigenous players, becoming this way the first professional musicians of modern Greece.\\" - \\"Our knowledge for the activities of San Giacomo was until recently very limited, mainly due to the loss of its valuable archive during a German bombing in 1943.\\" - \\"Spiridon Xindas is widely known as the composer of the opera O ypopsifios (1867), the first opera on Greek libretto.\\" - \\"In 1867 the opera O Ypopsifios [The Parliamentary Candidate] was performed in San Giacomo by local amateurs. This was the first opera to use a full-scale libretto in Greek and which shows the creative assimilation of Italian and Greek musical perspectives in the Ionians.\\" Despite its provincial origins it attracted Italian musicians and composers, many of whom became permanent residents of Corfu and contributed to the local music scene. The theatre acted as a catalyst in this cultural interaction and gave impetus to the development of the Ionian School of Music. Corfiot composer Nikolaos Halikiopoulos Mantzaros was a beneficiary of the synergy between the Italian and Corfiot musical traditions.  History  Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo was named after a Catholic cathedral in Corfu. Established in 1693, during the Republic of Venice period, as a gathering place of the Venetian nobility of Corfu it was converted into a theatre in 1720 and became the first modern theatre to be established in Greece. Initially the theatre staged theatrical plays but in 1733 an opera was performed there for the first time. The opera was A. Aurelli‚Äôs Gerone, tiranno di Siracusa. The operas were continuously staged especially between 1771 and 1892 when the theatre was converted to a City Hall. The Municipal Theatre of Corfu, which in early 20th century replaced the legendary Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo (which was converted into Town Hall). This photograph shows the theatre prior to the 1943 Luftwaffe bombardment and its subsequent destruction during World War II. The musical tradition established by the theatre is especially important to the history of modern Greek music since it helped establish a Greek musical presence at a time when the Greek State did not even exist. The theatre staged the type of comic opera known as opera buffa which was less elaborate and therefore more economical than the full-fledged opera seria. San Giacomo's opera crews were mainly from southern Italy. The historic stage curtain of Teatro di San Giacomo depicting a scene from the Odyssey The opera house functioned during times of upheaval unabated as, for example, during the arrival of the French in 1797. In 1799, during the Russia-Ottoman siege, the theatre continued its performances even as the foreign opera troupe was unable to leave the island due to the blockade. The performance at such a challenging time was used as a means for propaganda and to raise the morale of the population. The theatre attracted many Italian professional musicians who came to Corfu as teachers as well as composers and performers. This had the effect of generating an appreciation for music among the locals and this gradually led to the appearance of the first Corfiot music professionals who, in turn, became the first professional musicians of modern Greece. Corfiot Spyridon Xyndas, for example, wrote the Greek opera O ypopsifios (The Parliamentary Candidate) which became the first opera composed on an exclusively Greek libretto and was performed at San Giacomo in 1867.San Simera - Biography of Spyridon Xyndas (in Greek) - Translated quote: \\"His most famous opera is the \\"Parliamentary Candidate\\" which premiered in 1867 at the San Giacomo theatre of Corfu.\\"Ionian Islands Culture - Quote: \\"In 1867 in San Giacomo theatre in Corfu premiers the first opera of Xyndas with a social critique topic entitled ‚ÄúParliament Candidate‚Äù which was the first melodrama ever written by a Greek composer on a totally Greek libretto (of Ioannis Rinopoulos).\\" The oral tradition held that operatic performers who found success at the theatre were distinguished with the accolade applaudito in Corf√∫ (\\"applauded in Corfu\\") as a tribute to the discriminating musical taste of the island audience.Corfu - History of the Municipal Theatre via the Internet Archive The theatre was replaced by the Municipal Theatre of Corfu in 1902. The Municipal Theatre and its historical archives, many of which belonged to Teatro di San Giacomo, were destroyed during a Luftwaffe bombing raid in 1943.

A second and slightly later Bangor neighborhood of primarily elite houses, centered on West Broadway, is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Whitney Park Historic District. Both historic districts are also protected under local ordinance. Broadway reflects Bangor's aspirations, in the 1820s-1830s, to become one of the chief port cities in New England, if not the East Coast. It was laid out roughly on the model of Boston's Beacon Hill, with a green strip running down the center for the first two blocks, planted with a double row of elm trees. A few blocks further on, the street bisects a large park (Broadway Park), which is the terminus of the historic district. The district also includes some immediate side streets of equal status, notably French Street, whose houses overlooked downtown Bangor from a bluff. The first residences built along the street's green strip in the 1820s-30s were large brick double- houses and single-houses, again conformed to the city-scape of Boston. Typical of these early houses are the Hinkley House, a brick duplex built in the 1820s, and Fred Dickey House, an elegant Federal style house built in 1807. Within the first decade, however, brick had given way to fully detached wooden mansions, though the size and stylistic ambitions of the owners didn't diminish. The district features houses built in every period and style from the 1820s through the early 20th century (e.g. Greek Revival, Italianate, Second Empire, Colonial Revival, etc.). Part of the district was devastated by the Great Fire of 1911, and although most of the burned section was rebuilt, Broadway began to be abandoned as newer and more attractive elite neighborhoods began to open up (e.g. Little City and Fairmount Park). The construction of the large Catholic John Bapst High School in the center of the district in the 1920s, for which a number of mansions were demolished, was likely the tipping point in the neighborhood's conversion to mixed use.

It consisted of one or two people onscreen who read and reacted to mobile phone text messages sent in by viewers and seen in real time on-screen. The onscreen personalities were usually accompanied by an off-screen producer, who engaged with those onscreen in conversation about a variety of topics. The program aired at 1:30 to 4:30am Monday-Friday and 2 to 4:30am Saturday-Sunday in the Lansing and West Michigan areas, eventually expanding to parts of Maryland, Delaware, Louisiana, and Indiana, and also streamed live on the web via their official website. The show was created by Torkel Bergst√∏l at Active Loop Television in Norway as Sticky TV, and adapted for a US audience by James Ford Robinson, in partnership with WLAJ in Lansing. The hosts were all local college talent. On November 5, 2008, after 622 shows and 1,972 total on-air hours, the show was cancelled, leaving hosts, fans, and texters in the dark as to why the show was so abruptly cancelled. An e-mail by one of the loyal texters of the show sent to the Oslo, Norway, production company asked about the cancellation. The response was that the company and its partner were still working on ways to bring the show back and that it could return in the near future with a more stable financial partner. WLAJ's General Manager echoed this sentiment, saying, \\"I would love to continue to run the show if the Text Me TV folks want to get back into it.\\" List of Hosts Current at the Time of Cancellation *Amariee Woods *Cassie Little *Helena Kirby *Logic (Joseph Harris) *Mike Zamora *Tony Guastella * Phil Wright Former Hosts * Chris (moderator) * Craig (moderator) *Danielle (moderator) *Julia (moderator) * Jessa Marsh * \\"Legsy\\" Megsy (Meghan) * Nicole * Vanessa Ilise External links *Official Text Me TV site no longer online *Official Text Me TV Myspace Page *Official WLAJ site *Official Webpage of Jessa Marsh no longer online *Jeffrey R.

Station layout Naka-Oguni Station has one side platform serving a single bidirectional track. The station is unattended. History The station opened on October 21, 1958, as a station on the Japanese National Railways (JNR). With the privatization of JNR on April 1, 1987, it came under the operational control of JR East. With the opening of the Tsugaru Kaiky≈ç Line on March 13, 1988, operation of the station was shared between JR East and JR Hokkaido, and the station was regarded as the southern starting point of the Tsugaru Kaiky≈ç Line for the determination of railway fares, although no trains of Kaiky≈ç Line stopped at the station, and the effective southern terminus for all Tsugaru Kaiky≈ç Line trains was at Aomori Station. Services on the Tsugaru Kaiky≈ç ceased on March 26, 2016 when the Hokkaido Shinkansen opened and replaced regular passenger services connecting Aomori and Hakodate. Surrounding area Shinnakaoguni Junction is located 2.3 km north of Naka-Oguni, between Naka-Oguni and ≈ådai / Tsugaru- Imabetsu. Up until this point, the Tsugaru Line and Kaiky≈ç Line shared the same tracks from Aomori Station.

Also known as rusty woodsia or rusty cliff fern, it is typically found on sunny, exposed cliffs and rocky slopes and on thin, dry, acidic soils. Distribution Its distribution is circumpolar and is most abundant in Scandinavia, the Ural and Altai mountains and the eastern United States. It is also found in Japan, Alaska, Canada, coastal Greenland and various European locations including the Alps. It is considered \\"Threatened\\" or \\"Endangered\\" in the states of Illinois, Iowa, and Maryland and \\"Presumed Extirpated\\" in Ohio. Also found in West Virginia and North Carolina, it is the most common Woodsia species in the US. Its UK distribution is confined to Angus and the Moffat Hills in Scotland, north Wales and Teesdale and the Lake District in England. There are fewer than 90 wild clumps in the whole of the UK, where it is on the edge of its natural range and is considered to be \\"Endangered\\". For this reason it became a protected species in the UK in 1975 under the Conservation of Wild Creatures and Wild Plants Act. Discovery and identification The plant was first identified as a separate species from specimens collected in Scotland in Bolton's 1785 publication '. Bolton distinguished between Acrostichum ilvense and Acrostichum alpina, now Woodsia ilvensis and Woodsia alpina respectively, which had previously been conflated. The genus Woodsia was established in 1810 by Robert Brown, who named it named after the English botanist Joseph Woods. \\"'\\" is the genitive form of the Latin name for the island of Elba. The leaves are typically 6 inches long and 1 inch wide, with stiff, erected pointed tips and cut into 12 nearly opposite stemless leaflets. The underside of the leaves are covered in white woolly fibres, which later turn rusty brown. Victorian collectors and modern conservation Oblong woodsia came under severe threat from Victorian fern collectors in the mid 19th century in Scotland, especially in the Moffat Hills. These hills once had the most extensive UK populations of the species but there now remain only a few small colonies whose future is under threat. This period of collecting became known as pteridomania (or \\"fern-fever\\"). The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh plan to use cultivated specimens and a spore bank to restore depleted wild populations.

As a younger son of Louis XIV, Philippe-Charles was not expected to become the Dauphin; however, it was hoped he would inherit the vast fortune of his second cousin, Anne Marie Louise d'Orl√©ans, Duchess of Montpensier, who had no children.

The name is taken from the Hunan region where the Army was raised. The Army was financed through local nobles and gentry, as opposed to through the centralized Manchu-led Qing dynasty. The army was mostly disbanded by Zeng after the re-capture of the Taiping capital at Nanking. Although it was raised specifically to address problems in Hunan, the Army formed the core of the new Qing military establishment, and as such, forever weakened the Manchu influence within the military. This devolution of centralized command is commonly pointed to as a major reason for the eventual downfall of the Qing and the emergence of regional warlordism in China during the first half of the twentieth century. The Xiang Army was one of two armies known as the Hunan Army. Another Hunan Army, called the Chu Army, was created by former Xiang commander Zuo Zongtang to fight in the Dungan Revolt (1862‚Äì77). Remnants of the Xiang Army which also fought in the war were then called the \\"Old Hunan Army\\". History The Xiang Army recapturing Jinling, a suburb of the Taiping capital, July 19, 1864 =Taiping Rebellion= The Taiping rebellion started in December 1850 in Guangxi Province, growing after a series of small victories over the local Qing forces. The revolt rapidly spread northward. In March 1853, between 700,000 and 800,000 Taiping soldiers directed by commander-in-chief Yang Xiuqing took Nanjing, killing 30,000 Manchu civilians and bannermen. The city became the movement's capital and was renamed Tianjing (\\"Heavenly Capital\\"). By this point the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom encompassed much of south and central China, centered on the Yangtze river valley. They continued in their attempts to expand northward, and sent two armies to take the upper Yangtze, while another two attempted to take the new Imperial capital, Beijing. The western drive met with some success, but the Beijing attack failed. =Creation= Zeng Guofan was tasked with limiting the rebel's attempts to take control of Hunan. In 1852 he was appointed by the Qing court as commissioner of militia organization for Central China. Zeng Guofan expanded the pre-existing tuanlian militia into an armed force with a total of 17,000 men, including thirteen battalions consisting of 6500 men and a navy of ten battalions consisting of 5000 men. It was given the name of Xiang Army, with Zeng Guofan as the Commander-in-chief, accepting orders from Zeng alone. The new rule was termed \\"Soldiers followed the general, soldiers belonged to the general\\"(), contrary to the old military rule before the Northern Song Dynasty's \\"Soldiers had no fixed commander, commander had no fixed soldiers\\" (). This new military rule was the direct cause of the Warlord era. These Tuanlian were turned into the Yong Ying Xiang Army. In order to fund the army, Zeng convinced the Hunan governor to divert funds from the provincial network of commercial good toll collection stations. Eventually the army founds ways of collecting funds from local landholders and merchants. =Campaigns= His lieutenants recovered the capital, Changsha, and then Zeng led the recapture of Wuchang and Hanyang, near Hankow, and was rewarded for his success by being appointed vice-president of the Board of War. His Army was so successful that the Qing leaders quickly started using it in place of their own troops, turning it into an Imperial force rather than the local force as it had been raised. In 1860 Zeng was called on to use the Xiang Army to clear Anhui, and was appointed Viceroy of Liangjiang (‰∏§Ê±üÊÄªÁù£, which consisted of the provinces of Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu). While Charles George Gordon and his \\"Ever- Victorious Army\\" were clearing the rebel heartland, Zeng took the opportunity to launch a campaign to retake Nanjing. The entire area around the city had been cleared of rebel forces in a series of battles starting in June 1863. The battle for the city itself started on March 14, 1864 when Zeng's forces attempted to force the city walls using ladders, but were beaten back. A second attempt used tunnels, but counter-digging and a second wall prevented a breakthrough. On July 3 the Xiang forces had their first victory, taking Dibao Castle. This position allowed them to dig new tunnels and pack them with explosives with the intention of destroying the city walls. A counterattack failed, and on July 19 the explosives were set off, collapsing a large portion of the wall. The city fell after a fierce three-day battle. The Xiang Army pillaged and robbed the city, killing 100,000 Taiping soldiers and civilians according to Zeng Guofan and setting it on fire. The city burned until July 26, 1864. Zeng was promoted to Marquess (of the First Class) Yiyong () (Yiyong: ÊØÖ = Endurance Âãá = Courage) . Almost immediately after the capture of Nanking, Zeng disbanded the 120,000 soldiers under his command, although Zuo kept his forces intact. Viceroys After the fall of the Taiping, in from 1864 to 1890, over half of the viceroys in China were Xiang Army leaders. Total soldiers In 1860, the power of the Xiang Army was unsurpassed, totalling almost 360,000 soldiers. The large main group was led by Zeng Guofan with 130,000 troops. The Qing regular army, the Green Standard Army, totaled about 2,300,000 (included the Xiang Army). Taiping Rebellion soldiers amounted to about 1,800,000 (including 300,000 local gang members who repeatedly changed sides). After 1864 a significant portion of the Army was disbanded on orders from Zeng. However at units under Zuo Zongtang continue to exist. They numbered around 120,000 by the 1870s. The Xiang Army also had a small naval army. Headquarters Headquarters were located in Qimen County, Anhui from 1853 to 1861. After recovering Anqing in September 1861, the headquarters was moved there because of its proximity to Nanjing. Salary One of Zeng Guofan's priorities for the Xiang Army was finance, understanding that good pay was crucial for battlefield morale. As a result, a Xiang Army soldier's salary was four tael of silver every month, compared to a regular Green Standard soldier's salary of about 1.5 tael of silver per month. Main leaders *Zeng Guofan *Zuo Zongtang *Zeng Guoquan () *Hu Linyi () *Luo Zenan () *Peng Yulin () After the Taiping Rebellion was crushed, the Hunan armies petitioned to the Manchu Court to disband themselves, for fear of rumored rebellion against the Manchus as they had grown too powerful in the eyes of the Manchus. The Manchu Court only agreed to turn Peng Yulin's army into a navy.

In 1890, part of the Xiang Army incorporated into a gang and anti-government movement. When the Xinhai Revolution (Chinese Revolution) began in 1911, former comrades of Xiang Army turned against each other. The Republic of China was established on February 12, 1912.

Overview The book was published in 1977. Sampson describes how the \\"defence industry\\" grew uncontrollably. Sampson explains how the system produces a \\"growing frenzy to push weapons into the new markets\\". He mentions the role of governments and the development of the arms salesman. He describes the private manufacture of arms. The book begins by describing how the arms industry was changed by the industrial revolution and mass production, and the accomplishments of the Swedish born scientist Alfred Nobel and how he influenced the business through his invention of nitroglycerin and later on dynamite. While describing Nobel, the author also describes the Swedish defence contractors like Bofors which was owned by Nobel and Saab AB. The book largely discusses the beginning of U.S arms export during the Cold war under the auspices of the then Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to reverse the deficit in the balance of payment. It shows how actually The Pentagon helped the American defense contractors to make weapons sales to the Nato allies in Europe instead of providing them with direct security. It examines what went wrong to the sale of Lockheed Martin F-104 Starfighter to West Germany and Netherlands. The Luftwaffe lost more than 300 Starfighters during training and operation. The sales of Northrop F-5 Tiger is also considered. The book also explains how American companies used the connections of the Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and used bribery to make a lucrative arms sales to the oil rich Saudi Arabia. Saudis during the time were booming with the oil money and were eager buyers of American weapons. The book continues about CIA, Kermit Roosevelt, and arms sales to the Mohammad Reza Shah.

From October 2012 to October 2016, he was the chairman of Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong (BPA), the second largest party in the legislature. Early life and education Leung was born on 24 February 1951 to a family who run a textile factory, the Sun Hing knitting company. He was educated in the University of Leeds and joined his father's family business. In 1970, he set up the Sun Hing Knitting Factory in Kwai Chung and became the chairman of the company. Public service career Leung joined the Hong Kong Woollen & Synthetic Knitting Manufacturers' Association, the chamber of commerce of the manufacturing companies, in which he later became the honorary president in 1997. He has been the chairman and Honorary Chairman of the Textile Council of Hong Kong and the member, Deputy chairman and Chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries. He stepped down in 2004 after he was elected to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong and became the Honorary chairman. He has been the committee member of both Textile and Clothing Industry Training Board in the 1980s, and became a member of Vocational Training Council (VTC) board of directors in 1998, he was then appointed as the chairman of VTC from 2006 to 2012. He has also held many positions including Chairman of the Hong Kong Productivity Council (2003‚Äì2009), council member of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (2010‚Äì2016), a member of the Economic Development Commission (2013‚Äì2017), the Deputy Chairman of the Business Facilitation Advisory Committee (2012‚Äì2016), a non-executive director of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (2009‚Äì2015) and a Director of The Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited. He was awarded Justice of the Peace in 1996 and Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his services to the textile industry in 1997. Legislative Councillor In the 2004 Legislative Council election, he replaced Kenneth Ting Woo-shou to be elected uncontestedly to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong through the Industrial (First) functional constituency which was elected by the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, representing the Liberal Party. Leung split apart from the Liberal Party in October 2008 with Jeffrey Lam Kin-fung and Sophie Leung Lau Yau-fun after the defeat of the party in the 2008 Legislative Council election in September and the resignation of chairman James Tien Pei-chun. In June 2009, the three legislators formed the Economic Synergy which later co-founded the Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong (BPA) in 2012 which Leung became the founding Chairman of the new party. Leung was also the committee member of 11th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He received the Silver Bauhinia Star (SBS) and the Gold Bauhinia Star (GBS) in 2004 and 2010 respectively. On the debate over the 2014‚Äì15 Hong Kong electoral reform for the universal suffrage of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Leung opposed to the Occupy Central with Love and Peace campaign by the pan-democracy camp, appealed to the \\"silent majority\\" to oppose \\"Occupy protest\\". Leung said the campaign would threaten the rule of law and social stability, while hurting Hong Kong's business environment. President of the Legislative Council After the 2016 Hong Kong Legislative Election, Leung was handpicked by the pro-Beijing camp to be their candidate for the President of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong left over by the retiring Jasper Tsang, after potential candidates New People's Party's Michael Tien and nonpartisan Paul Tse withdrew their nominations, implicitly citing the influence of the Liaison Office. Leung was questioned by the opposition over his British nationality which he renounced right before the vote and his close business ties with 11 companies in which he held shares and was the directors of seven of them. On the first meeting of the Legislative Council, Leung was elected as president in the middle of chaos as the pan-democrats and localists tore up their ballot papers and stormed out of the meeting room before the vote. As a result, Leung received 38 votes against pro-democrat nominee James To's zero with three blank ballots. On 27 October, Leung was slammed and asked to step down after he took a U-turn by deciding to delay the oath-taking of Sixtus Leung and Yau Wai-ching of Youngspiration whose qualifications were under legal challenge by the government for their pro- independence on general meeting on 27 October 2016. Leung and Yau inserted their own words into the oath-taking on the first session of the Legislative Council and therefore were invalidated by the LegCo secretary-general Kenneth Chen. Andrew Leung initially allowed the two to retake the oaths but backed down after the pro-Beijing camp threatened to stage a second walkout after they walked out in the on 19 October to block the two Youngspiration legislators to take the oaths. The pan-democracy camp criticised Leung for \\"unfit to perform his role\\". Personal life His wife, Susana Cheong Suk- hing, is the sister of former member of the Legislative Council Stephen Cheong.

Photo taken in 2011 Osvobozen√© divadlo (1926‚Äì1938) (Liberated Theatre or Prague Free Theatre) was a Prague avant-garde theatre scene founded as the theatre section of an association of Czech avant-garde artists Devƒõtsil (Butterbur) in 1926. The theatre's beginnings were strongly influenced by Dadaism and Futurism, later by Poetism (a specific Czech art movement). The theatre was very leftist oriented, but it could also be critical of the Communists.Voskovec and Werich - enduring symbols of pre-war Czechoslovak culture - 11-02-2005 13:50 UTC - Radio Prague One of the founders, Ji≈ô√≠ Frejka, came up with the name in 1926. In the theatre both authorial plays and works by well-established modern authors; such as G. Apollinaire, A. Jarry, J. Cocteau, A. Breton, F. T. Marinetti, and V. Nezval were performed. The modern conception of the scene also laid more emphasis on lighting and the theatrical conception adjured more cooperation and contacts between actors and audience.  History  Beginnings = Ji≈ô√≠ Voskovec (left) in the film Poh√°dka m√°je, 1926 The first performance took place on February 8, 1926, with the play Georges Dandin by Moli√®re (it was renamed Cirkus Dandin), the performance was not very successful.Holzknecht, p. 63 In 1927 the theatre moved to Umƒõleck√° beseda and in that time Ji≈ô√≠ Voskovec and Jan Werich first appeared on the stage with their own play Vest Pocket Revue, a montage of Dadaist gags, intellectual humour and jazz songs. The performance achieved great acclaim and Werich, together with Voskovec, became part of the ensemble. In the same year the young pianist and composer Jaroslav Je≈æek joined them, and together with Werich and Voskovec represented the core of the theatre group during its whole existence. They used masks inspired by the Fratellini clowns; Voskovec's mask was inspired by Fran√ßois Fratellini and Werich's by Albert Fratellini. Ji≈ô√≠ Frejka together with another important exponent and founder, E. F. Burian, left the theatre due to disputes with the director Jind≈ôich Honzl, an avant- garde theatre theorist who directed all the plays of the Osvobozen√© divadlo. The foursome (Voskovec, Werich, Je≈æek, and Honzl), but mainly Voskovec and Werich, gradually became the most important part of the group and their cooperation and contribution is still considered as very distinctive and legendary.Voskovec and Werich: a fruitful cooperation that continued across the Atlantic - 15-02-2007 14:57 UTC - Radio Prague The performances of Osvobozen√© divadlo up to 1932 were predominantly of an entertaining character. The programme was rehearsed very loosely; it was based mainly on improvisation and was also dependent on reactions of the audience. V+W in their plays worked chiefly with historical themes and exotic places (plays Sever proti jihu, Golem, Nebe na zemi, Fata morgana, Ostrov Dynamit, Smoking Revue); the performances were richly accompanied by Je≈æek's jazz-influenced music and songs. In 1931 Je≈æek also established a partnership with Karel Anƒçerl, later chief of the Czech Philharmonic. Anƒçerl worked in the theatre as a conductor till 1933, and markedly improved the theatre orchestra.Holzknecht, p. 301 Osvobozen√© divadlo also introduced so-called \\"forb√≠ny\\" (from the German Vorb√ºhne - forestage, front piece) - improvised dialogues on the forestage, often presenting topical reactions to political and cultural events and subjects. In 1932 V+W came up with the first explicitly political play, Caesar. In that very successful play (191 reprisesC√≠sa≈ô, p. 258), the authors for the first time warned against the danger of Nazism, and the theatre began to be regarded as political. Another strongly anti-fascist play, Osel a st√≠n (The Ass and the Shadow; 1933), was also very leftist-oriented. In 1934 Osvobozen√© divadlo began to present another play, Kat a bl√°zen, whose criticism of Nazism was very sharp, straight and consistent. The play had problems with censorship, and the German embassy lodged strong protests with the Umƒõleck√° beseda management. After continuing complaints from German officials Osvobozen√© divadlo was expelled from the Umƒõleck√° beseda building U Nov√°k≈Ø Palace in 1935. = Spoutan√© divadlo (\\"The Tied Theatre\\") = The theatre was renamed after the expulsion to Spoutan√© divadlo and settled in the Rokoko Theatre in Wenceslas Square. In a one-year period the plays Balada z hadr≈Ø (play about F. Villon), Tƒõ≈æk√° Barbora etc. were created. = Osvobozen√© divadlo again = Ji≈ô√≠ Traxler and Jaroslav Je≈æek (right) in 1938 In 1936, after the triumph of the play Balada z hadr≈Ø, Osvobozen√© divadlo came back to U Nov√°k≈Ø Palace, but other anti-Nazi plays - Svƒõt za m≈ô√≠≈æemi, Pƒõst na oko and above all Kat a bl√°zen, whose performance led to demonstrations by the fascist element in the audience, led to a prohibition of all activities. The theatre was officially closed on November 10, 1938,Holzknecht, p. 88 and in January 1939 Voskovec, Werich and Je≈æek were forced to emigrate to the United States. = 1946-1948 = After World War II. Werich and Voskovec (Je≈æek died in 1942 in New York City) came back from exile and attempted to restore Osvobozen√© divadlo, but the social atmosphere in post-war Czechoslovakia was different and not very friendly towards their kind of satire. After the communist putch in 1948 occurred, Voskovec emigrated again and the activity of the theatre completely ceased.  Significance  Osvobozen√© divadlo represented an important part of the Czechoslovakia First Republic cultural scene. It was the place where many theatre experiments occurred. Archive recordings of plays and particularly of Je≈æek's music and songs are popular and reissued till now.

In Wittenberg he became a follower of Martin Luther, and stayed in touch with the Protestant Reformation when he relocated to Neisse (Nysa) in 1513 as the secretary of Johannes V. Thurzo, bishop of Breslau. In 1518 He√ü moved to Bologna to study theology, completing his studies there in 1519. On the way back to Silesia he stopped in Wittenberg and became a friend of Philipp Melanchthon. In 1520 he was ordained to the priesthood and in 1523 He√ü was pressed by the city council of Breslau (probably at the instigation of Laurentius Corvinus) to become pastor of St. Maria Magdalena church. In the coming years he slowly introduced Protestant teachings in Breslau, presenting his ideas in a disputation at St Dorothy's monastery at Breslau in 1524. His careful approach even normalized the relationship to Catholic bishop Jakob von Salza. Theologically he, Ambrosius Moibanus, pastor of St. Elisabeth church, and the city council of Breslau sided with Wittenberg and opposed Caspar Schwenckfeld and his followers in Liegnitz (Legnica). In 1541 he took part in the Conference of Regensburg. In 1547 He√ü died in Breslau.

DI Khan is home to the collection of Hindu ruins at two separate sites 20 miles apart, jointly known as Kafir Kot. The region came under the influence of the Nanda Empire of ancient India from 300 BCE, and with the rise of Chandragupta Maurya, the region came under the complete control of the Mauryan Empire. Afterward, the region was briefly and nominally controlled by the Shunga Empire. However, with the decline of the Shungas, the region passed to local Hindu and Buddhist rulers, and interrupted by foreign rulers. Many of these foreign rulers, like the Indo-Parthians, Sakas, and Kushans converted to Hinduism and Buddhism, and promoted these Indian religions throughout Central and South Asia. The region reached its height under the Buddhist ruler Kanishka the Great. After the fall of the Kushans, the region came under the control of the Gupta Empire of ancient India. During the period, Hindu and Buddhist art and architecture flourished in the area.https://www.google.com/books/edition/Ancient_Pakistan/R4jiAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv;=1&bsq;=Dera+Ismail+Khan+hindu+shahi&dq;=Dera+Ismail+Khan+hindu+shahi&printsec;=frontcover With the decline of the imperial Guptas, the Hindu Shahis came to rule the area. The Hindu Shahis built two massive forts in the northern edges of Dera Ismail Khan. The forts were later renamed as \\"Kafirkots\\" (forts of the infidel). These Hindu Shahi forts were known for high towers and steep defensive walls. The Hindus also built many Hindu temples around the area, however, much of them are now in rubble. The Hindu Shahis remained in control of the area until their defeat by the Turkic Muslim army of Ghaznavids.https://www.google.com/books/edition/Ancient_Pakistan/R4jiAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv;=1&bsq;=Dera+Ismail+Khan+hindu+shahi&dq;=Dera+Ismail+Khan+hindu+shahi&printsec;=frontcover The Tehsil is part of what was historically territory inhabited by the Baluch people during medieval India, who were invited to settle the region by Shah Husseyn, of the Langah Sultanate of Multan. These Baluch settlers were displaced by, or assimilated into, later waves of Pashtun settlement. During British rule in colonial India, Dera Ismail Khan was the chief tehsil of the old Dera Ismail Khan District. The population was 144,337 according to the 1901 census an increase of almost 11,000 since the 1891 census (133,809) - it was headquartered at the town of Dera Ismail Khan and contained 250 villages.Dera Ismail KhƒÅn Tahsƒ´l - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 11, p. 268.  Politics  Dera Ismail Khan is represented in the National Assembly of Pakistan through two seats which are NA-24 (D I Khan) and NA-25 (D I Khan cum Tank). The incumbent on these seats are Moulana Fazul Rehman of JUI-F from NA-24 and Dawer Khan Kundi Of PTI from NA-25. Traditionally Dera politics has been dominated by Jamiat Ullema Islam because of the charismatic and dynamic personality of Maulana Mufti Mahmood. After his death his son Fazlur Rehman became the Chairman of JUI-F. The people of D I Khan feel let down by the two dominant parties PPP and JUI-F as they have not done any significant efforts to improve the quality of life, build the city infrastructure or create jobs. People want change in the status quo which has provided a room for new leadership to emerge under the banner of Pakistan Tehrike Insaf (PTI). PTI has quickly gained ground in the city as many notables including Faqeer Jamshed Ahmed, Abdul Quayyum Khan Kundi, Khalid Awan, Humayon Khan Gandapur has joined the party. The youthwing of PTI in the leadership of Irfan Mallick has established district level wings to reach out to the voters. It is expected that in the next elections PTI will emerge as a leading party in the city.

In some cases, the Scheldt delta is considered a separate delta to the Rhine-Meuse delta. The result is a multitude of islands, branches and branch names that may at first sight look bewildering, especially as a waterway that appears to be one continuous stream may change names as many as seven times, e.g. Rhine ‚Üí Bijlands Kanaal ‚Üí Pannerdens Kanaal ‚Üí Nederrijn ‚Üí Lek ‚Üí Nieuwe Maas ‚Üí Het Scheur ‚Üí Nieuwe Waterweg (‚Üí North Sea). Since the Rhine contributes most of the water, the shorter term Rhine Delta is commonly used. However, this name is also used for the delta where the Alpine Rhine flows into Lake Constance, so it is clearer to call the larger one Rhine‚ÄìMeuse delta, or even Rhine‚ÄìMeuse‚ÄìScheldt delta, as the Scheldt ends in the same delta. By some calculations, the delta covers , making it the largest in Europe. The economic importance of the Rhine‚ÄìMeuse‚ÄìScheldt delta is enormous, since the three rivers are important navigable waterways. The delta is the entrance from the North Sea to the vast German and Central European hinterland (and to a lesser extent France). Major ports in the delta are Rotterdam, Antwerp (Belgium), Vlissingen, Amsterdam (through the Amsterdam‚ÄìRhine Canal), and Ghent (through the Ghent‚ÄìTerneuzen Canal). The land areas in the delta are protected from flooding by the Dutch Delta Works. Geography thumb400pxrightSatellite image of the Northern part of the Rhine‚ÄìMeuse‚ÄìScheldt delta: 1\\\\.

The Brielse Meer (Lake Brielle, a former Rhine branch called Nieuwe Maas-Brielse Maas) v. The Haringvliet strait w. The Krammer strait x. Lake Grevelingen y. The North Sea. The shape of the Rhine delta is determined by two bifurcations: firstly, at Millingen aan de Rijn, the Rhine splits into the Waal and the Nederrijn, and secondly near Arnhem, the IJssel branches off from the Nederrijn. This creates three main flows, two of which change names rather often. The largest and southern main branch begins as the Waal and continues as the Boven Merwede (\\"Upper Merwede\\"), the Beneden Merwede (\\"Lower Merwede\\"), the Noord River (\\"North River\\"), the Nieuwe Maas (\\"New Meuse\\"), Het Scheur (\\"the Rip\\") and the Nieuwe Waterweg (\\"New Waterway\\"). The middle flow begins as the Nederrijn, then changes into the Lek, then joins the Noord, thereby forming the Nieuwe Maas. The northern flow keeps the name IJssel until it flows into Lake IJsselmeer. Three more flows carry significant amounts of water: the Nieuwe Merwede (\\"New Merwede\\"), which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from the Boven to the Beneden Merwede; the Oude Maas (\\"Old Meuse\\"), which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from the Benede Merwede into the Noord, and the Dordtsche Kil, which branches off from the Oude Maas. Changing the Meuse estuary in 1904: light blue old course, dark blue today's course Before the St. Elizabeth's flood (1421) the Meuse flowed just south of today's line Merwede‚ÄìOude Maas to the North Sea and formed an archipelago-like estuary with the Waal and the Lek. This system of numerous bays, estuary-like extended rivers, many islands and constant changes of the coastline, is hard to imagine today. From 1421 to 1904, the Meuse and the Waal merged further upstream at Gorinchem to form the Merwede. For flood protection reasons, the Meuse was separated from the Waal through a lock and diverted into a new outlet called the \\"Bergse Maas\\", then the Amer flowing into the former bay known as the Hollands Diep. The northwestern part of the estuary (around Hook of Holland), is still called Maasmond (\\"Meuse Mouth\\"), ignoring the fact that it now carries only water from the Rhine. This might explain the confusing naming of the various branches. The hydrography of the current delta is characterized by the delta's main arms, disconnected arms (Hollandse IJssel, Linge, Vecht, etc.) and smaller rivers and streams. Many rivers have been closed (\\"dammed\\") and now serve as drainage channels for the numerous polders. The construction of Delta Works changed the delta in the second half of the 20th century fundamentally. Currently Rhine water runs into the sea, or into former marine bays now separated from the sea, in five places, namely at the mouths of the Nieuwe Merwede, Nieuwe Waterway (Nieuwe Maas), Dordtse Kil, Spui and IJssel. The Rhine‚ÄìMeuse Delta is a tidal delta, shaped not only by the sedimentation of the rivers, but also by tidal currents. This meant that high tide formed a serious risk because strong tidal currents could tear huge areas of land into the sea. Before the construction of the Delta Works, tidal influence was palpable up to Nijmegen, and even today, after the regulatory action of the Delta Works, the tide acts far inland. At the Waal, for example, the most landward tidal influence can be detected between Brakel and Zaltbommel. History Already in the time of Julius Caesar, the \\"Island of the Batavi\\" was known to the Romans. Its eastern point was the split of the Rhine into the Oude Rijn and the Waal, which at this time were the two main branches of the Rhine. The Waal flowed into the Meuse in the Roman period. Pliny the Elder's Natural History gives a list of tribes living in the \\"Gaulish islands\\" within the delta region between different mouths of the Rhine. First he mentions the large island of the Batavians and the Cananefates. Then he gives the list of other peoples who he says are stretched out along 100 Roman miles, between the mouths Helinius and Flevus.Plin. Nat. 4.29 The Helinius (or Helinium) is understood to be the main mouth of the Meuse, where the main water of the southern branch of the Rhine, the Waal (Latin Vacalis) also discharged. Flevus (or Flevum) was a Roman fortification on the Ocean, north of the more important Old Rhine, mentioned by Tacitus, and equated today with Velsen.Tac. Ann. 4.72 Although the details are no longer clear, there was apparently sometimes an extension of the Old IJ that came close to the north sea here.Germania By Cornelius Tacitus, 4.72 But the term Flevo was also have used by Pomponius Mela to refer to the fresh water lakes which were in the area of the modern Zuiderzee, which Mela specifically says that the Rhine fed into. So the Rhine mouth mentioned by Pliny might have been a discharge into a lake, or perhaps water running to Flevum on the coast may have run via the lakes to the coast, perhaps first through an ancient version of the Vecht, or the IJssel. The IJssel however was joined to the Rhine artificially, by Drusus, and is quite far from any of the places known to be called Flevus. Suetonius says that this channel was still referred to as Drusus' fossa in his time.Suet. Cl. 1 Some authors have argued that the mouth Pliny mentions is the Vlie, much further to the north than Velsen where the main waters of the lake entered the North Sea.  Emissaries  There are actually five emissaries, namely; * Haringvlietdam (dam blocking the Haringvliet) * Nieuwe Waterweg (canal connecting Rotterdam to the North Sea) * North Sea Canal, connecting Amsterdam to IJmuiden * Afsluitdijk, damming off the Zuiderzee, with discharging sluices at two places (Stevinsluizen at Den Oever and Lorentzsluizen at Kornwerderzand).

It was built in 1699 by Rani Nathavati Ji (Solanki) who was the younger queen of the ruling Rao Raja Anirudh Singh of Bundi. It is a 46 m deep stepped well with some superb carvings on its pillars and a high arched gate. It is a multistoreyed structure with places of worship on each floor. The step well has a narrow entrance marked by four pillars. Stone elephant statues that face each other stand in the corners. Ogee brackets decorate all the archways of 46 m deep Raniji ki Baori, which is reputedly the largest Baori of Bundi. Baoris were significant social constructions in the medieval Bundi since they acted as assembly areas for the townsfolk. Raniji ki Baori has superb carvings on its pillars and a high arched gate. It was constructed during the reign of his son Maharao Raja Budh Singh who ruled Bundi from 1695 AD to 1729 AD.

Located in the Vemork power station, it was established in 1988 to allow the preservation of industrial society created by Norsk Hydro when they established themselves in Rjukan in 1907. The museum is an anchor point on the European Route of Industrial Heritage. Premise The research and exhibitions of the museum span the history of power-intensive industry in Norway after 1900; including hydroelectricity, electrochemical industry and the premise for the workers. In particular local heritage from Tinn and the Norwegian heavy water sabotage are given high priority. History The foundation running the museum was established on November 3, 1983 by the municipality, the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate and the labour unions Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions, Norwegian Workers Education Association, Norwegian Union of Chemical Industry Workers and EL & IT Forbundet. Later this was supplemented by the United Federation of Trade Unions, Statkraft and Statnett, but the latter two have since left. The museum moved into the Vemork power station, since Norsk Hydro had abandoned the hydrogen plant in 1971‚Äîand the first plant in the world to mass-produce heavy water. The first curator was hired in 1984, followed by two more employees in 1985. This phase of the establishing had a widespread goal, attempting to preserve both pre- and post-industrial heritage from Rjukan, including the establishment of Tinn Museum, a heritage village dedicated to the preindustrial society, in 1984. The permanent exhibition at Vemork was opened on June 20, 1988. In 2004 Tinn Museum was integrated into the Norwegian Industrial Workers Museum; which has the responsibilities for preserving local history from Tinn. This includes a digitalized collection of more than 30,000 photographs. The industry at Rjukan had its own railway, Rjukanbanen, that connected to the Tinnsj√∏ railway ferry. In 2004 the foundation running the heritage railway was discontinued, and in 2007 the Norwegian Industry Workers Museum was launched as the new operator by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage. This would allow the plants and Rjukan along with the railway, and equivalent closed plants at Odda to be nominated as a World Heritage Site by the directorate. In 2007 the Norwegian Ministry of Culture announced they would give NOK 8 million for the expansion of the museum.

It introduces the five main characters of the series and Miley Stewart's situation of living a secret double life as a teen pop star. The season also introduces several significant recurring characters such as Roxy Roker, Jake Ryan, and Rico Suave. The season's soundtrack was released on October 24, 2006 under the title Hannah Montana. The season itself was released on DVD as a four disc set on November 18, 2008, by Disney DVD. Certain individual episodes had been released earlier on other Hannah Montana DVDs. Production Hannah Montana debuted Friday, March 24, 2006 on Disney Channel with \\"Lilly, Do You Want to Know a Secret?\\" The first season completed its run on March 30, 2007 with \\"Bad Moose Rising\\". In the United Kingdom it first aired in the Summer period of 2006, then the first series aired on free-to-view channel FIVE showing all episodes, the second series then aired in 2009. The first season consists of 26 colored, full-screen, approx. 23-minute episodes (without ads) recorded using a multiple-camera setup. Filming began November 7, 2005, ended September 2006. Opening sequence The theme song for Hannah Montana is \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" written by Matthew Gerrard and Robbie Nevil, produced by Gerrard and performed by Miley Cyrus (as Miley Stewart and Hannah Montana). John Carta, who also composes the music cues to signify scene changes and commercial breaks, composed the music for the song. The song's lyrics describe the basic premise of the television series. The full-length version, which is 2 minutes, 54 seconds in length, was included on the show's soundtrack, released in October 2006. For the TV version of the theme, which lasts only 50 seconds, only the first two stanzas and the last two were used. \\"Just Like You\\" and \\"The Other Side of Me\\" were originally tested for the opening theme song, before \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" was chosen as the theme. Each cast member's name is \\"wiped\\" on the screen in a marquee-light-style, and episode clips of the cast members' character are shown as well.

He held the imperial rank of caesar between March 317 and September 324, while his father was augustus, and he was twice Roman consul. After losing a civil war, his father lost power and both he and Licinius the Younger were eventually put to death.  Family and background  Licinius I married Flavia Julia Constantia, daughter of the augustus Constantius Chlorus and half-sister of the augustus Constantine I. They wed at Mediolanum (Milan) in February 313. Three years later, Constantine attacked Licinius in the Cibalensean War. Constantine defeated Licinius at the Battle of Cibalae at Cibalae (Vinkovci) in Pannonia Secunda on the 8 October 316 and again at the Battle of Mardia near Hadrianopolis in Haemimontus (Edirne).  Life  aurei, marked: (\\"Our Lords Licinius, Pious Happy Augustus, and Licinius Caesar\\") Licinius II, son of Licinius, grandson of Constantius I, and half-nephew of Constantine, was born to Flavia Julia Constantia in July or August 315. While the augustus Licinius marched against Constantine in 316, Licinius II was left with his mother and the augustus's treasury at Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica). After Licinius was defeated by Constantine at the Battle of Cibalae, and lost two thirds of his army, he fled to Sirmium and thence to Singidunum (Belgrade), where he crossed the river Sava and destroyed the bridge to delay Constantine's pursuit of him. With this delay, Licinius and his family reached Hadrianopolis. After Constantine reached Philippopolis (Plovdiv), and after he and Licinius failed to come to terms over Licinius's appointment of Valerius Valens as co-augustus, the Battle of the Mardia (or \\"of Campus Ardiensis\\", probably Harmanli) ensued, in which Licinius was again defeated. Licinius failed to flee towards Byzantium (Istanbul) as expected, and outmanoeuvred Constantine by marching to Beroea (Veria) while Constantine continued to Byzantium. As a result, Licinius and Constantine made peace: excepting the dioecesis of Thrace, all the territory formerly administered by Licinius in the Balkans was ceded to Constantine's control. Constantine was to be recognized as senior augustus, and all Licinius and Constantine's sons were to be mutually recognized as caesares.Jupiter the Conservator of the Licinii, Augustus and Caesar\\")alt= = Caesar = On the 1 March 317 Licinius II was raised to the imperial rank of caesar by agreement between his father and Constantine. Constantine's sons Crispus and the infant Constantine II were elevated to caesar on the same day, at Serdica (Sofia). The date was chosen especially; it was the dies imperii (date of accession) of Constantine's father and Licinius's father-in-law Constantius I, the grandfather of all the new caesares. Crispus was no older than 17, while Constantine II was, at seven months, even younger than Licinius II, who was then only 20 months old. Sharing the same day of investiture, none of the caesares could claim seniority. Licinius II retained his title until 324, throughout the time his father remained in power. Licinius is said by Themistius to have been educated by the grammaticus, and later consul, Flavius Optatus. Licinius was mentioned in the inscription of a Roman milestone from Viennensis as . Licinius II was made consul in 319. His colleague was his uncle Constantine. In 321, the relationship between the two augusti had worsened and each made different nominations for the consulship: Licinius II was made consul for the second time with his father in the east, but Constantine and Crispus held the office in the west (see: list of Roman consuls). Licinius's quinquennalia was celebrated on the 1 March 321. The Munich Treasure was made for the occasion of the quinqennalia; besides a silver bust of Licinius I, three large silver bowls were made for largitio, each weighing a Roman pound ‚Äì . The largitio bowls were decorated with portraits of the two emperors, with inscriptions celebrating the quinquennalia of Licinius II as well as a vota (vow of good rulership) for a decennalia. After his defeats by Constantine and Crispus at the Battle of Chrysopolis and the Battle of the Hellespont (18 September 324), Licinius I surrendered himself and his remaining forces to Constantine at Nicomedia. At the intercession of Flavia Julia Constantia, Constantine spared his brother-in-law and nephew. Licinius the Elder retired to Thessalonica as a private citizen. Immediately after his father's defeat and capitulation the Licinius II was stripped of the title of caesar. Constantine seems to have regretted his leniency and the former augustus was hanged in the spring of 325.Grant, M.

(2009) Constantine: Unconquered Emperor, Christian Victor, Quercus, London, p. 182. The former augustus had been accused of plotting to renew hostilities and was executed on this pretext, real or imagined. Licinius's co-emperor and augustus Martinian was also executed, either at this time or in 324. Licinius II survived until the following year.Follis of Licinius II, 321‚Äì324 marked: (\\"Our Lord Valerius Licinianus Licinius, Noblest Caesar\\") on the obverse, with Jupiter on the reverse marked: (\\"Jupiter the conservator\\")  Death  The younger Licinius was executed by his uncle Constantine in 326. He fell victim to the augustus's suspicions and died at Pola, possibly in the context of the execution of Crispus. Like his father, Licinius II was the subject of a posthumous damnatio memoriae and their names were expunged from official inscriptions. = Liciniani filius in the Codex Theodosianus = A , is noted in two laws in the Codex Theodosianus dated 336. According to the Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, this was not Licinius II, but rather an illegitimate son legitimated by rescript. This son of the augustus was, by legislation, forced into slavery in the imperial textile factories (gynaeceum) in Carthage, Africa. The text contains a directive that he be reduced to the slave status of his birth. No son of Constantine's sister would have been referred to in this manner, therefore, this \\"son of Licinianus\\" must have been the illegitimate son of the emperor by a woman of servile status.

Nowadays, long-distance and regional traffic on the Nordbahn is routed at Hohen Neuendorf onto the Berlin Outer Ring to the Karower Kreuz and on to Berlin Main Station or Berlin-Lichtenberg. History Construction of the line was preceded by decades of planning from 1843 until 1870 when the newly founded Berlin Northern Railway Company (German: Berliner Nord- Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) gained the concessions from the states of Prussia and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. For financial reasons, the company was dissolved on 15 December 1875. The Prussian government acquired the unfinished railway and handed over further construction of it to the Lower Silesian-Markish Railway (Niederschlesisch-M√§rkische Eisenbahn). The opening took place in three stages: *10 July 1877: Berlin‚ÄìOranienburg‚ÄìNeustrelitz‚ÄìNeubrandenburg (134 km) *1 December 1877: Neubrandenburg‚ÄìDemmin (42 km) *1 January 1878: Demmin‚ÄìStralsund (47 km) The construction of the Northern Railway had a significant impact on the villages to the north of Berlin that were in the catchment area of the railway line. In some cases their population multiplied in the following decades. The term Nordbahn became part of place-names (for instance, Glienicke/Nordbahn) and newspapers used its name (Nordbahn- Nachrichten). L√∂wenberg station The Berlin terminus of the railway, but only for freight, was the first freight yard at Eberswalder Stra√üe, now the site of Mauerpark. Passenger services began at the original Nordbahnhof (North Station) in Pankow, today's Wollankstra√üe station, still evident in the design of the station and its forecourt. At the end of the 19th century the terminus of the railway or passenger trains for Berlin regional services was relocated to the Stettiner Bahnhof (Stettin‚Äînow Szczecin‚Äîstation), built on Invalidenstra√üe; the freight remained at Eberswalder Stra√üe. Up to 1912 separate suburban tracks were built next to the long distance tracks between Gesundbrunnen and Frohnau. At the same time the line was moved to an embankment, to eliminate level crossings. In 1926, the section from Frohnau to Borgsdorf was treated similarly. In 1925 the suburban services were electrified on the DC system on the section from Gesundbrunnen to Oranienburg. The route later became part of the Berlin S-Bahn. In 1950 the Stettiner Bahnhof was renamed the Nordbahnhof. Electrical operations continued until the building of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, when the line between Frohnau and Hohen Neuendorf was closed. The Berlin section of the Northern Railway had already been closed for mainline traffic to Nordbahnhof on 18 May 1952. Immediately after the wall was built, the S-Bahn between Oranienburg and Hohen Neuendorf became an isolated operation. Subsequently, S-Bahn tracks were built and electrified along the Berlin outer ring between Hohen Neuendorf and Blankenburg. This line was connected in November 1961 to the main S-Bahn network. In Berlin, S-Bahn services continued to Frohnau until the handover of operating rights of the S-Bahn in West Berlin from the East German Railways to the BVG on 9 January 1984. Services were first closed and only resumed on 1 October 1984. Rehabilitation carried out on the S-train tracks in 1985 placed them on a track profile that would make the restoration of the old main line for long distance traffic difficult. After the reunification, many of the smaller stops were however closed (D√ºsterf√∂rde (1996), Strelitz Alt (1995), Neddemin, Randow, Toitz-Rustow. In 1992, the gap between Frohnau and Hohen Neuendorf was reopened so that continuous S-Bahn services could resume on the Northern Railway to Oranienburg. In the long term, the recommissioning of the direct route from Berlin to Birkenwerder is planned. For this purpose, the long-distance railway tracks of the northern railway between the station Berlin-Gesundbrunnen and Birkenwerder on a length of 18.8 kilometres are to be rebuilt with two tracks with a line speed of 160 km/h, but no date has been set for this.

As a stop on the route des Indes, it was visited by sailors, diplomats and explorers. It was also popular with naturalists such as Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent. It was almost by accident that Charles Baudelaire stayed there for several weeks in 1841. Difficult to reach before the advent of commercial flight, it took a long time before being featuring on the tourist circuit. Travel was also difficult on the island itself. Before the R√©union railway was built in 1882, it took two days to cross the island from Saint-Denis to Saint- Pierre.Eric Boulogne, ¬´ Le petit train longtemps, √Æle de La R√©union ¬ª, Le si√®cle des petits trains, √©ditions Cenomane/La Vie du Rail & des Transports, 1992. Only intrepid hikers made the several-day expedition to see the active volcano Piton de la Fournaise. Creole families from the west explored the more accessible (but still wild) sites such as Bernica and the Saint-Gilles Ravine, as recorded in the poems of Leconte de Lisle.{langfrPerdu sur la montagne, entre deux parois hautes,/ Il est un lieu sauvage, au r√™ve hospitalier,/ Qui, d√®s le premier jour, n'a connu que peu d'h√¥tes ;}, ¬´Le Bernica ¬ª, 1862, in Po√®mes barbares. The painter Antoine Roussin published L'Album de l'√Æle as a series of installments in 1857. He was R√©unionese by adoption and these paintings gave an idea of the landscape and the most popular sites on the island during the second half of the 19th century. The rise of thermalism in the 19th century set off a some tourist activity among customers looking for relaxation. The spa clients stayed in the elegant Hell-Bourg station, and also in Cilaos after 1882. Access difficulties and the lack of infrastructure stopped a third location, Mafate-les-eaux, from exploiting its thermal potential in the same way. Until the first half of the 20th century, the economy depended on sugar cane. R√©union became a French department in 1946. = From becoming a department until the 1990s = Contact with mainland France increased, with the arrival of functionaries in R√©union, and many of the local populace moving to the mainland to search for work. By the end of World War II, flights operated between France and R√©union every three days. In 1963, R√©union received 3000 visitors, who stayed in its four tourist hotels. The first Boeing 707 left Gillot airport in 1967. Despite these changes, the island remained less popular with tourists than other destinations, and in particular received fewer tourists than the other overseas departments.Tourisme et d√©veloppement (Note d'Information n¬∞34, 01/04/1998) This was partly due to Air France's (and Air Madagascar's) monopoly of flights to the island. Other organisations started to get involved, including Club Med in the first half of the 1970s and Novotel in 1976. But it took the deregulation of air traffic (between 1983 and 1986) and the end of Air France's monopoly (allowing Union de Transports A√©riens¬´ Les DOM-COM : poussi√®res d'empire ou paradis touristiques ? ¬ª, Jean-Christophe Gay, geography professor at the University of Montpellier III, Alexandra Monot, 31 May 2005, disponible sur cafe.geo.net ) for tourism to start to develop spontaneously. The island gained a specific body for tourism in 1989. It was called the R√©union Tourism Committee (the CTR). Tourism truly developed during the 1990s and became one of the island's important economic resources.Le Tourisme √† La R√©union = 1990‚Äì2004: the big tourist boom = A large Air France plane landing on the runway of Roland-Garros airport built during the 1990s. Tourism started to develop beyond anything previously known in R√©union. A second airport, Pierrefonds near Saint-Pierre, opened to commercial traffic in 1998.Site of the Saint-Pierre Pierrefonds airport In January of that year the Observatoire du d√©veloppement de La R√©union noted that the general public were still sensitive to the development of the new sector, although it created many new jobs on the island.Journal de l'√éle de la R√©union, Monday 26 January 1998, {¬´ {langfrUn enjeu pour la population r√©unionnaise ? ¬ª} (\\"An issue for the Reunion population?\\"). Tourism brought 370,000 visitors to the Intense Island (as it had been named by the CTR), with a turnover of 1.7 million francs.Journal de l'√éle de la R√©union, Wednesday 17 June 1998, {langfr¬´ Un outil de r√©f√©rence ¬ª}(\\"A reference tool\\"). In 2000, the turnover from tourism overtook that of the local sugar industry. The authorities were confronted with new problems: land management, and the effect of tourism on local culture. Initiatives answering that question began to multiply, such as the start of villa holidays in the west of the island.Journal de l'√éle de la R√©union, Friday 14 January 2000, {langfr¬´ Tourisme : un toit pour les vacances ¬ª}(\\"Tourism: a roof for the holiday\\") In 2001, several communes elaborated on the concept of creole village, celebrating the diversity of R√©union heritage. Fifteen villages sought to highlight their individuality. For Bourg-Murat, this meant life at the door of the volcano; for Entre-Deux it was Creole huts and houses.Site on the concept of Creole villages The island started to publish a list of top-quality establishments in 1995 to rewarded the best providers of accommodation and catering.JIR, Tuesday 22 May 2001, ¬´ Saint-Denis : Remise de dipl√¥mes R√©union qualit√© tourisme ¬ª.

This was damaging natural sites in an unanticipated way.JIR, Saturday 20 September 2003, ¬´ Concilier d√©veloppement du tourisme et environnement ¬ª. But globally, the mood was optimistic and the island published a text Sch√©ma de d√©veloppement touristique de La R√©union in 2004. That year, they received 430,000 external tourists and generated 6,000 jobs in the sector, providing 6.5% of the total salary for all workers.Chiffres de l'Observatoire du D√©veloppement de la R√©union , JIR, Monday 5 April 2004, {langfr¬´ Le tourisme g√©n√®re plus de 6000 emplois salari√©s ¬ª}(\\"Tourism generates over 6000 employee salaries\\").JIR, Saturday 23 April 2005, ¬´ Office de tourisme intercommunal ¬ª : ¬´ [..] le bilan des actions men√©es par ses trois antennes √† Saint-Denis, Sainte-Marie et Sainte-Suzanne tout au long de 2004.

According to Insee figures, the decline got stronger and stronger.√âconomie de La R√©union, N¬∞ 123 ‚Äì 1st quarter of 2005 The crisis was global and affected the other French overseas departments too, but R√©union attributed it to a marketing failure.JIR, Tuesday 28 June 2005, ¬´ La R√©union s'exporte pour mieux importer les touristes ¬ª A series of mishaps contributed to a damaged image of R√©union as a destination. At the end of 2004, Air Bourbon went into liquidation, which left travellers on the island without a flight home. 7000 customers failed to get a refund for their tickets. In August 2005, Brigitte Bardot wrote to the head of R√©union to complain about the \\"dogs as shark bait\\" scandal, which had caused a media storm.See the Sunday 3 April 2005 edition of France 2, (\\"30 million friends\\") Also, the Chikungunya epidemic, which started at the end of 2005, reached a peak in January 2006. These all dissuaded people from visiting the island and receipts from tourism fell by 27% and employment declined in the hotel industry. Chikungunya : Un pr√©judice limit√©, sauf pour l'activit√© touristique - Insee The CTR blamed the drop in tourism on the epidemic,JIR, Wednesday 1 February 2006, \\"Le chik infeste la presse professionnelle du tourisme \\" (Chik infects the professional tourism press) in addition to the negative image that the island had suffered in the media.JIR, Wednesday 14 June 2006, ¬´ L'√Æle √† sensations victime de ses images n√©gatives ¬ª There had also been media exaggeration of the risk of shark attacks around the island, and of the risk of links to the Asian SARS outbreak. Believing the crisis to be cyclical, the CTR relaunched an information campaign, while the local tourism employers turned to the mainland for support. Three months later, barely 3 million of the expected 60 million had reached their intended recipients. Large groups with international stature, such as Bourbon and Accor, were excluded from state support due to European regulations. Small, local, businesses struggled to compile the right documentation. The Villepin government celebrated it as 4.5 million to relaunch tourism. A plan to relaunch R√©union as a destination was announced in September 2005. This campaign was launched from the City Hall steps in Paris, at the invitation of the mayor, Bertrand Delano√´. They hoped this would relaunch the destination with the mainlanders and R√©union expatriates, and seduce foreign tourists with the Creole village punch and samosas. The campaign was publicised by the written media, television and the internet. The CTR were assigned a budget of 800,000 Euros to publicise R√©union better in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. At the same time, the Prime Minister told the agency Odit France to compile a report analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of tourism in R√©union. At the end of 2006, the Journal de l'√Æle published an article claiming that the problems being discussed were in fact masking the underlying structural problems. = Improvements since 2014 onwards: European Tourism = In 2014, 405,700 foreign tourists visited the island.http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?reg_id=24&ref;_id=22542 Tourists coming from metropolitan France (Europe) were 78% of the total. That same year, the number of tourists from the rest of Europe also increased to an unprecedented 32,400 (a 49% increase). The jump is mainly explained by the increase in German visitors, Swiss and Belgian visitors accounting for 77% of tourists from the rest of Europe. For the first time, the number of German visitors exceeded the threshold of 10,000.  Tourist numbers  Tourism is a major contributor to R√©union's economy. In 2014, 405,700 foreign tourists visited the island. Despite this, the island does not experience mass tourism. The island has impressive natural features inland, but these natural tourist attractions are not well known. In order to boost its tourist industry, the authorities in R√©union heavily promote the country in France and at travel and tourism conferences throughout the world, and diversification of R√©union's tourist industry is a high priority. The tourist industry promotes the island's environment and encourages outdoor activities and ecotourism. R√©union's peak tourist season is from late June to early September, with another busy period from October to early January. In 2001, 424,000 tourists visited R√©union, creating a revenue of ‚Ç¨271.5 million. The number of tourists visiting R√©union decreased in 2004 because of the high cost of flights to the country and competition from the tourist attractions of Mauritius and Seychelles. The 2005 Chikungunya epidemic in R√©union was reported by the French media, which caused a loss of confidence among tourists. Tourist bookings decreased by more than 60% during 2006 and early 2007. One-third of the island's population was infected with the virus by 2007. Large efforts were made to kill the island's mosquito population, and the tourist industry began to recover. The island's status as an overseas department of France has benefited its infrastructure.  Tourist attractions  Waterfalls in R√©union R√©union's tourist attractions are not well known, and include its favourable climate and impressive scenery. The island's topography is very mountainous, with mountains that can be as high as 3,000 m (9,842 ft) close to the coast. The island has many natural tourist attractions, including Piton des Neiges (the highest point on the island), lava cliffs, and deep canyons. Another tourist attraction is the active shield volcano Piton de la Fournaise, one of the most active volcanoes in the world. The collapsed calderas of Cirque de Cilaos, Cirque de Mafate, and Cirque de Salazie also draw tourists. The Le Ma√Ødo viewpoint is located at an altitude of 2,205 m (7,232 ft) and has excellent views of the coast. There is good surfing off the island's west coast. R√©union's capital Saint-Denis and the lagoons of St-Gilles-les Bains also attract tourists. The Domaine du Grand Hazier, an 18th-century home of a sugar planter and official French historical monument, has a large garden with fruit trees and tropical flowers. Festivals take place year round throughout the island.

It is known for its wide selection of educational and enrichment centres and its pet shop (The Pet Safari), which was once the largest in Asia. The mall is owned by NTUC Income, and is managed by Frasers Property. History Eastpoint Mall was developed by Far East Organisation and was completed in December 1996. Like other suburban malls at that time, it had a Studio City cinema, an NTUC Fairprice supermarket, an Oriental Emporium department store, food court, a Funpolis arcade and Popular book store as anchors. It also had an array of speciality shops and restaurants. The mall pioneered several firsts, such as a rooftop children's pool and a wet market (The Pasar by FairPrice) on the ground level of the mall, although both were subsequently closed. In 1998, the property was sold to NTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Pte Ltd. In 1999, Studio Cinemas went bankrupt and was replaced by Golden Village. The wet market was replaced by local pet retailer The Pet Safari. Oriental Emporium moved out after filing for bankruptcy, and its space was taken up by Best Denki. The mall's popularity begin to decline in the early 2000s, as patronage declined due to competition from the larger malls at Tampines and the city. As a result, Golden Village closed in early 2002 and its premises was subsequently leased to a bunch of tuition and enrichment centres. In 2007, several anchor tenants, including The Pet Safari and Best Denki, withdrew or moved into smaller premises. Minor renovation works were also carried out as well. The mall did not undergo any major refurbishments until March 2013, when it was revamped with a new exterior facade, an increase in retail space and a refreshed tenant mix. Several anchor tenants were relocated to different levels, such as NTUC FairPrice taking up the entirety of Level 5, and Challenger and Daiso reallocated to Basement 1. The food court was reallocated to Level 4, Formerly operated by Food Junction. Level 6 remains allocated to educational centres, a child care centre and a nautical themed play deck. The mall reopened in December 2014. In 2019, Food Junction moved out, and its space was taken up by Courts and Malaysia Chiak.

Following the collapse of the Mali Federation, and due to French support for Senegal, Modibo Ke√Øta, the first President of Mali, sought closer ties with the Soviet Union. In 1961 the two countries signed trade and cultural pacts, and the Soviet Union granted Mali loans and other aid, which included the acquisition of two Ilyushin Il-18 passenger aircraft for Air Mali. Under the cultural agreement Russia sent circus performers, sports coaches and a soccer team to Mali. When Ke√Øta was overthrown by Moussa Traor√© by a coup d'√©tat in 1968, Traor√© improved relations with France and other Western countries, but Mali remained dependent on the Soviet Union for the arming and training of its military. Approximately 50 Soviet military advisors provided armour, artillery and parachute training to Mali's military, and trained all of Mali's pilots. The Soviets also improved the Malian Air Force base in Mopti, and occasionally used Malian airfields to stage supply flights for groups it supported in Angola.

(died 9 August 1600) was an English Roman Catholic priest. He is a Catholic martyr, beatified in 1987. Life Palasor was born at Ellerton-on-Swale, parish of Catterick, North Riding of Yorkshire. He arrived at Reims on 24 July 1592, and set out for the English College, Valladolid on 24 August 1592. There, he was ordained priest in 1596. He was arrested in the house of John Norton, of Ravenswroth, nearly Lamesley, County Durham. Norton seems to have been the second son of Richard Norton, of Norton Conyers, attainted for his share in the Rising of the North in 1569. Norton and his wife (if the identification is correct, she was his second wife, Margaret, daughter of Christopher Redshaw of Owston) were arrested at the same time, with a noble English gentleman, the Blessed John Talbot, one of the Talbots of Thornton-le-Street, North Riding of Yorkshire. All four were tried at Durham and condemned to death, Palasor for being a priest, and the others for assisting him. Another gentleman was condemned at the same time but saved his life by conforming to the Church of England, as the others might have done. Mrs. Norton, being supposed to be with child, was reprieved. The others were executed together. Richard Challoner tells how an attempt to poison Palasor and his companions made by the jailer's wife resulted in the conversion of her maid-servant Mary Day.

The field that studies the process, rates, incidence, effects, and prevalence of victimisation is called victimology. Peer victimisation Peer victimisation is the experience among children of being a target of the aggressive behaviour of other children, who are not siblings and not necessarily age-mates. Secondary victimizationPrevalence= Secondary victimization (also known as post crime victimization \\"post-crime victimization or secondary victimization\\". Comprehensive Criminal Justice Terminology. Prentice Hall. Archived from the original on 10 March 2013. Retrieved 9 January 2008. or double victimization Doerner, William (2012). Victimology. Burlington, MA: Elseiver, Inc. .) refers to further victim- blaming from criminal justice authorities following a report of an original victimization. Rates of victimization are high, with an estimated 5.7 million individuals experiencing at least one victimization in 2016.Bureau of Justice Statistics. (2016). Criminal victimization. U.S. Department of Justice. Considering these are cases of criminal offenses, the reported rates of violent victimization are disproportionately low. Less than half (42%) report any violent crime of threatened or real force, such as physical assault, battery, or weapons offenses. Additionally, under a quarter (23%) report rape, childhood, or sexual assault to the police. Further, out of the portion that does report sexual assault or rape, about half describe the experience as upsetting, frustrating, and useless. Despite efforts to increase criminal reports of victimization, authorities and law enforcement personnel often discount individuals‚Äô violent experiences and fail to attend to both the necessary legal actions and interpersonal actions. =Vulnerability= When institutions or criminal justice system personnel fail to support the victimized individual, victims are vulnerable to secondary victimization. While the appropriate and legal way to respond to primary victimization is to report the event, authorities often deny, do not believe, or blame the victim (Campbell & Raja, 1999; Campbell & Raja, 2005). In turn, up to 90% of victims report experiencing negative social reaction and attribute the incident as a ‚Äúsecond rape‚Äù or ‚Äúsecond assault‚Äù. Research suggests that victim of sexual violence or assault are the least likely to receive support or resources following reporting. This may be due to perceived lack of evidence, social stigma, and overall discomfort when dealing with sexual incidences. In a study of rape victims undergoing prosecution for their assault, those who felt their detectives responded empathetically and with understanding were likelier to pursue prosecution, felt their experiences were important, and their cases deserved to be heard. Empathetic and supportive responses from authorities could potentially improve mental and physical health in rape survivors and additionally, improve reporting rates and lessen judgmental attitudes from the criminal justice system. Because sexual violence is a sensitive subject for all parties, criminal justice personnel may avoid, ignore, or publicly misconstrue their opinions about the situation as an effort to separate themselves or cope with dangerous and uncomfortable situations. Studies suggest these misconceptions by the system may further damage individuals‚Äô mental health and a safer world. This could be combatted with accepting, non- accusatory perspectives, aiding in accuracy the sexual violence reports. Several authors speculate authorities‚Äô supportive approach benefits the victim and promotes a just world. In this way, previous victims might report and seek appropriate resources in the future. Those exposed to traumatic victimization are vulnerable to experiencing secondary victimization. If social needs such as empathy, support, and understanding are not met, individuals are prone to this phenomenon. While anybody who has experienced victimization is susceptible to secondary victimization, prevalence rates are significantly elevated for some populations. This includes females, children, racial and sexual minorities, and those sexually assaulted by an acquaintance or stranger. Moreover, those experiencing a certain type of violence are at increased likelihood to experience secondary victimization. These include physical assault, sexual assault, and domestic violence Notably, rape victims are at highest risk of secondary victimization from the criminal justice system, with about half who report describing the process as distressing.Ullman, S. E. (2010). Psychology of women (APA Division 35). Talking about sexual assault: Society's response to survivors. Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association. =Reporting victimization= As a consequence of social rejections and insensitivities to acknowledging trauma or violence, individuals are increasingly apt to continue not reporting. This can be detrimental to victims‚Äô mental health, as sexual violence often happens more than once and not reporting violence helps to maintain a repeated cycle of abuse. Experiencing violence is associated with negative mental and physical outcomes, including shame, emotion dysregulation, psychological stress, loss of resources, and mental health pathology. In a meta-analysis about sexual assault victimization and psychopathology, there was a medium- sized effect overall effect size was moderate after accounting for several mental health diagnoses including depression, anxiety, suicidality, disordered eating, and substance abuse. This indicates that sexual assault victimization is significantly related to mental health distress even after controlling for other associated symptoms. Additionally, women who experience secondary victimization are likelier to have both adverse physical health and mental health implications and are also unlikely to seek services and treatment. Given these individuals are likely in a troubled state, pressures of reporting are cognitively taxing. To report crime, especially sexual crimes, implicates a further level of vulnerability. When victims are met with hostile reactions, they are reinforced to not report. This is not only harmful to the individual, but to society, in that perpetrators are thus permitted to continue committing crimes and abuse. As a consequence of victim-blaming and other negative attitudes towards victims, reported rates of criminal abuse are low and distress in victims is high. =Interactions with the criminal justice system= Despite high rates of secondary victimization, reporting rates are low. It is not unusual for criminal justice personnel to discourage victims from prosecuting their sexual assault cases due to victim-blaming behaviors and discounting victims‚Äô traumatic experiences.Ullman, S. E. (2010). Psychology of women (APA Division 35). Talking about sexual assault: Society's response to survivors. Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association. doi 10.1037/12083-000 One incident that attracts much controversy in the criminal justice system is reporting violent crimes on one‚Äôs intimate partner. Women who report rape by an intimate partner are seen as less credible by the system and law enforcement are more likely to encourage dropping the case. Societal standards of obeying an intimate partner and thus encompassing rape culture are prevalent in the criminal justice system. Although it is a legal crime that is being reported, victims are often turned away feeling alienated, hopeless, and unworthy and have limited options for resources beyond the system. =Fragmented memory= A possible explanation of why the criminal justice system is unlikely to believe many victims is due to victims‚Äô fragmented memory. It is not uncommon for victims of sexual abuse to also have a traumatic brain injury or other neurobiological reactions due to assault.Campbell, R. (2012). The neurobiology of sexual assault: Implications for first responders in law enforcement, prosecution, and victim advocacy. NIJ Research for the Real World Seminar. Retrieved from http://nij.gov/multimedia/presenter/presenter-campbell/Pages/welcome.aspx. In her work, Campbell explains how molecular changes occur in response to trauma, and how this can influence discrepancies in victims‚Äô reports and recollections of the event. After a traumatic incident, chemical alterations in the brain change, impacting encoding and processing the memory Not only do neurobiological changes affect victims‚Äô memories, but emotion dysregulation, repression, suppression, dissociation, and avoidance of the event are also common reactions in victims These cognitive and neurobiological factors are rarely considered when a victim reports an assault. During the time law enforcement personnel gather information about the event, they could be met with victims explaining their stories inconsistently due to a fragmented memory. Either by a neurobiological change or psychological response to particularly distressing trauma, victims may fall prey to the inability to coherently portray details of the event, thus taking away credibility and facilitating secondary victimization. Revictimisation The term revictimisation refers to a pattern wherein the victim of abuse and/or crime has a statistically higher tendency to be victimised again, either shortly thereafter or much later in adulthood in the case of abuse as a child. This latter pattern is particularly notable in cases of sexual abuse. While an exact percentage is almost impossible to obtain, samples from many studies suggest the rate of revictimisation for people with histories of sexual abuse is very high. The vulnerability to victimisation experienced as an adult is also not limited to sexual assault, and may include physical abuse as well. Reasons as to why revictimisation occurs vary by event type, and some mechanisms are unknown. Revictimisation in the short term is often the result of risk factors that were already present, which were not changed or mitigated after the first victimisation; sometimes the victim cannot control these factors. Examples of these risk factors include living or working in dangerous areas, chaotic familial relations, having an aggressive temperament, drug or alcohol usage and unemployment. Revictimisation may be \\"facilitated, tolerated, and even produced by particular institutional contexts, illustrating how the risk of revictimization is not a characteristic of the individual, nor is it destiny.\\" Revictimisation of adults who were previously sexually abused as children is more complex. Multiple theories exist as to how this functions. Some scientists propose a maladaptive form of learning; the initial abuse teaches inappropriate beliefs and behaviours that persist into adulthood. The victim believes that abusive behaviour is \\"normal\\" and comes to expect, or feel they deserve it from others in the context of relationships, and thus may unconsciously seek out abusive partners or cling to abusive relationships. Another theory draws on the principle of learned helplessness. As children, they are put in situations that they have little to no hope of escaping, especially when the abuse comes from a caregiver. One theory goes that this state of being unable to fight back or flee the danger leaves the last primitive option: freeze, an offshoot of death-feigning.  Offenders choosing pre-traumatized victims  In adulthood, the freeze response can remain, and some professionals have noted that victimisers sometimes seem to pick up subtle clues of this when choosing a victim. This behaviour can make the victim an easier target, as they sometimes make less effort to fight back or vocalise. Afterwards, they often make excuses and minimise what happened to them, sometimes never reporting the assault to the authorities. Self- victimisation Self-victimisation (or victim playing) is the fabrication of victimhood for a variety of reasons such to justify abuse of others, to manipulate others, a coping strategy or attention seeking. Self-image of victimisation (victim mentality) Victims of abuse and manipulation sometimes get trapped into a self-image of victimisation. The psychological profile of victimisation includes a pervasive sense of helplessness, passivity, loss of control, pessimism, negative thinking, strong feelings of guilt, shame, self- blame and depression. This way of thinking can lead to hopelessness and despair.Braiker, Harriet B., Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation (2006) Rates of victimisation in United States Levels of criminal activity are measured through three major data sources: the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), self-report surveys of criminal offenders, and the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). However, the UCR and self- report surveys generally report details regarding the offender and the criminal offense; information on the victim is only included so far as his/her relationship to the offender, and perhaps a superficial overview of his/her injuries. The NCVS is a tool used to measure the existence of actual, rather than only those reported, crimes‚Äîthe victimisation rate‚Äîby asking individuals about incidents in which they may have been victimised. The National Crime Victimization Survey is the United States' primary source of information on crime victimisation. Each year, data is obtained from a nationally represented sample of 77,200 households comprising nearly 134,000 persons on the frequency, characteristics and consequences of criminal victimisation in the United States. This survey enables the (government) to estimate the likelihood of victimisation by Rape (more valid estimates were calculated after the surveys redesign in 1992 that better tapped instances of sexual assault, particularly of Date rape), robbery, assault, theft, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft for the population as a whole as well as for segments of the population such as women, the elderly, members of various racial groups, city dwellers, or other groups. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), the NCVS reveals that, from 1994 to 2005, violent crime rates have declined, reaching the lowest levels ever recorded. Property crimes continue to decline. In 2010, the National Institute of Justice reported that American adolescents were the age group most likely to be victims of violent crime, while American men were more likely than American women to be victims of violent crime, and blacks were more likely than Americans of other races to be victims of violent crime.

The Starlight Express: cover from 1916  Production  On 9 November 1915, Sir Edward Elgar was invited by Robin Legge, music critic of The Daily Telegraph, to write the music for a children's fantasy play to be produced at the Kingsway Theatre that Christmas. The play was The Starlight Express, an adaptation of a novel by Algernon Blackwood called A Prisoner in Fairyland, by Blackwood and Violet Pearn. The baritone and composer Clive Carey had already started his own setting, but abandoned it when Elgar was commissioned.MusicWeb International The producer was to be Basil Dean: but since he had been called up for army service in France, he was replaced by the actress Lena Ashwell.Stage Beauty: Lena Ashwell (1872‚Äì1957) Elgar was soon shown the script by Ashwell and had successful meetings with her and with Blackwood. The story appealed to Elgar because of its similarities to the private fantasy world of his own childhood which he had depicted in the music he wrote for \\"The Wand of Youth\\"; his first thought was to re-use that music, and he wove many reminiscences of it into the score. He worked on it enthusiastically, and in just over a month had produced over 300 pages of score ‚Äì songs and incidental music ‚Äì in time for the rehearsals. On 6 December the two chosen singers, the Australian-born soprano Clytie Hine and baritone Charles Mott,Elgar's Baritone by Charles A. Hooey ‚Äì Charles Mott rehearsed with Elgar. The Starlight Express was produced by Lena Ashwell at the Kingsway Theatre in London, as one of her high-quality wartime entertainments. The production was announced in The Times, mentioning that the small orchestra pit of the theatre would be enlarged to accommodate a full orchestra.The Times, 30 November 1915 It opened on 29 December 1915. The premiere was to have been the conducted by the composer, but because Lady Elgar had suffered concussion a few days before as the result of a traffic accident, he stayed at home with her, and the conductor was the young Julius Harrison.Julius Harrison (1885‚Äì1863), composer and conductor Philip Scowcroft on Julius Harrison It ran for only one month, closing on 29 January 1916. The reasons for the failure were inappropriate design of the characters and scenery by Henry Wilson (who had been chosen and his work approved by Lena Ashwell), and the difficulty Pearn had in making something theatrical with her adaptation of the book. Both Blackwood and Elgar had expressed misgivings about the design, and Blackwood had considered using his right to object and get a new artist. Blackwood objected to \\"this murder of my simple little Play ... Arts & Crafts pretentious rubbish stitched onto your music by a silly crank who has never read the play\\". Elgar agreed. This would have meant postponement of the opening. The critics who reported their view of the opening night, while praising the music and particular performers, remarked on the lack of substance to the story. The music did not deserve to be forgotten. Elgar negotiated with The Gramophone Company, and on 18 February 1916, the music was recorded on eight sides, with the songs performed by Agnes Nicholls and Charles Mott. Later that year the three Organ Grinder's Songs were published by Elkin, with a piano accompaniment arranged by Julius Harrison.

The Song (first at the words \\"eyes; Let me sleep a moment\\") includes self-quotations of \\"The Little Bells\\" music from \\"The Wand of Youth\\". ;Song 1\\\\. The Organ Grinder: \\"To the Children\\" O children, open your arms to me, Let your hair fall over my eyes; Let me sleep a moment ‚Äì and then awake In your garden of sweet surprise ! For the grown up folk are a wearisome folk, And they laugh all my fancies to scorn, The grown up folk are a wearisome folk, And they laugh all my fancies to scorn, They laugh all my fancies to scorn. O children, open your hearts to me, And tell me your wonder thoughts, Who lives in the palace inside your brain? Who plays in its outer courts? Who hides in the hours To-morrow holds? Who sleeps in your Yesterdays? Who tip-toes along past the curtained folds Of the shadow that Twilight lays? O children, open your eyes to me, And tell me your visions too. Who squeezes the sponge when the salt tears flow To dim their magical blue? Who brushes the fringe of their lace-veined lids? Who trims their innocent light? Who draws up the blinds when the sun peeps in? Who fastens them down at night? O children, I pray you speak low to me, And cover my eyes with your hands. O kiss me again till I sleep and dream That I'm lost in your fairy-lands; That I'm lost in your fairy-lands; For the grown-up folk are a troublesome folk, And the book of their childhood is torn! Is blotted, and crumpled, and torn! The music continues through the curtain rise on the first scene Scene 1 The curtain rises on a family living in a pension in the mountains of Switzerland, showing grown-ups with problems which are first expressed unaccompanied by music: there is Daddy (an unsuccessful author), Mother (with domestic problems), the pension manager Widow Jequier with residents that do not pay, old Miss Waghorn always searching for her long-lost brother, and Cousin Henry. The children identify with star constellations: Jane Anne the Pleiades, Jimbo the Pole Star, and Monkey with the Great and Little Bear. Cousin Henry is Orion. The children are concerned that the adults who have become 'wumbled' (worried/muddled) need 'sympathy' in the form of star-dust. There is incidental music but there are no songs in this act, which has only one scene. =Act II= Before the curtain opens, there is a short musical prelude, and the Organ Grinder sings the waltz-song \\"The Blue-Eyes Fairy\\". ;Song 2\\\\. The Organ Grinder: \\"The Blue-Eyes Fairy\\" There's a fairy that hides in the beautiful eyes Of the children who treat her well; In the little round hole where the eyeball lies She weaves her magical Spell. She is awfully tiny and shy to the sight, But her magic's past believing, For she fills you with light and with laughter, It's the spell of her own sweet weaving. But! the eyes must be blue, And the heart must be true, And the child must be better than gold! And then if you'll let her, The quicker the better She'll make you forget that you're old. So, if such a child you should chance to see, Or with such a child to play, No matter how tired or dull you be, Nor how many tons you weigh You will suddenly find that you're young again, And your movements light and airy And you'll try to be solemn and stiff in vain- It's the spell of the Blue-Eyes Fairy. The scene is concluded by an Entr‚Äôacte \\"In the Forest\\". Scene 1 ;Scene 1 ‚Äì Part 1 The curtain rises during the Entr‚Äôacte music. Cousin Henry, Monkey and Jimbo are outside the Star-Cave at the edge of a pine-forest. The cave is too narrow for them to enter. They fall asleep. The Sprites appear and Night falls. The Organ-Grinder sings the Curfew Song. The Sprites hide. ;Song 3\\\\. The Organ Grinder: \\"The Curfew Song\\" The sun has gone; The tide of stars is setting all our way, The Pleiades call softly to Orion, As nightly they have called these million years; The children lie asleep; now let them out, And, over-hearing, We waft the fairy call into your dreams, That you may swim upon that tide of gold And list'ning in your hearts, Just over-hear That deep tremendous thunder Signalling reply: All's well! Orion answering the Pleiades! There is the Dance of the Pleiades as the curtain falls. ;Scene 1 ‚Äì Part 2 The curtain rises. It is now night-time and the children are awake. The introduction includes a violin and harp duet, and the \\"Little Bells\\" music from \\"The Wand of Youth\\". The Sprites descend from the Starlight Express: they are the Organ Grinder, the Sweep who sweeps worries away, the Dustman with the stardust of sympathy, the Lamplighter who lights up hope (and the stars), the Head Gardener who makes things grow, the Tramp with instinctive simplicity, and the 'Laugher' who sings troubles into joy. The Woman-of-the-Haystack is the mother of them all, borne on the winds. ;Song 4\\\\. The Laugher: \\"I'm everywhere\\" (laughs) I'm everywhere, The universal solvent of despair, (laughs) Ah! that sings away the half Of ev'ry care because I laugh! I laugh ;Song 5\\\\. The Organ Grinder: \\"Come Little Winds\\" Wake up, you little Night Winds : Blow your best ! We want you all - Ha-ha! that's East and West, The North Wind too, She always blows the strongest: You all must draw your deepest breath and longest, With open mouth! Now go and blow the Haystack out of bed! Whistle her dreams of straw across the sky And whirl her canvas skirts about her head - You can but try! Go, sweep her to'ards the Cave, and break her trance: Thick Mother of the Sprites - She must get in: Even a Haystack's elephantine dance Is somewhere thin! Is somewhere thin! ;Interlude The \\"Sun Dance\\" and \\"Moths and Butterflies\\" music from the \\"Wand of Youth\\" Scene 2 ;Prelude The prelude includes a quotation from the \\"Fairy Pipers\\" of \\"The Wand of Youth\\". The Sprites enter the cave and scatter stardust on the sleeping villagers. The Dustman scatters the finest dust on the ancient Miss Waghorn, who rests from the search for her brother. The Lamplighter exits to tend \\"the fires that are going out round the world.\\" Scene 3 The Introduction while the curtain rises includes \\"Moths and Butterflies\\" from \\"The Wand of Youth\\". ;Song 6\\\\. The Laugher: \\"Tears and Laughter\\" Oh! stars shine brightly! He's sleeping tightly ! His pattern's pouring through! Oh! Sprites come swiftly! Unwumble deftly! The world has need of you! They'll listen to my song And understand That, exiled over long, From Fairyland, The weary world has rather lost its way! Rather lost its way! My secret's double, For tears of trouble Are really tears of laughter gone astray. ;Song 7\\\\. Soprano (Jane Anne's song): \\"Dawn Song\\" We shall meet the morning spiders, The fairy cotton riders, Each mounted, each mounted on a star's reflected ray. With their tiny nets of feather. They collect our thoughts together, And on strips of windy weather bring the Day, And on strips of windy weather bring the Day! The curtain falls at the end of the scene. =Act III= After a short prelude which includes part of the \\"March\\" from \\"The Wand of Youth\\", The Organ Grinder sings \\"My Old Tunes\\". ;Song 8\\\\. The Organ Grinder: \\"My Old Tunes\\" My old tunes are rather broken And they come from far away, Bring just a little token Of a long-forgotten day; When the children came to listen, T'other side the garden fence, And my heart leapt out of prison At the gift ‚Äì of seven pence! Just beyond the Haystack's shadow, Long ago, that leafy June, How they danced about the meadow At the rising of the moon! While from out a railway carriage, Standing ready and alight, Stepped their guests as to a marriage - Asked to dine ‚Äì and stay the night! Sweep and Laugher danced together, And a man who had a lamp Capered lightly as a feather With a lazy-looking Tramp; When a Voice disturbed the Lancers: \\"Children, come, it's time for bed\\" Railway carriage, Sprites and Dancers Flew up to the stars instead! Now I am a Constellation, Free from ev'ry earthly care, Playing nightly at my station For the Big and Little Bear. But my tunes are still entrancing As that night in leafy June, When I caught the children dancing With the Sprites beneath the moon! Still the children come to hear me In the lane or dingy street; Still the heavy pavement near me Flutters to their happy feet; For my tunes are ne'er forgotten, And they bring the scent of musk: Grown-up folk may call 'em rotten, But I'm looked for when it's dusk! Scene 1 The curtain rises on Jane Anne. ;Song 9\\\\. Jane Anne: \\"Dandelions, daffodils\\" Dandelions, daffodils, Sheets of yaller roses, Goldenrods and Marigolds, Buttercups for posies! The curtain closes for the Entr‚Äôacte which is the \\"Blue-Eyes Fairy\\" Waltz, and this is followed by the \\"Dance of the Pleiades\\". Scene 2 The final scene is the Pine forest by night, before the Star Cave. Madame Jequier rejoices because Cousin Henry has secretly paid all the debts of her pension. Daddy enters, speaking through the \\"Starlight\\" music: ;Song 10\\\\. The Laugher: \\"Laugh a little ev'ry day\\" Laugh a little ev'ry day At yourself, that is to say. Plan it, seed it. Millions want it. Hark! Their dreams Have split the seams. ;Song 11\\\\. Organ Grinder: \\"The Dawn\\" They're all soft-shiny now The time draws near; Their hearts are dusted And the path's swept clear! The tide of stars is setting all one way, Bring on the dawn ‚Äì yet not the dawn of day! Incidental music, including the \\"Dance of the Pleides\\" and \\"Fairy Pipers\\" from \\"The Wand of Youth\\". ;Song 12\\\\. Jane Anne: \\"Oh, think Beauty\\" Oh, think Beauty, It's your duty. Ev'ry loving gentle thought Of this fairy brilliance wrought. While the busy Pleiades, Sisters to the Hyades, Seven by seven, Across the Heaven. =Finale= The stone is rolled away from the Star-cave. The scene is brightened by the entrance of the Sprites, and the humans enter. The ghost of Miss Waghorn enters 'clothed in light'. ;Song 13\\\\.

Elgar, writing to a friend, said \\"It is difficult to believe that Charles Mott is dead; dead of wounds in France. I am overwhelmed: a simple, honest GOOD soul.\\" *In 1933 the conductor Joseph Lewis constructed from the score a 40-minute selection from The Starlight Express which he conducted in several BBC radio broadcasts. But his score and other valuable BBC material was destroyed in an air-raid in 1940. *In September 1940 the Kingsway Theatre was damaged by fire in an air raid. All The Starlight Express stage props and music (conductor's score and orchestra parts) was destroyed. However, Elgar had left his manuscript full score of the music with the publishers, Messrs Elkin & Co., and apart from memories and reviews, this became the only surviving remnant. Fortunately this score also contained many of his own written notes on the performance. The score is signed \\"Edward Elgar, Finis, A.E. December 1915\\" ‚Äì A. E. was his wife's initials, and Elgar, typically doubled the pun with the inscription \\"AE 15\\" (abbreviated Latin \\"AETATIS 15\\", English \\"Age 15\\"): he was a child again! *In 1984 Richard Adams provided a 'performing narrative' to accompany a performance of Elgar's score in the Netherlands. The narrator for the occasion was composer Michael Berkeley. Recordings *On 18‚Äì19 February 1916, a selection of the songs and music were given an acoustic recording at the HMV Studios, Hayes, by The Gramophone Company. The singers were Charles Mott and Agnes Nicholls, and Elgar conducted the \\"Symphony Orchestra\\". There were four 12-inch records (D455-8): (1) To the Children and The Blue-Eyes Fairy (Mott); (2) My Old Tunes and Curfew Song (Mott); (3) Come Little Winds (Mott), Wind Dance (orchestra), Tears and Laughter and Sunrise Song (Nicholls); (4) The Laugher's Song (Nicholls) and Finale ‚Äì Hearts must be soft-shiny dressed (Nicholls and Mott).Kennedy, p.320 *In December 1935, four of the songs were recorded at the HMV Studios, Hayes, by The Gramophone Company. The singers were Stuart Robertson and his wife Alice Moxon. It is not known who conducted the orchestra. The songs were To the Children, The Laugher's Song, The Blue- Eyes Fairy and My Old Tunes. *On 26 September 1946, two of the Organ Grinder's songs (My old tunes and To the Children) were recorded at Decca Studios in London. The singer was Henry Cummings, with an orchestra conducted by Charles Groves (in his first recording session). *In 1964 EMI/HMV released The Miniature Elgar inspired by the BBC-TV Monitor film. It included the songs My old Tunes and To the Children, performed by Frederick Harvey with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Lawrance Collingwood. *In 1973, Chandos Records recorded some of the songs, performed by John Lawrenson and Cynthia Glover, with Michael Austin (organ) and the Bournemouth Sinfonietta conducted by George Hurst. The songs were To the Children, The Blue-Eyes Fairy, The Laugher's Song, Tears and Laughter, The Dawn Song, My Old Tunes, Jane Anne's song and Finale. *In 1974‚Äì1975, a complete recording was made by EMI/HMV on 28/29 November 1974, 20/22 December 1974 and 22 October 1975.

Distinctive aspects The Didsbury Mosque and Manchester Islamic Centre says that it \\"represents a wide range of the Muslim community of various origins and/or Islamic schools of thought\\". The mosque holds open-days with displays, talks, question-and-answer sessions, and guided tours. The mosque has a Sharia (Islamic law) Department which issues fatwas (Islamic decrees), oversees family affairs, helps calculate zakat (a type of alms-giving), and provides advice and mediation with regard to financial transactions. With radio coverage of most of South Manchester, the mosque broadcasts adhan (Islamic call to prayer), prayers themselves, Friday sermons, and daily reminders, as well as talks and lectures given in the prayer hall of the mosque. The Manchester Islamic Centre is registered as a charity with the Charity Commission. Attendees There are strong Libyan ties within the mosque, with various people from the mosque having been involved, in Libya, in the civil war. In 2011, the (current) mosque imam travelled to Libya, where he aided moderate rebel groups to help topple Gaddafi. Another person from the mosque was described variously as a \\"member\\" and a \\"senior member\\" of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. A regular worshipper at the mosque, Abd al-Baset Azzouz, al Qaeda operative left Britain in 2009 to join the terror group‚Äôs leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Pakistan, before heading to Libya to run an al Qaeda network in the east of the country.https://news.vice.com/story/the- manchester-bomber-grew-up-in-a-neighborhood-struggling-with-extremism At least two British recruits of Islamic State also worshipped at the mosque. In December 2017, mosque attendee Mohammed Abdallah, was jailed for 10 years for being a member of Islamic State, where he was listed as a \\"specialist sniper\\".  Manchester attack and response  The perpetrator of the Manchester Arena bombing was identified as Salman Ramadan Abedi, an attendant of the mosque. His father, Ramadan Abedi (also known as Abu Ismael), called the adhan at the mosque, and his older brother, Ismail Abedi, was a tutor in the mosque's Qur'an school. Both men were arrested. The mosque released a statement condemning the terror attack. The mosque also held a moment of silence to remember the victims of the bombing. Muslims opposed to militant Islamic ideologies, cited by the Voice of America, have said that the mosque must bear some responsibility for Abedi's radicalisation because of the conservative Salafi brand of Islam it allegedly espouses. Rashad Ali, senior fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue and counter-terror expert, told Vice News the mosque preached a \\"fairly radical, puritan\\" brand of Salafist Islam and was \\"effectively taken over at certain points by various Libyan militia groups, including ones associated with the Muslim Brotherhood.\\" He said the Abedi family subscribed to a radical political strain of Salafism ‚Äì a background which suggested the bomber would have had a shorter pathway to radicalisation than others. One attendee said in 2017 that allegedly, \\"every other Friday khutba [sermon] at Didsbury was about how bad ISIS are\\" and that the bomber allegedly, \\"hated the mosque.\\", whereas another attendee said Salman Abedi \\"learned the Qur‚Äôan by heart\\" at the mosque.

The design was created by Robert Garbe. It was intended as a successor to the Prussian P 6, which was regarded as unsatisfactory.  Construction  P8 driver's cabBecause Garbe was an advocate of the simplest possible designs, a straightforward, superheated steam, two-cylinder driving gear was envisaged. The P 8 benefited especially from superheated steam technology, which had just been developed by Wilhelm Schmidt (nicknamed 'hot steam Schmidt'), that led to outstanding performance for those times. The P 8 was a very economical locomotive that did not make great demands on the ability of the engine driver. At the outset Garbe even designed the P 8 as an express train locomotive, with the expectation of attaining a top speed of . As a result, the first units were fitted with low-wind-resistance, tapered driver's cabs. The enthusiasm of crews for the new locomotive was at first muted. The boiler was very effective at evaporation (there was already evidence of a combustion chamber at the front end of the firebox), however against that there were numerous teething troubles, e.g. the driving rod bearings were too small. This led continually to overheating. The loosely coupled Prussian box tender led to disturbing riding qualities when running tender-first. Its riding performance was never fully satisfactory. As a result of poor weight compensation, the top speed estimated by Garbe was never achieved and it was eventually assessed at 100 km/h (60 mph). One characteristic feature of the P 8 is the large distance between the centre and rear coupled axles. At the outset the P 8 only had a steam dome behind the sandbox; later a forward feed dome was added. Further constructional changes affected, inter alia, the driver's cab roofs, the smoke deflectors and various external assemblies. There would appear to have been a number of boiler variations. The following combinations can be seen in photographs: 1/. boiler feeds on sides on boiler, steam dome in front of sandbox 2/. boiler feeds on sides of boiler, steam dome behind sandbox 3/. boiler feeds on top of boiler without feed dome, steam dome behind sandbox 4/. boiler feeds on top of boiler with feed dome, steam dome behind sandbox At least some of very early engines (those with the \\"V\\" cabs) carried type (1) boilers and this type appears to have been the standard in the early years. Types (3) and (4) do not seem to have appeared until after World War I but ultimately became prevalent. See \\"100 Jahre Preussische P8\\" (Eisenbahn Kurier). In order to be able to turn the locomotive even on small turntables, the Prussian state railways fitted the P 8 with tenders that originally held 21.5 m¬≥ of water and 7 t of coal. Later the Deutsche Bundesbahn coupled the Class 38 with the tenders of withdrawn wartime locomotives the so-called 'Kriegslokomotiven', especially the bathtub tenders (Wannentender), which could carry more fuel. In addition the top speed when running tender-first was increased from to . On the other hand, the Deutsche Reichsbahn also used tenders of DRG Class 17 steam locomotives that had been taken out of service. These were the so-called long-distance tenders.  Employment  A P8 depicted by German artist Hans Baluschek (1909). The P 8 could haul 300 t at and 400 t at on the flat and, after the world wars, could be found in almost the whole of Europe. The order to build the first 10 machines was issued to the firm of Schwartzkopff (later the Berliner Maschinenbau) in 1906. With up to 14 express coaches attached, the trial runs went brilliantly. The first engine of this, soon internationally famous, class was placed into service in the Lower Rhine with the number \\"Coeln 2401\\". The P 8 could be used for a variety of duties and was found in heavy express train and goods train services heading almost every train. Even the railway authorities were very pleased with these engines, because the last P 8 locomotives were not mustered out by the Deutsche Reichsbahn until 1972, and by Deutsche Bundesbahn until 1974. More than 500 P 8 engines were in service for 50 years. The majority of the P 8 class engines were built by Schwartzkopff (later Berliner Maschinenbau) who produced 1025 units, followed by Henschel in Kassel with 742 units. Besides the Prussian state railways, the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways (Grossherzoglich Oldenburgische Staatseisenbahnen) also bought five and the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway (Grossherzoglich Mecklenburgische Friedrich-Franz- Eisenbahn) 13 machines. All German locomotive manufacturers later built Class P 8 locomotives including Hartmann and Esslingen. = P 8 Locomotives in the Baden State Railways = In order to compensate for the shortage of locomotives after the First World War as a result of ceasefire reparations and the large number of damaged locomotives, the Karlsruhe railway division reproduced 40 Prussian P 8 engines at the Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Karlsruhe. They were stationed in Villingen, Mannheim and Karlsruhe, and were given running numbers 1153 to 1192. Under the Deutsche Reichsbahn they were renumbered as 38 3793 to 38 3832 in 1925.  P 8 Locomotives in other countries Original Prussian P8 running on PKP (Polish State Railways) as class Ok1 in August 1976 CFR (CƒÉile Ferate Rom√¢ne, Romanian Railways) 230.000 class, built in Romania, double-heading at SƒÉli≈üte near Sibiu, 1972 In total 3,556 or 3,561 locomotives (according to different sources), were built for German states in 1906‚Äì1923, including 60 or 65 for occupation World War I service in Warsaw and Brussels.Scheingraber, Weisbrod (1993). pp. 32‚Äì36. Of these, 627 had to be transferred to the victorious powers as reparations after the end of the First World War: Poland received 192 (reclassified as the Ok1), Belgium 168 (type 64), France 162, Italy 25 (gruppo 675), Romania 18, Lithuania 11 and Greece 10 locomotives as SEK class ŒñŒ¥ (ZETA-delta). 41 locomotives were ceded to Saar railways. Up to 1923, the newly founded Deutsche Reichsbahn replenished the fleet of P 8 locos with new machines, and possessed 2933 machines in total, numbered 38 1001 to 3832 and 38 3951 to 4051. In addition to 3,556 or 3,561 produced for the German railways, 65 new locomotives were produced for Poland in 1922‚Äì1923 (as the PKP class Ok22), and 95 for Romania (as the CFR 230.000 class), in 1921‚Äì1930. Further 226 locomotives were licence-manufactured in Romania in 1932-1939. A total of 3,948 P 8 locomotives were built (including the inter-war built in Romania), which makes it the most numerous passenger train locomotive ever to be built in the world. After the Second World War, numbers 38 1069, 1391, 1434, 1677, 1809, 1818, 2052, 2692, 3264, 3495 und 3525 remained in Austria. Number 38 2052 was returned to the Deutsche Bundesbahn in 1952. Locomotives 38 1391, 1434, 1818, 3495 and 3525 went to the Soviet Union. The remaining machines formed the Austrian √ñBB Class 638. In 2004, the Austrian Society for Railway History (√ñGEG) acquired two machines of this type from Romania (the P 8 'copies'), one of which carries out steam 'specials' under the fictitious number of √ñBB 638.1301. Polish locomotives Ok1 were taken over by the Germany during World War II, but along with new reparations, Poland received 429 of former P 8 engines after the war, used in line service until 1981.Pawe≈Ç Terczy≈Ñski (2003): Atlas parowoz√≥w, Pozna≈Ñ, , p. 56 (in Polish) Three of the class were impounded by British forces after World War II in Norway. They were sent to Copenhagen for repair and eventually were purchased by the Danish State Railways where they became DSB class T numbered 297, 298 & 299\\\\. The last survivor was scrapped in 1973. = France = In France, the 162 locomotives received as reparations were divided between five railways: *The Chemins de fer de l'Est received 25 locomotives. They were renumbered 3311‚Äì3335 by the Est, and became 1-230.F.311 to 1-230.F.335 in the SNCF's R√©gion Est list. *The Chemins de fer d'Alsace-Lorraine received 25 locomotives. They were renumbered 2350‚Äì2374 by the AL, and the 22 survivors became 1-230.F.352 to 1-230.F.374 in the SNCF's R√©gion Est list. *The Chemins de fer du Nord received 75 locomotives. They were renumbered 3.1601 to 3.1675 by the Nord, and became 2-230.C.1 to 2-230.C.75 in the SNCF's R√©gion Nord list. *The Chemins de fer de l'√âtat received 17 locomotives. They were renumbered 230-943 to 230-958 by the √âtat, and the seven survivors became 3-230.E.943 to 3-230.E.958 in the SNCF's R√©gion Ouest list. *The Chemin de fer du Midi received 20 locomotives. There were renumbered 3701‚Äì3720 by the Midi, became 230-701 to 230-720 in the after the PO-Midi merger, and became 4-230.H.701 to 4-230.H.720 in the SNCF's R√©gion Sud-Ouest list. During World War II, many of the French P 8 locomotives were taken away by the German authorities, and while most returned, some were lost to East Germany and Poland. After the war, the SNCF decided to concentrate their P 8 locomotives on the R√©gion Est. The √âtat and its successor the R√©gion Ouest had hated its former German locomotives, and withdrawn them as quickly as possible. Consequently, only 3-230.E.943 was still in service in 1946 when it was transferred to R√©gion Est as 1-230.F.343. Of the former Midi locomotives, only 4-230.H.714 did not survive until 1946, when the remaining 19 became 1-230.F.401 to 1-230.F.420. In addition four German locomotives were discovered in France after the war, and these became 1-230.F.600 to 1-230.F.694; later 1-230.F.601 to 1-230.F.604. Between 1948 and 1950, R√©gion Nord had lent nine locomotives to Luxembourg as CFL 3902‚Äì3910. Four of these, along with 9 others were transferred to R√©gion Est in 1950, where they became 1-230.F.210 to 1-230.F.272. The Nord had made extensive use of its P 8s and retained as may as it could. The last P 8 on R√©gion Nord was retired in 1962, and the last on R√©gion Est in 1966.  Preserved P 8 Locomotives Prussian P 8 Steam Engine, built 1918 * One of the remaining P 8 locos is the 38 1182, that belongs to the DB Museum at Nuremberg (Verkehrsmuseum N√ºrnberg). It was built in 1910 by Schwartzkopff in Berlin and has been in operation for 61 years. As of 2008, it is stabled at the Gera engine shed (Bahnbetriebswerk Gera). * The Bochum-Dahlhausen Railway Museum (Eisenbahnmuseum Bochum- Dahlhausen) owns a working P 8, the 38 2267 (built 1918), that heads trains on nostalgic trips through the Ruhr area. * Number 38 3199 of the South German Railway Museum (S√ºddeutsches Eisenbahnmuseum) in Heilbronn has an unusual history. It was built in 1921 by the Linke-Hofmann locomotive factory in Breslau. It was initially designated as 2580 Elberfeld by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and later renumbered to 38 3199\\\\. It was last stationed at Breslau locomotive depot. As early as 1926 it was purchased by the Rumanian railways (CFR) and allocated number 230.106. In 1974 it was mothballed. Railway fans discovered it in the scrap yard and had it restored to full operation in Klausenburg in 1999 in the livery of the former Reichsbahn. Since 2002 the locomotive has been deployed again on museum services. * Since 1977, number 38 2383 has been at the German Steam Locomotive Museum (Deutsches Dampflokomotiv- Museum or DDM) in Neuenmarkt. It was built by Henschel in 1919 and was the penultimate P 8 in the Deutsche Bundesbahn. * In the Siegen locomotive shed is the last P8 in Deutsche Bundesbahn service. Officially paid off on December 5, 1974, number 38 1772 (since 1968 given the computerised number 038 772-0) was still in service until February 13, 1975, for farewell journeys. Built at Schichau in 1915, it had covered before its withdrawal. In the 1980s it was reactivated for steam specials by railway fans. Since it had to be taken out of service in 1993, number 38 1772 is preserved as a mobile memorial. * In The Polish Railways PKP depot at Wolsztyn the Ok1-359, formerly 38 2155, remains operational. P 8 2455 Posen in Leipzig * State railway trips / Manuel Jussen is the owner of the P 8 engine '2455 Posen', which is stabled at the Dieringhausen Railway Museum (Eisenbahnmuseum Dieringhausen). Number 2455 Posen was built in 1919 by the Linke-Hofmann factory in Breslau under the running number 1804. Sold by the DRG to Romania in August 1926, it was operated there under the number 230 094 until about 1974. After its sale to the present owner in spring 1998 it was restored in Romania in 2001. It represents the period of the early 1920s. The locomotive was used since 2008 as motive power for the \\"train of remembrance\\" (Zug der Erinnerung). * The Austrian Railway History Company (√ñGEG) owns an operational P 8 copy of Romanian origin. * In B√∂blingen-Hulb, near Stuttgart, number 38 3650 stands in the car park of a shopping center. It was supplied in 1922 as Elberfeld 3097 to the (Hamburg-)Harburg shed, was on duty there until 1945 and was withdrawn from service in 1972 in T√ºbingen. Number 38 3650 then stood immobilized in Bahnhof Breitenholz until about the early eighties and then was sold to the shopping center to attract customers. Standing in the open there, the loco has meanwhile become very run down. PFT 64.169 On the Chemin de fer du Bocq touristic line * The Belgian heritage railway Patrimoine Ferroviaire et Tourisme (PFT-TSP) bought in 2002 (and transferred in March 2007) a refurbished P8 from Romania. This former CFR 230 084 was repainted in Belgian livery and numbered 64 169 (as National Railway Company of Belgium has owned 168 P8 class 64). It had been manufactured by Henschel with the factory number 18939. In 2013, this loc had a new boiler certification and is authorized to run on the whole Belgian rail network (at 80 km/h). * The National Railway Company of Belgium has preserved 64.045 in non-running condition, with the tender of 22.153. 64.045 was built by Henschel in 1916, and is currently stored in the museum-depot of Bruges, not open to the public.  Remarks  As early as the end of the 1930s the Deutsche Reichsbahn planned to replace the now ageing P8 by a new locomotive. This led to the development of the DRG Class 23, of which only 2 examples had been built, however, by 1941. In 1950 the Deutsche Bundesbahn began to use the more advanced DB Class 23 as a replacement for the P8. The factories produced 105 examples by 1951. The change of motive power meant that the last Class 23 was withdrawn by the DB only one year after the last P8 had been retired.

Their settlements were first established in the 1920s. In 1922, 3,000 Mennonites from the Canadian province of Manitoba established in Chihuahua. By 1927, Mennonites reached 10,000 and they were established in Chihuahua, Durango and Guanajuato. Worsening poverty, water shortages and drug-related violence across northern Mexico have provoked significant numbers of Mennonites living in Durango and Chihuahua to relocate abroad in recent years, especially to Canada, and to other regions of Latin America. Between 2012 and 2017 alone, it is estimated that at least 30,000 Mexican Mennonites emigrated to Canada.  History Background= The ancestors of the vast majority of Mexican Mennonites settled in the Russian Empire in the late 18th and 19th centuries, coming from the Vistula delta in West Prussia. Even though these Mennonites are Dutch and Prussian by ancestry, language and custom, they are generally called Russian Mennonites, Russland-Mennoniten in German. In the years after 1873, some 7,000 left the Russian Empire and settled in Canada. In the period leading up to and during World War I, governments in the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan passed laws requiring public schools to fly the Union Jack, required compulsory attendance, and created public schools in areas of Mennonite settlement. In response the more conservative Mennonites sent out delegates to a number of countries to seek out a new land for settlement. They finally settled in a tract of land in Northern Mexico after negotiating certain privileges with Mexican President √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n. Approximately 6,000 of the most conservative Mennonites eventually left Manitoba and Saskatchewan for Mexico. The first train left Plum Coulee, Manitoba, on March 1, 1922. =Migration= Between 1922 and 1925, some 3,200 members of the Reinlaender Gemeinde in Manitoba and 1,200 from the Swift Current area left Canada to settle in Northern Mexico on approximately of land in the Bustillos Valley near present-day Cuauht√©moc, Chihuahua. The Manitoba and Swift Current area groups settled the Manitoba and Swift Colonies in Chihuahua, while about 950 Mennonites from the Hague-Osler settlement in Saskatchewan settled on in Durango near Nuevo Ideal. In 1927 some 7,000 Mennonites from Canada lived in Mexico.\\"Mexico\\" at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online After 1924, another 200 Mennonite families (some 1,000 persons) from Soviet Russia, tried to settle in Mexico. But in the end only 6 out of the 200 families from Russia remained in Mexico. Between 1948 and 1952, some 595 persons of the Kleine Gemeinde in Manitoba bought and settled the Quellenkolonie. They were joined by 246 Old Colony settlers from Manitoba and Saskatchewan, but most of these settlers either soon returned to Canada or left the colony.\\"Mexico\\" at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online = Settlements = The Mennonites established farms, machine shops and motorized vehicles for transporting produce (although automobiles were forbidden for common use). Canadian oats, beans and corn were the main produce. The villages followed Mennonite architectural styles existent in Russia and Canada and the names were based on former names in Canada such as Rosenort, Steinbach and Sch√∂nwiese. The colonies were based on former Mennonite social structures in terms of education, similar prayer houses and unsalaried ministers. Conservative dress and traditional roles for women were the norm.  Present  Mennonite family in Campeche. In Chihuahua, Mennonites continue their lifestyle with several reforms, such as the use of automobiles. They coexist, learning Spanish and English and living side by side with the Castizo in the hill country of the state. During the harvest season they employ a considerable number of Tarahumara people from the nearby Copper Canyon area. About 50,000 Mennonites reside near the city of Cuauht√©moc in Chihuahua. In Durango, there are 32 Mennonite communities (30 in Nuevo Ideal Municipality and 2 in Santiago Papasquiaro Municipality). Mennonites in Durango number reached a top of 8,000 in 2011, now they are 6,500; most of them live in Nuevo Ideal. Nuevo Ideal's lies around north of the city of Durango. Once in Nuevo Ideal, it becomes central transit point where the main roads that communicate Northwest and Northeast Durango separate (the road going northwest to Santa Catarina de Tepehuanes is paved while the one going to Escobedo, Durango towards the northeast, is a dirt road). Mennonites benefit from this transit point since many travelers and truck drivers stop in Nuevo Ideal in search of Menonita Cheese. The largest denomination as of 2006 is Old Colony Mennonite Church with 17,200 members, Kleingemeinde in Mexiko has 2,150 members, Sommerfelder Mennonitengemeinde has 2,043 members, Reinl√§nder-Gemeinde has 1,350 members, and Evangelical Mennonite Mission Conference has 97 members The community of Chihuahua separates themselves into \\"conservative\\" and \\"liberal\\", with the liberal faction accounting for 20% of the population. This group is more open to outsiders and as such, more likely to marry outside of the community than their conservative peers. It is also more common for this group to adopt Tarahumara and Mestizo children. These children grow up as any other Mennonite would, learning German in school and helping out in the community. Since the start of the Mexican Drug War, many Mennonite colonies in Chihuahua have suffered the impact of the drug-related violence. The location of the colonies and the economic success of the Mennonites are the reasons why the community has been affected. The economic achievements have attracted the attention of organized criminal gangs, putting Mennonites at risk of armed robbery, kidnap and extortion. These factors have led Mennonites from northern Mexico to emigrate to other Mennonite settlements in Alberta, Canada, Belize and Paraguay to escape the violence. Thousands have moved and settled in more secure Mexican states like Campeche, or moved to South America, in countries like Argentina and Bolivia.http://www.nuevoidealdurango.com/?p=689 Some Mennonites were, in fact, convicted of drug running in the 1990s. There have been fresh accusations more recently. In 2014, Abraham Friesen-Remple was one of six members of the Northern Mexico's Mennonite community who were indicted and accused of smuggling marijuana in the gas tanks of cars and inside farm equipment. During 2007, the colony of Salamanca (a Mennonite settlement with a population of 800 spread over in the state of Quintana Roo) was completely destroyed due to the landfall of Hurricane Dean. As of 2008, Salamanca had a population of 862. A number of congregations of Conservative Mennonites have been established throughout Mexico including La Esperanza and Pedernales in Chihuahua (state), La Honda, Zacatecas, and more recently Oaxaca. In addition to escalating drug-related violence and worsening poverty in Mexico, Mennonites living in Chihuahua and Durango have had to contend with extended periods of droughts as well as tensions with non-Mennonite farmers over access to water. The combination of these factors has provoked significant numbers of Mennonites in the region to emigrate abroad, especially to Canada and South America, in recent years. From 2012 to 2017 alone, it is estimated that 30,000 Mexican Mennonites relocated to Canada.

Life A Catholic convert aged 14, he went first to Reims, in 1586, then to the English College, Rome, 1589-94. Returning to Belgium, he entered the Jesuit novitiate, 2 May 1594, and then set out for England in 1596. He was, however, arrested by the Dutch, tortured, and sent prisoner to London. He managed to escape, and became the companion of Father Gerard in several adventures. He was seized at Great Harrowden (November, 1605) at the time of the Gunpowder Plot, but was eventually banished at the request of the Spanish ambassador (1606). Retiring to Belgium he was for a time head of the English Jesuits, then professor of Scripture at the Jesuit house of studies in Leuven, after which he returned again to England. He was again imprisoned and condemned to death (1610). He had already begun to write on current controversies, and when James I of England desired a series of disputations in 1622, Percy, who was then in a prison in London, was required to defend the Catholic side. In these disputations King James himself and William Laud took a leading part. These controversies were afterwards printed and discussed by Percy and John Floyd on the Catholic side, and by Laud, Francis White, John White, Daniel Featley, and Anthony Wotton on the Protestant.W.

The Lancashire nobby originated in Morecambe Bay about 1840 and around Southport. It subsequently came into widespread use down the north west coast of England. The Manx nobby first appeared in the 1880s and was used around the Isle of Man. Many localities on the coast of Great Britain developed their own type of fishing boat adapted to local fishing and sea conditions, and the nobbies are examples of this.March (1969) Lancashire nobby The Lancashire nobby was primarily a shrimp trawler towing beam trawls sized for common \\"brown shrimp\\" (Crangon crangon), \\"pink shrimp\\" or \\"Aesop prawn\\" (Pandalus montagui), or flatfish. The nobby ranged in size from about for single-handed boats and from for two-man boats. They were all pole masted cutters with gaff topsail.Miller (2009) In the north west of England the Morecambe Bay nobby emerged about 1840 as the local type. Houldsworth illustrated them as a sloop rigged craft with a square tuck sternHoldsworth A report in the Lancaster Gazette of 7 November 1840 indicates that Southport smacks were also fishing in Morecambe Bay, providing another progenitor of the nobby. The design evolved from earlier straight- stemmed, long-keel boats into a beamy shallow hull with a pronounced reverse curve in the midship section and a cut away forefoot. The square tuck stern changed into an immersed elliptical counter, either by evolution or adoption of the Southport form, the change being complete before 1880. All of the boats had wide side decks and a long cockpit, about a third of the beam in width, with low freeboard and a low rail to facilitate lifting the gear on board. These shrimp boats, about , were fast and handy in the shallow waters of Morecambe Bay. The larger boats were called ‚Äúprawners‚Äù, though they were actually used to catch pink shrimps (Pandalus montagui). In addition to the larger prawner (called \\"sprawner\\" at Morecambe) a subtype called \\"bay boat\\" developed for the holiday trade. The bay boat had a shallow draft so it could operate around Grange-over-Sands at the head of Morecambe Bay. Crossfields of Arnside were the most prolific builders with two yards working. Later branches of the family started yards at Conway and took over a yard at Hoylake. Many were constructed by Gibson at Fleetwood, later taken over by Liver and Wilding. In particular, William Stoba (1855‚Äì1931), a foreman shipwright with Fleetwood builders, developed the design and experimented with centreboards. Other builders were working at Annan, Millom, Crossens and Marshside near Southport. The type was adopted by fishermen from the Solway down to Cardigan Bay, and hundreds of nobbies were built. The demand for boats was driven by the English taste for shrimps, which in its turn was driven by the English sea side holiday trade, which came to prominence with the railways in the 1850s. There was no standard design of nobby, alterations were made to suit the ideas of the original owners. Three racing classes, the Royal Mersey Restricted class, the Royal Mersey Rivers class and the Fleetwood Jewel Class, were built on nobby lines by various local boat builders. The difference between these was that the Royal Mersey Restricted class and the Fleetwood Jewels Class were cutter rigged same as a Nobby and the Royal Mersey Rivers Class had a single headsail. It is important to understand that the two types (Manx and Lancashire) are completely different. The shrimping boats (Morecambe Bay, Liverpool etc.) are shallow draught vessels [typically ] designed to trawl in the shoal waters of the Solway Firth, Morecambe Bay etc. In contrast, the Manx Nobby is a herring lugger, a deep-water vessel typically drawing and built to lie to nets in deep water while drift net fishing for herring and mackerel. The Manx Nobby is similar to the cornish luggers. =Period of decline= At other nobby ports the changing economics of fishing with engines meant that fewer new nobbys were built, so that most of the nobby builders retired from trade during the Second World War. The nobbies went into gradual decline, and were eventually sold cheaply and converted to yachtsBurbo Bank Wind Farm Information, April 2008 Over the last 20 years the Nobby Owners Association has restored to sail some 20 nobbies, which are basically Morecambe Bay inshore sail fishing boats, associated with the North West coast of England and which evolved to their present graceful form through the 19th century.Ireland's boating heritage - the future? Manx nobby The Manx nobby was a double ended standing lug-rigged herring drifter. It was preceded by the \\"nickie\\", which had a dipping lug rigging. Standing lugs have yards that remain on one side of the mast and the tack is set close to the mast, while dipping lugs have yards that dip around the mast when going about so that the sail draws away from the mast on each tack. The Nickies were copies of Cornish herring drifters that visited Man. The Manx Nickie was so called as Nicholas was a common Christian name amongst the Cornish crews whose boats they copied. The change to standing lug was driven by a shortage of experienced crew. This type of craft was then commissioned by The Congested Districts Board to provide a decked fishing craft to be used in Connemara, Ireland in the 1890s.Scott The vocabulary of the Anglo-Manx dialect quotes the first Manx nobby in 1884 receiving its name because it was ‚Äúa rale nobby little thing‚Äù. Other nobbies may have received their name in the same way, as smart sail fishing boats. NotesReferences * Holdsworth E W H (1874), Deep Sea Fishing and Fishing Boats.

It was owned as a joint venture between InterMedia Partners (which owned a controlling 92% interest) and NBCUniversal (which owned the remaining 8%). HistoryWorld Championship Sports Network= The channel was launched in 2006 as World Championship Sports Network (WCSN); it was co-founded by Claude Ruibal (who served as its chairman and chief executive officer) and Tom Hipkins (who served as a member of the channel's board of directors), with the help of Carlos Silva (its president and chief operating officer). One of the first events broadcast by WCSN was coverage of the United States Track and Field Championships via streaming video. In 2007, InterMedia Partners gained a majority ownership interest in the network. By March 2008, WCSN began to be carried on broadcast television, through the digital subchannels of several stations owned by the Granite Broadcasting Corporation. =Universal Sports= NBCUniversal entered into a partnership with InterMedia in which the former acquired a minority interest in the channel; in addition, on June 16, 2008, the network was rebranded as Universal Sports, incorporating a new logo with the NBC peacock. By November 2008, all 10 of NBC's owned-and-operated stations had begun carrying the network on one of their digital subchannels. Universal Sports offered carriage on broadcast stations on a channel lease basis until 2011, with the provision that the stations strike deals with cable providers in their markets to carry the network by January 31, 2009. If a station failed to obtain cable carriage, the network had the right to move its affiliation to another station in that market that would be able to gain cable carriage. The network was being shopped to NBC-affiliated stations until December 1. On June 17, 2010, Universal Sports, along with the International Rugby Board, announced that the channel would bring \\"unprecedented national television and digital media coverage of the 2011 and 2015 Rugby World Cup tournaments\\". On October 22, 2015, it was announced that Universal Sports would close down on November 16, 2015, and that NBC Sports would inherit the network's portfolio of sports rights for its own networks (such as NBC, NBCSN and Universal HD). The channel shut down at 6AM on that day; with the documentary \\"5 Peaks in a Day from Switzerland\\" being the network's last program. On July 1, 2017, the United States Olympic Committee and the NBC Sports Group launched the Olympic Channel, effectively serving as Universal Sports' eventual replacement channel. =Carriage= On June 15, 2011, DirecTV added Universal Sports as a national basic channel. The carriage agreement with DirecTV led NBCUniversal and Intermedia to announce on September 12, 2011, that it would transition Universal Sports into a cable- and satellite-exclusive service (effectively dropping its over-the-air affiliates) by January 2012. On January 1, 2012, Universal Sports was dropped by most cable providers as a result of a protracted battle to get them to offer the service as a premium channel. One of the providers to drop the channel was Comcast, the nation's largest cable company and part-owner of Universal Sports' co-parent NBCUniversal at the time (it would later acquire the remaining ownership interest held by General Electric in 2013) Programming The channel had long-term broadcasting agreements with the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the International Cycling Union (UCI), the International Federation of Gymnastics (FIG), the International Rowing Federation (FISA), the International Ski Federation (FIS), the International Swimming Federation (FINA), and the International Rugby Board (IRB). The channel provided year- round coverage of events that generally receive attention every few years. Through television carriage and internet streaming, viewers were provided an in-depth look at how Olympic athletes compete between the games. Universal Sports promoted itself as \\"the athlete's network,\\" and extended its coverage through blogs and interviews outside of competition. As reported by Olympic news outlet Around the Rings, Universal Sports and Infront Sports and Media announced an exclusive media rights agreement for the International Ski Federation World Cup events beginning with the 2011‚Äì2012 season.

Originally called the Northern Separation Movement, the aim of the movement was to seek the secession of the New England region and surrounding areas from the State of New South Wales (NSW) and the establishment of a new State of New England. While initially popular and the subject of two Royal Commissions, the movement was ultimately unsuccessful, following defeat at a referendum in 1967. Geographical description Because New England has never had a formal identity, its claimed boundaries have varied with time. In broad terms, it covers the humid coastal strip including the Hunter Region to the Queensland border, the New England Tablelands and the immediately adjoining Western Slopes and Plains. In economic and geographic terms, New England forms a natural unit that has survived to the present day. In political terms, the boundaries have varied. The initial separation discussions excluded the Hunter, in part because of tensions between the industrial and mining heartland of the lower Hunter and the rest of the area. This created a problem because an urban/industrial centre like Newcastle and the Hunter were seen as an essential part of New England, or any new state, in economic and geographic terms. The boundaries recommended by the 1935 report of the Nicholas Royal Commission into areas of NSW suitable for self- government included Newcastle and the Hunter. These boundaries were adopted by the New England New State Movement and used as the basis for the 1967 self- government referendum. Name New England was initially called Northern NSW, the North, the Northern Districts or the Northern Provinces. The name New England was originally the name of the Tableland area forming New England's core. The Tablelands are known as the Northern Tablelands, the New New England Tablelands or sometimes just the New England to distinguish them from the broader New England area. The name New England was adopted for the whole area by the Northern Separation Movement at its 1931 Maitland convention. From there its usage spread, contracting again as the new state movement went into decline after 1967. New state agitation Earle Page, founder of the New State movement and later Prime Minister of Australia The first separatist agitation occurred during colonial times at the time of the separation of Queensland from NSW. While this was followed by outbreaks of agitation, these remained sporadic. This changed in the twentieth century. Agitation began again at Grafton towards the end of the First World War led by Earle Page, a local doctor and later a prominent politician, rising to caretaker Prime Minister of Australia. This was picked up a little later by Victor Thompson, editor of the Tamworth Northern Daily Leader who launched a sustained newspaper campaign that involved papers as far south as Cessnock in the lower Hunter. This led to the creation of a formal movement. In 1922 a formal request to the Commonwealth was made by the lower house to establish a new state in northern New South Wales. One outcome was the 1924 Cohen Royal Commission into New States. The Cohen Commission ruled against to the movement and it went into decline, resurging at the start of the Great Depression. This forced another Royal Commission, the Nicholas Commission. While this recommended in favour, the movement was again in decline as economic conditions improved. Agitation started again at the end of the Second World War and this time was sustained by permanent staff. In 1953, 21 councils defied the state government and held unofficial referendum on the issue of a new state. The people voted overwhelmingly in favour of the referendum. In 1961 the movement launched Operation Seventh State, raising over AU¬£100,000. This allowed more staff and greater agitation. This acceptance of boundaries determined by the Nicholas Commission proved to be the movement's critical strategic error. It assumed that a state was not viable unless it was dominated by a large urban population on the English/London model. Yet, the evidence from similar federations like Canada and the USA revealed numerous successful \\"farm states\\", like Wyoming, Montana and the Dakotas, with comparatively small capital city populations tied to a single, essentially rural community of interest. This metrocentric mindset ensured that two quite distinct communities of interest were being pressured into a doomed arranged marriage. It was also the very antithesis of an \\"act of free choice\\" as that choice involved imposing a majority rural will over a geographically distinct urban community. A new state proposal based in most part on boundaries formed by those Local Councils with majorities that actually wanted the change would have acquired a critical momentum. Premier Robert Askin and the Cabinet believed in 1966 that a secession referendum would win, so they had the upper Hunter Region and Newcastle included within the boundaries of the proposed new state before putting it to a vote. Referendum A referendum of New England electors was held on 29 April 1967. The no vote was led by the Australian Labor Party who campaigned hard. The referendum was narrowly defeated with 54% voting no. The very high no vote in the Labor strongholds of Newcastle and the Lower Hunter offset the majority yes vote elsewhere, although the no margin was not high. The threat of restricted access to the highly regulated Sydney milk and dairy products market also boosted the no vote in rural areas. Despite this defeat, four New State candidates stood for election at the 1968 state election and gained 0.80% of the total state vote with Garry Nehl, in the seat of Clarence, winning 35% of the primary vote. However this was a brief twilight in the campaign and, exhausted, the movement again went into decline for the next four decades. 21st century revival The movement underwent a resurgence in 2004, primarily in response to State (Labor) Government shire amalgamations and farmers responses to new vegetation management policies. The Annual General Meetings of NSW Farmers passed resolutions to investigate the feasibility of a non-metropolitan state in both 2004 and 2005. A task force was formed chaired by then NSWF President Mr Malcolm Peters. Some polling was commissioned and a convention was held but little further effort appears to have taken place. A group of dedicated activists continue to agitate for a new state in the area. Presently this is carried out in an informal sense or through social media such as a dedicated Facebook page.

The question is whether the European Union's discrimination policy covers not just people who are disabled (or have a particular sex, race, religion, belief and age) but people who suffer discrimination because they are related or connected to disabled people. At the beginning of 2008, Advocate General Maduro delivered his opinion, supporting an inclusive approach. He said discrimination law is there to combat all forms of discrimination, including those connected to protected groups of people. Facts Sharon Coleman had a disabled son, Oliver, with bronchomalacia and congential laryngomalacia. She worked as a secretary for a small London law firm called Attridge Law (now rebranded EBR Attridge Solicitors LLP). They accused her of using her child as a way to manipulate requests for working time. Coleman, represented by London law firm Bates Wells Braithwaite, claimed unfair dismissal as a result of her treatment (under the Employment Rights Act 1996, s.94). However, under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 s 4, it states that one may consider oneself discriminated against (leading to unfair dismissal compensation) only if the treatment is \\"against a disabled person\\". Because Coleman was not herself disabled, the question was whether the 1995 Act had properly implemented the European Union Directive 2000/78/EC on the matter. In their defence against the claim for, Attridge law argued that the 1995 Act could not be interpreted in line with the directive, whatever it meant. Since then, Jayanee has disputed this ruling and taken matters to the Civil Courts JudgmentEmployment Appeal Tribunal= Peter Clark J for the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that it was wrong to say the Act could not be interpreted in line with the Directive. But he reserved his judgment and decided to refer the question to the European Court of Justice, on what the correct interpretation of Directive =Advocate General's Opinion= In the Advocate General's Opinion, Miguel Poiares Maduro generalised his statements for all the protected categories under the Framework Directive (religion, age, sexuality). He said, ‚ÄúOne way of undermining the dignity and autonomy of people who belong to a certain group is to target not them, but third persons who are closely associated with them and do not themselves belong to the group.\\" (para. 12) The preparatory argument is built around the driving force behind Article 13 TEC, on which the Directive is based. Then is cited Ronald Dworkin's philosophy on what it means to protect dignity, that it is a fundamental value for everyone, even among those who disagree about how it is realised. He also referred to Joseph Raz, on the idea that autonomy presupposes that individuals have available number of valuable choices, and the law is to be concerned in protecting them. From the law itself, Maduro relies on the wording of the first Article of the Directive which says it wants to combat discrimination 'on the grounds of' those categories. He characterises the action against Sharon as direct discrimination (para. 20). Comparing typical discrimination to this, he says, \\"In the former case, we think that such conduct is wrong and must be prohibited; the latter is exactly the same in every material aspect.\\" (para. 22) Also, recital 6, emphasises 'the importance of combating every form of discrimination.' (para. 24) Statistically, 80% of Advocate General's opinions are followed. =European Court of Justice= The ECJ released its judgment on 31 July 2008, and held that Sharon Coleman would succeed in her suit against the law firm. It did not follow from the relevant provisions of Directive 2000/78 that the principle of equal treatment is limited to people who themselves have a disability within the meaning of the Directive: > On the contrary, the purpose of the Directive, as regards employment and > occupation, is to combat all forms of discrimination on grounds of > disability. The principle of equal treatment enshrined in the Directive in > that area applies not to a particular category of person but by reference to > the grounds mentioned in Article 1. That interpretation is supported by the > wording of Article 13 EC, which constitutes the legal basis of Directive > 2000/78, and which confers on the Community the competence to take > appropriate action to combat discrimination based, inter alia, on > disability. Commenting on the judgment, Lucy McLynn, partner at Bates Wells Braithwaite, said: \\"It is a great victory for common sense and for legal clarity, as well as for Sharon personally.\\" https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jul/17/law.employeebenefits The decision may have a significant impact on people in the UK who are not currently protected by discrimination legislation. 6 million carers exist in the UK currently, and with an ageing population, 9 million are projected by 2037 according to Carers UK. =Further proceedings before the Employment Tribunal= On its return to the Employment Tribunal, the law firm appealed against a preliminary ruling that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to entertain the claim. On that preliminary point, in EBR Attridge Law LLP & Anor v Coleman [2009] UKEAT 0071 09 3010 (30 October 2009) the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that for an employer to treat an able-bodied employee caring for a disabled child less favourably than another employee in a comparable situation was associative discrimination, notwithstanding the specific references in the Disabilit. The case was remitted to the first-instance Tribunal for a full hearing.

It is located on U.S. Route 44 and is visible off New York State Route 22 and New York State Route 343. In 1974, the land upon which the park is located was sold to the Town of Amenia by Walter Beekman for the sum of $1. The park was officially opened in 1983. Before the park existed, it was the site of Lake Amenia, formed in the 1920s by a freshwater dam over a sawmill pond at the intersection of Lake Amenia Road and West Lake Amenia Road. The dam's original use was to power a nearby saw mill where, with the new lake in place, people now had the opportunity to swim. During the 1920s, the lake became surrounded by cottages, pavilions, docks, and some railings. Lake Amenia remained intact for another 30 years, however, in 1955, Hurricane Diane struck the area and eradicated any trace of the lake. The storm's heavy rains caused the lake's water gates to fail. The resulting flood drained the lake. This area is now part of the New York State Wetlands. In 1974, the land that makes up the park, including the remains of the lake, now the wetlands, were sold to the Town of Amenia for a single dollar, by Walter Beekman. Groups of volunteers began construction on the park, which included ball fields. The park officially opened in 1983, with the first Little League games being played on one of their fields, with two more fields soon after. The park remains in active use to this date. History of Lake Amenia Main intersection in Amenia of routes 22 and 343, near the northern edge of where Lake Amenia used to sit. On the site of Beekman Park was the former Lake Amenia, a shallow, one and a half acre-wide freshwater lake in the center of Amenia. The lake first originated as a millpond for a local corn and grain mill in the area. Eventually, the mill changed over to a sawmill, and during the 1920s, a dam was built in the millpond, creating Lake Amenia. The lake had two streams that flowed water in and out of the body. One ran near the local pizzeria and one ran near the current-day tennis courts. The freshwater lake became an instant tourist destination two hours north of New York City. People took advantage of the lake, including Beekman and Beekman Inc., a tourist agency developed by two brothers. They used the area around Lake Amenia to develop theaters and a living environment. The lake even had a cemetery built in one of the islands, which exists to this date as Amenia Island Cemetery. People would come to the lake for vacationing, which included a pool hall in the post office, beaches, and even a brand new golf course. Summer vacationers would take the train to Amenia Station on the New York Central Railroad to visit the lakeside resorts and summer camps on the lake. As popular as the community had become, there were no doubts that the end of vacationing in Amenia would soon imminent. In 1955, during the destruction left by Hurricane Diane swept through New York and Pennsylvania, the dam on Lake Amenia burst. Local folklore claims the floodgates to open Lake Amenia's dam were supposed to be opened for the high waters. However, the dam keeper dropped his keys into the rushing waters of Lake Amenia, and the resulting outflow caused a catastrophe. The flooding overtook much of the community, including the golf course, and although the flooding receded, the dam was never repaired. The community could not adapt to the sweeping changes from flooding and the popular community became an economic ghost town. Locals reported that the once busy streets of Amenia became empty storefronts. Much of the lake drained into wetlands, some of which has been adaptive into the Wassaic portion of the New York State Wetlands. People often would comment that Lake Amenia Road, named after the lake on the southern side of Beekman Park, served no lake. Currently The fields at Beekman Park, the ball fields are important in Amenia After the flooding of Hurricane Diane, the former wetlands became the ownership of Walter Beekman from Beekman and Beekman Inc. He kept ownership of the land for only nineteen years before selling the land to the town of Amenia in 1974 for one dollar. The land remained unkept at that point, until the 1980s, when groups of volunteers (funded by the town) started installing ball fields and park like scenery. In 1983, Beekman Park was open for business as the new local park. In 1985, the local baseball fields started hosting their own games for locals team on the local Don Herring Field. Some of the former lake remains, including a portion of the former dam in the southwestern corner of the park, and Amenia Island Cemetery still stands along New York State Route 343 towards Sharon, Connecticut, but on stable ground. On May 14, 2009, the town of Amenia secured $3,829 (2009 USD) from their recreation fund to help make improvements to Beekman Park, and on June 11, 2009, the money distribution was approved. The park is made up mainly of three baseball and softball fields. The three fields are named after famous players in Amenia, including one named for William \\"Doc\\" Bartlett, which was opened in 1985. There are some undeveloped parts, with a house running along the northern edge of the park. At the northeast corner, there is a remnant of the old dam that impounded former Lake Amenia. There are two ways to access Beekman Park, one by foot and one by car. The first is on U.S. Route 44, where the parking lot (which holds approximately 75 cars), is located. The second, a pedestrian entrance, is at Broadway and East Broadway Avenues.

It was the first iteration of the seventh and last generation of this Australian-made model. Its range no longer featured the Fairmont luxury badge, replaced instead by the G Series. Introduction and changes The FG series Falcon was first previewed at a press event on 17 February 2008 and sold until October 2014. ;Range change To make a fresh start, Ford Australia decided to revolutionize the designation of all models within the range. In particular, the long-standing Futura, Fairmont, and Fairmont Ghia models were replaced by the more contemporary G6 and G6E models, respectively. The FG moniker references the now discontinued Fairmont Ghia. The FG was superseded in December 2014, by the FG X series. ;Powertrains The standard FG Falcon engine is a 24-valve 4.0-Litre in-line six with VCT; which produces peak power of at 6000 rpm and peak torque of at 3250 rpm. From July 2010 production all I6 engines (excluding E-Gas models) meet Euro 4 emission standards. The ZF six-speed auto is the only transmission available (excluding XR models which feature a six-speed manual transmission standard, with the option of the auto). This combined with hardware updates has improved fuel consumption to for all entry level naturally aspirated petrol sedans and for the equivalent utility variants. The high-performance turbocharged version of the in-line-six produces at 5250 rpm and of torque from 1950 rpm; this engine is available in the XR6 Turbo and G6E Turbo. The Turbo variant makes as much as of torque at just 1500 rpm. In 2011, Ford introduced a new LPG system to the Falcon, marketed as \\"EcoLPI\\" the system features liquid injection as opposed to the vapour set up used in the previous E-Gas system. The new injection set up is accompanied by new light weight pistons and rings, a higher compression ratio of 12.0:1 and other modifications that improve power and economy. The power has risen 27% from to at 5000 rpm and torque has risen 10% from to at 3250 rpm. These figures virtually match the petrol version for power and torque when running on 95 octane fuel. In addition to the power gains, fuel use has dropped by around 15% while moreover the peak power of is reached at just 5000rpm. In addition to the engine improvements, the new LPG system now features a 6-speed automatic as standard. The new system was available from July 2011 and was an option on models fitted with the naturally aspirated 6-cylinder engine. Ford introduced the 2.0L Ecoboost engine in 2012 which will reputedly use 20 percent less fuel and emit significantly less CO2 emissions than the current 4.0L engine. The engine will have at least and , peak torque will be available from 2,000 rpm all the way to 5,500 rpm.Ford announces 2.0L Ecoboost and dual clutch gearbox for 2010 Retrieved from green.autoblog.com The fuel consumption is estimated at roughly . The Falcon will be the first rear drive application using the Ecoboost engine, however, not capable of matching of torque available at as low as 1500 rpm on the 4.0L petrol version. ;Safety The FG range achieved an ANCAP five star safety rating, being the first Australian manufactured car to do so, achieving a score of 34.6 out of 37. Model range The Ford FG Falcon comprised 7 different trim levels, divided into 3 three distinct groups: * the base Falcon * the luxury G6 series * the sports Falcon XR. The specific models included the Falcon XT, the luxury G6, G6E, G6E Turbo, and the sports XR6, XR6 Turbo and XR8. The ute variants included the base Falcon Ute, R6, XR6, XR6 Turbo and XR8. ;Falcon XT The XT is the base model of the FG Falcon range. The XT has a business class suspension tune: the rear suspension is Ford's Control Blade IRS, and the front suspension is virtual pivot link, the same architecture as found in the Territory. The brakes are carried over from the BF Falcon. The engine is the revised I6 Barra Engine which now produces at 6000 rpm and of torque. The naturally aspirated XT engine specification is identical to the non-turbo XR6, G6, G6E and Utility vehicle variants powered by the 4.0L engine. At launch, the standard transmission was a new 5-speed auto, replacing the previous Australian designed and made 4-speed. The ZF 6-speed auto was optional from the launch in 2008. In July 2010, the 6-speed was made standard. Both the 5- and the 6- speed retain the 2.73:1 final open differential ratio with LSD optional on XR6 models. The new styling is based around the kinetic design Ford Europe uses for their cars. The interior has been improved from the previous model. The centre console has been lifted to make for a more luxurious and spacious feeling. The interior is more roomy and has better entry and exit for front and rear passengers. The XT is now better equipped, it has a MP3 compatible CD player, auxiliary audio input jack, single zone automatic climate control, cruise control, 60/40 split fold-down rear seat back, front and rear power windows, four airbags, Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) with Emergency Brake Assist and a driver fatigue warning system.\\"Ford Falcon XT Key Features\\" From 1 September 2008, all XT models have been specified with alloy wheels as standard equipment, previously an extra-cost option This replaced the standard 16\\" x 6.5\\" steel wheels that used plastic wheel covers or center hub caps. ;Falcon XR6 The base model in the XR range, which features the same 4.0L I6 engine found in the XT, G6 and G6E. It has the same features as the XT, plus a 6-Speed manual transmission, 17 x 8-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels; optional 18- and 19-inch are available, Sports Control Blade Independent Rear Suspension (IRS), Sports body kit with side skirts and rear bumper, rear spoiler, front fog lamps, leather-wrapped steering wheel with mounted audio controls, alloy pedal covers and cloth sports seats. It can also be had with an automatic transmission, with a choice of 5 or 6-speed. Both having slightly quicker acceleration than the manual variant. As of July 2010, the 5-speed automatic is no longer available. ;Falcon XR6 Turbo The Turbo model of the XR6 comes with all of the features of the standard XR6 plus 18 x 8-inch five-spoke alloy wheels, limited slip differential, and upgraded front brakes (322mm rotors instead of the standard 298mm) without an option for 328mm x 26mm ventilated rear discs as found on BF Mk1 XR6T and XR8 models, losing on the braking capacity overall with 303mmx16mm solid rear discs, the same hardware found on the original BA XT from 2002. It uses the same 4.0L I6 Turbo engine that is found in the G6E Turbo. The six-speed automatic transmission used in turbocharged models is the 6HP26 which is rated to handle more torque than the 6HP21 used in non-turbo models. Performance wise, it is considered the fastest model in the FG Falcon range capable of 0‚Äì100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 4.8s (Reality), excluding the Falcon-based FPV models from Ford Australia's performance vehicle partner Ford Performance Vehicles. The inline- six turbocharged engine has a maximum power of and maximum torque of . The I6 engine has the ability to provide the driver with an overboost feature which engages temporarily when the throttle is fully depressed at speed allowing for up to 324kW for 10-20 seconds and between 586 and 640Nm of torque for a very brief period of time. Both the XR6 and XR6 Turbo can be optioned with the \\"XR Luxury Pack\\", which adds sports leather seats and black carbon look trim inserts, dual zone climate control, 19x8 inch alloy wheels, and premium sound. The \\"Tech pack\\" is also available and adds bluetooth and iPod integration; both option packs add almost all the features from the G6E (minus reversing camera, curtain and side thorax airbags, an 8-way power adjustable driver's seat and memory mirrors, overhead sunglasses holder and mirror indicators) ;Falcon XR8 The XR8 had the same features that are found in the XR6 Turbo. The bulging hood and supporting emblems on the side skirts differentiated it from other XR models. The V8 was taken directly out of the previous model FPV GT with the BOSS290, with a maximum power of and a maximum torque of ; however its performance figures were somewhat less impressive than that of the XR6 Turbo despite having a advantage according to official figures; though it is widely knows that the BOSS290 generates 311kW and 545Nm at the flywheel vs the 295kW/540Nm of the BA/BF BOSS260 figures. It was also less, however, subjectively, agile through corners due to the insignificantly heavier front end. Although slightly slower in some cases, less economical and more expensive than its XR6 Turbo counterpart, it was and still is considered more popular amongst the more traditional Falcon enthusiasts who prefer the sound, feel and the vibe of a naturally aspirated V8 over the inline 6 Turbo, for its sound, off the line performance and overall wider performance envelope vs the Barra270. However, the XR8 sold poorly compared to the XR6 Turbo with the majority of volume being in utility sales. The Falcon XR8 was discontinued in June 2010 as a result of its 5.4-litre engine not complying with the Euro IV emissions standard adopted by Australia at that time. Although initially expected to be re-introduced with the 5.0-litre \\"Coyote\\" engine used in the Ford Mustang GT during 2011, the model was re-introduced in 2014 with the FG-X series Falcon, featuring the 5.0 litre motor. ;G Series Interior, Falcon G6E Up from the XT, this is the base model in the G Series. The G6 is the direct replacement for the Futura. It is powered by the same 4.0L engine and was originally mated to the five-speed automatic (upgraded to the ZF six-speed automatic in 2010). Besides the suspension, which is the sport-luxury tune found in the G6E, the drivetrain of the car is the same as the XT. Equipment levels are increased in the G6. It comes with front fog lights, a leather- wrapped steering wheel with mounted audio controls, rear parking sensors, sports body kit with side skirts and rear bumper, 17-inch alloy wheels. A G6 Limited Edition consisting of just 1500 units, based on the G6. The G6 Limited Edition added leather seats in Shadow, Bluetooth, iPod integration, sports leather-wrapped steering wheel, unique fog lamp bezels, unique front grill (upper and lower), a unique rear bumper insert, side curtain airbags and 18-inch alloy wheels (17-inch on the E-Gas model). The G6E is a step up from the G6, it is the replacement for the old Fairmont Ghia. It includes all of the features of the G6, plus a ZF six-speed automatic transmission, dual zone automatic climate control, a premium audio system, leather seats, Bluetooth mobile phone integration, reversing camera, curtain and side thorax airbags, an 8-way power adjustable driver's seat, 17 x 8-inch 10-spoke alloy wheels, front scuff plates and an overhead sunglass console. It also features Mercedes-Benz styled side indicators on the side mirrors, similar to that on premium European cars. GPS-equipped Ford Falcons (Ford G Series) can warn of traffic incidents via TMC. The G6E Turbo is the same as the G6E, except it has an I6 turbocharged engine, 18 x 8-inch 7-spoke alloy wheels, lower suspension, piano black centre console rather than silver, iPod integration, turbo decals and a boot mounted spoiler. The engine is the same as that found in the XR6 Turbo. From April 2009 production, an update was introduced. This involved an improvement in fuel consumption on six-cylinder models fitted with the optional six-speed automatic. It was also announced that the LPG E-Gas models, like the petrol-powered versions of the FG sedan range, had been awarded the full five-stars in the ANCAP crash safety test. The five-star rating, up from four, was not due to any structural changes to the FG, but by the introduction of electronic stability control (ESC) which was previously only fitted to petrol-powered FG sedans. ESC was also made standard on the E-Gas BF III Falcon wagons still in production (previously unavailable). ESC fitment will be extended to the utility body styles from May 2009, excluding the base XL and R6 Ute, where it will be optional. From June 2010, all sedan models received Bluetooth mobile phone integration and iPod integration as standard equipment.

They included the F6 and V8-powered GT, GT-P and the GT-E variants of the sedan the F6 Ute and V8-powered Pursuit and Super Pursuit models based on the Falcon Ute. The F6 models featured a 4.0L turbocharged DOHC 24-valve in-line six-cylinder engine, which produced a maximum power of at 5,500 rpm and maximum torque of across the range from 1,950 to 5,200 rpm. All other models were powered by a 5.4L Boss V8 engine, which produces at 6,500 rpm and of torque at 4,750 rpm. As of October 2009, FPV released a luxury F6-E model variant, which was equipped the same as a GT-E but with an F6 engine. Also in October 2009, FPV released a GS model to commemorate the historic GS nameplate from the 1970s, which was sold in lieu of a Falcon XR8. It was limited to 250 sedans and 75 utes, and was powered by a detuned V8 from the GT. Its distinguishing exterior features included unique \\"GS\\" decals and dark argent wheels. In October 2010, FPV introduced a supercharged all-alloy DOHC 4 valves per cylinder Coyote \\"Miami\\" V8 engine to replace the older 5.4 L Boss unit. A version was introduced in the FPV GS model (which replaces the defunct XR8 model) and a version was developed for the FPV GT, GT-E, and GT-P models. Limited editions in this series included the GT \\"Black\\", GT \\"R-Spec\\" and, most importantly, the GT-F \\"351\\". These cars had more powerful engines ( for the first two and at 6000 rpm and at 2500-5500 rpm of torque for the GT-F) and both the \\"R-Spec\\" and \\"351\\" also featured an enhanced handling package highlighted by wider 9-inch rear wheels. Furthermore, the dyno testing shows that this engine makes significantly more power than the quoted 315, 335, 345 and 351 kW, figures in excess of 380-400 kW (510-535 hp) at the rear wheels or ~ 520-550 kW (700-735 hp) at the flywheel. They also introduced launch control and the \\"351\\" nomenclature of the GT-F, which has become the \\"F\\"inal GT Falcon ever, represents both its engine output but also pays tribute to the original Falcon GT's cubic inch displacement.

Unlike traditional CMOS circuits, which dissipate energy during switching, adiabatic circuits reduce dissipation by following two key rules: * Never turn on a transistor when there is a voltage potential between the source and drain. * Never turn off a transistor when current is flowing through it. History \\"Adiabatic\\" is a term of Greek origin that has spent most of its history associated with classical thermodynamics. It refers to a system in which a transition occurs without energy (usually in the form of heat) being either lost to or gained from the system. In the context of electronic systems, rather than heat, electronic charge is preserved. Thus, an ideal adiabatic circuit would operate without the loss or gain of electronic charge. The first usage of the term \\"adiabatic\\" in the context of circuitry appears to be traceable back to a paper presented in 1992 at the Second Workshop on Physics and Computation. Although an earlier suggestion of the possibility of energy recovery was made by Charles H. Bennett where in relation to the energy used to perform computation, he stated \\"This energy could in principle be saved and reused\\". Definition Etymology of the term \\"adiabatic logic\\". Because of the second law of thermodynamics, it is not possible to completely convert energy into useful work. However, the term \\"adiabatic logic\\" is used to describe logic families that could theoretically operate without losses. The term \\"quasi-adiabatic logic\\" is used to describe logic that operates with a lower power than static CMOS logic, but which still has some theoretical non-adiabatic losses. In both cases, the nomenclature is used to indicate that these systems are capable of operating with substantially less power dissipation than traditional static CMOS circuits. Principles There are several important principles that are shared by all of these low-power adiabatic systems. These include only turning switches on when there is no potential difference across them, only turning switches off when no current is flowing through them, and using a power supply that is capable of recovering or recycling energy in the form of electric charge. To achieve this, in general, the power supplies of adiabatic logic circuits have used constant current charging (or an approximation thereto), in contrast to more traditional non-adiabatic systems that have generally used constant voltage charging from a fixed-voltage power supply. Power supply The power supplies of adiabatic logic circuits have also used circuit elements capable of storing energy. This is often done using inductors, which store the energy by converting it to magnetic flux. There are a number of synonyms that have been used by other authors to refer to adiabatic logic type systems, these include: \\"charge recovery logic\\", \\"charge recycling logic\\", \\"clock-powered logic\\", \\"energy recovery logic\\" and \\"energy recycling logic\\". Because of the reversibility requirements for a system to be fully adiabatic, most of these synonyms actually refer to, and can be used inter-changeably, to describe quasi-adiabatic systems. These terms are succinct and self-explanatory, so the only term that warrants further explanation is \\"clock-powered logic\\". This has been used because many adiabatic circuits use a combined power supply and clock, or a \\"power-clock\\". This a variable, usually multi-phase, power-supply which controls the operation of the logic by supplying energy to it, and subsequently recovering energy from it. Because high-Q inductors are not available in CMOS, inductors must be off-chip, so adiabatic switching with inductors are limited to designs which use only a few inductors. Quasi- adiabatic stepwise charging avoids inductors entirely by storing recovered energy in capacitors. Stepwise charging (SWC) can use on-chip capacitors. Asynchrobatic logic, introduced in 2004, is a CMOS logic family design style using internal stepwise charging that attempts to combine the low-power benefits of the seemingly contradictory ideas of \\"clock-powered logic\\" (adiabatic circuits) and \\"circuits without clocks\\" (asynchronous circuits).  CMOS adiabatic circuits  There are some classical approaches to reduce the dynamic power such as reducing supply voltage, decreasing physical capacitance and reducing switching activity. These techniques are not fit enough to meet today's power requirement. However, most research has focused on building adiabatic logic, which is a promising design for low power applications. Adiabatic logic works with the concept of switching activities which reduces the power by giving stored energy back to the supply. Thus, the term adiabatic logic is used in low-power VLSI circuits which implements reversible logic. In this, the main design changes are focused in power clock which plays the vital role in the principle of operation. Each phase of the power clock gives user to achieve the two major design rules for the adiabatic circuit design. * Never turn on a transistor if there is a voltage across it (VDS > 0) * Never turn off a transistor if there is a current through it (IDS ‚â† 0) * Never pass current through a diode If these conditions with regard to the inputs, in all the four phases of power clock, recovery phase will restore the energy to the power clock, resulting considerable energy saving. Yet some complexities in adiabatic logic design perpetuate. Two such complexities, for instance, are circuit implementation for time-varying power sources needs to be done and computational implementation by low overhead circuit structures needs to be followed. There are two big challenges of energy recovering circuits; first, slowness in terms of today's standards, second it requires ~50% of more area than conventional CMOS, and simple circuit designs get complicated.

It upholds the view that special allowances do not need to be made by employers for people who want to follow particular religious practices, because people are free to choose their jobs. However, it suggests that employers should give genuine and serious consideration about ways to accommodate their employees requests, even if they cannot ultimately do so. Facts A teacher, Iftikhar Ahmad was a British citizen born in India in 1940 and a Muslim. He had worked at an inner London primary school, run by the Inner London Education Authority, for maladjusted children from 1968 to 1972. He took study leave and, given the opportunity to change schools, he chose one closer to a mosque. The headmaster allowed him extra time to pray on Fridays at lunch break. He then moved again to Chisern School, Bethnal Green, where his job was to do individual reading with children. The headmistress objected to him being away for an extra 50 minutes. He moved again to Bonner Primary School, Bethnal Green. The headmaster there also refused extra time off, and he went anyway. He moved again to Bethnal Green Primary School. Then he moved again to the Roman Catholic primary school in Mile End. Here he took time off in spite of being told not to. He was told he could take part-time teaching, but he refused and instead he resigned. At this time part-time jobs were not protected by equal pay laws, and often, part-time contracts were paid less per hour than full- time ones. At tribunal, Dr Pasha said Friday prayer was so important that in Saudi Arabia, three times not attending leads to beheading. One of the main questions was whether under Article 9 ECHR (the right to freedom of religion and conscience) the school ought to have given Mr Ahmad the time off. JudgmentCourt of Appeal= The Court of Appeal (Scarman LJ dissenting) dismissed the case.[1978] QB 38 Lord Denning MR held, > The convention is not part of our English law, but, as I have often said, we > will always have regard to it. We will do our best to see that our decisions > are in conformity with it.

Scarman LJ said there was a duty to accommodate devout Muslims, even if it involved additional cost, because Art.9 required the right of worship to be unimpeded. =European Commission= The European Commission of Human Rights held that there was not even interference with his freedom of religion under Art.9(1) (at 23). Freedom of religion is not absolute and 'it may as regards the modality of a particular religious manifestation, be influenced by the situation of the person claiming that freedom' (para 11). It also noted that United Kingdom society was with its increasing Muslim community in a period of transition.' But they also made the point that there was no failure to consider better working arrangements.

The Court of Appeal decided that it was irrelevant whether someone was gay or not or the bullies believe the person is gay or not, if the harassment has sexuality as its focus. Facts Stephen English, who lived in Brighton, was a heterosexual married man with three children who worked for Thomas Sanderson Ltd between 1996 and August 2005, when he left voluntarily. He went to an Employment Tribunal, claiming harassment in the workplace under section 5 of the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003, alleging that he had been the subject of homophobic mockery, but the tribunal rejected his claim because he admitted that none of his work colleagues had actually thought he was gay. He was represented by Frederic Reynold QC.English v Sanderson Blinds Ltd (2008) EWCA Civ 1421 at bailii.org, accessed 17 November 2016 JudgmentEmployment Appeal Tribunal= At the Employment Appeal Tribunal, Peter-Clark J held he was not persuaded any material difference existed between the \\"on grounds\\" provisions in the Sex Discrimination Act and the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003. He held the Regulations do not properly implement the Directive (at 21), as was held by Burton J in EOC v. SS for Trade and Industry [2007] IRLR 327. So people should be allowed to claim even when they are not themselves gay. However, he then said that the claimant‚Äôs difficulty was that nobody thought he was gay (at 23), so that the harassment was not on grounds of sexual orientation at all. It was a ‚Äòvehicle for teasing the Claimant‚Äô (at 24). He then said ‚Äòwithout deciding the point, that the result may have been different on direct application of the Directive‚Äô. =Court of Appeal= The Court of Appeal by a majority applied the Directive directly, overturning the EAT's decision. Laws LJ gave the first judgment, and dissented, saying there was no harassment under regulation 5.

It was founded by Birtukan Midekssa on June 20, 2008, based on the parties that constituted the Coalition for Unity and Democracy. It was a major component in the eight-party Medrek coalition, the largest opposition coalition in the 2010 election. In May 2019, the party merged with the Ethiopian Citizens for Social Justice, bringing an end to the party.  Overview  The Unity for Democracy and Justice Party (UDJP), commonly known as Andenet (Amharic for Unity), is an Ethiopian national opposition political party established by former leaders and members of Coalition for Unity and Democracy Party (CUD). Andenet is a short form of UDJP's Amharic name, Andenet ledemocracy ena lefitih. It was formed by former CUD leaders and members advocating for free and fair Ethiopian elections in the then-upcoming 2010 elections. The UDJP was chaired and vice-chaired by Birtukan Midekssa and Yakob Haile-Mariam, respectively. Both were detained and sentenced to life in prison before they were controversially pardoned on October 6, 2008 and September 2007, respectively. Their arrests were considered by Ethiopian political opposition parties as a Majority Government attempt to block fair and free election and democratic process.

Their services improve the quality of life for veterans and their families and reduce potential factors that contribute to veteran suicide. The non-profit organization receives hundreds of aid requests per week and assists these emergencies with thousands of dollars weekly. To date, USA Cares has responded to over 100,000 requests for financial help with millions of dollars in granted assistance. In addition to individual donations, USA Cares has received support from several major foundations and corporations worldwide. According to USA Cares' official website, \\"84.27% of every dollar contributed was applied directly to support veterans and their loved ones.\\" Veteran and Military Family Assistance Programs: * Combat Injured Assistance: This program pays necessary expenses for veterans diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and military sexual trauma (MST) while they receive treatment. * Emergency Assistance: This program assists veterans, service members, and military families who are facing temporary financial hardship and unable to pay bills essential to their health and well-being. Clients receiving support in this program are required to participate in a Financial Planning Education Course. * Housing Assistance: When bills are past due as a result of a military service-related incident, USA Cares directly pays the landlord or mortgage lender to reduce any extra financial burdens from the veteran, service member, or their family. * Career Transition: This program provides service members, veterans, and their spouses with tools and resources to better prepare them for the hiring process and refers qualified candidates to corporate organizations with open positions of employment specific to their skill sets. Additionally, this program helps pay an individual‚Äôs essential expenses while they train for a new job or career. Additional Programs: * Senior Leaders Corporate Fellowship Program: In coordination with Fort Knox ACES, Fort Knox SFL-TAP, and USA Cares' Career Transition Program, this program provides skills development training for those preparing for the transition from military service into the civilian workforce. Through this program, each participant will have the opportunity to participate in a fellowship at a local organization within the Kentuckiana region. * USA Cares Certified Military Housing Specialist Course: A nationally certified course designed to provide loan officers, realtors and housing professionals with a clear understanding of how to work with military borrowers, whether they‚Äôre using a VA loan or other type of financing. This course helps housing professionals make sense of the military language, rank and pay system, delivering the tools and knowledge necessary to provide prompt and competitive service to military borrowers in a timely and competitive manner, especially in a fast-paced market. It also includes advice regarding foreclosure prevention, with tips that loan officers and realtors can give their clients to help them avoid mortgage delinquencies in the future. * Military Family Financial Education & Empowerment Program: As part of the application process, USA Cares incorporates a brief financial education course to provide support to military families who are facing a financial hardship to better to arm military families with the tools they need to be prepared when the unexpected or expected happens. History: USA Cares is committed to its mission to provide financial and advocacy assistance to post-9/11 active duty U.S. military service personnel, veterans and their families. USA Cares was launched through a grassroots partnership between WAVE-3 TV in Louisville, KY, the Mid-South Division of Kroger Food Stores, and the Association of the United States Army Fort Knox Chapter. The organization was dubbed Kentuckiana Cares, with a goal to raise funds to help military families in financial crisis through the sale of ‚ÄúSupport Our Troops‚Äù yard signs. In October 2003, in response to the increasing number of requests for assistance, Kentuckiana Cares evolved into what is now USA Cares, a 501(c)(3) national non-profit organization that has assisted thousands of veterans and military families facing hardships related to service. USA Cares' goal is to help restore financial stability and self-sufficiency to post-9/11 veterans and military families by giving them ‚Äúa hand up.‚Äù The organization strives to reach families at the earliest stage of intervention to prevent further financial distress and suffering, especially for the combat injured and their families. USA Cares takes a ‚Äúholistic‚Äù approach to helping active military service members, veterans and their families. All services are free and applications for assistance are accepted 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Immediacy is key; once an application for aid is processed and eligibility is determined, USA Cares is able to provide financial assistance within 48 hours. All requests are verified through a thorough documentation process. Financial assistance is not given directly to service members or their families; instead, payments are made to mortgage lenders, utility companies, and other vendors. Each family approved for assistance is assigned an advocate from USA Cares' Family Resource Center who ensures that any assistance provided is timely and effective. These advocates often mobilize additional support for families from other military assistance organizations as well as those in the service member‚Äôs local community. When USA Cares receives a request for assistance, they respond to the applicant and can have a payment made within 48 hours. While many other military assistance programs provide loans which only compound a bad situation, USA Cares provides grants. The military family is never asked to pay the grant back.

Preparation Chiraphos is prepared from S,S or R,R-2,3-butanediol, which are derived from commercially available S,S or R,R-tartaric acid; the technique of using cheaply available enantiopure starting materials is known as chiral pool synthesis. The diol is tosylated and then the ditosylate is treated with lithium diphenylphosphide.

It was alleged, and found, that they were incompatible with the Framework Directive, 2000/73/EC. Facts The Equal Opportunities Commission applied for judicial review of the Employment Equality (Sex Discrimination) Regulations 2005 introduced by the defendant secretary of state. The Regulations had made amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 in order to implement Directive 2002/73. The commission argued that the amendments did not properly implement the Directive because, *(1) the new s 4A(1) of the Act impermissibly imported causation into the concept of harassment by the words \\"on the grounds of her sex\\"; *(2) the new s 4A(1) wrongly required that the unwanted conduct had to be by reason of, or on the ground of, the complainant's sex; *(3) the new s 4A(2) inappropriately imported an objective test into the definition of harassment; *(4) they had failed to introduce liability on employers for discrimination by third parties; *(5) they had impermissibly introduced the requirement for a comparator for the purpose of establishing discrimination on grounds of pregnancy, and that as it was not intended that there would still be a remedy for a woman complaining of discrimination by reference to pregnancy or maternity leave under s 1 of the Act in parallel with the new right under s. 3A of the Act, the new section would offend against the principle of regression because it would reduce the protection previously available; *(6) the new s 6A(7) excluded a claim for discrimination during compulsory maternity leave that the complainant had been deprived of a discretionary bonus and s 6A(3) and s 6A(4) placed a substantial limit on discrimination claims that could be made in respect of the additional maternity leave period. Judgment Judge Burton upheld the complaints and granted the application. :(1) It was the court's duty to construe statutes and regulations passed by Member States so as to render them compliant with a relevant Directive. However, in the instant case it was not appropriate to do so because of the degree of reading down or transposition that would be required to render the provisions compliant with the Directive, or it was not possible to do so because such extreme application of the requirement to interpret national legislation in accordance with Directives would not be effective or sensible because of the need for clarity, certainty and comprehensibility. Section 4A(1)(a) should be recast so as to eliminate the issue of causation, R. (on the application of Amicus) v. Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [2004] EWHC 860 (Admin), [2007] I.C.R. 1176 considered. :(2) There could be harassment of a woman if the effect of denigratory conduct, directed towards another party, not necessarily a woman, related to sex, but not of a sexual nature, had the effect of creating a humiliating or offensive environment for her. The new s. 4A(1) would have to be read down to produce that result and accordingly should be amended. :(3) Under the law of discrimination prior to the introduction of s. 4A of the Act the test was properly to be regarded as objective, Driskel v. Peninsula Business Services Ltd [2000] IRLR 151 EAT applied. Therefore, no issue of regression arose. :(4) So long as s. 4A was framed in terms of unwanted conduct engaged in \\"on the ground of her sex\\" by the employer, it was difficult, if not impossible, to see how an employer could be held liable for knowing failure to take steps to prevent harassment by third parties that created an offensive working environment for employees. Section 4A(1) should be recast to allow for such a claim. :(5) Section 3A should be recast so as to eliminate the statutory requirement for a comparator who was not pregnant or who was not on maternity leave. :(6) Section 6A should be recast so as to provide that discrimination claims that had previously been available should not be excluded, Lewen v Denda (C333/97) [2000] All E.R. (EC) 261 ECJ (6th Chamber) and Land Brandenburg v. Sass (C-284/02) [2004] ECR. I-11143 ECJ (1st Chamber) applied.

Background and education Tomb of two Sir Edwards Littleton, father and grandfather of the first baronet, at St Michael's Church Penkridge. Lower stage: Sir Edward Littleton (d. 1610) and his wife, Margaret Devereux. Upper stage: Sir Edward (d. 1629), and his wife, Mary Fisher. Edward Littleton was born in 1599 or 1598: he was recorded as 18 years of age when he enrolled at Oxford University in 1617.Foster. Alumni Oxonienses, volume 3, p. 919. He was the son of Sir Edward Littleton of Pillaton Hall, near Penkridge, Staffordshire and Mary Fisher, daughter of Clement Fisher of Packington, Warwickshire. Both of Littleton's parents came from the middling landed gentry. His mother, Mary, came from the neighbouring county of Warwickshire, where the Fishers held the manor of Packington in chiefSalzman. History of the County of Warwick, volume 4, Parishes: Great Packington: Manor, note anchor 21. and the advowson of the parish church.Salzman. History of the County of Warwick, volume 4, Parishes: Great Packington: Advowson, note anchor 39. Clement, her father, had succeeded to his lands in 1571 and died on 23 October 1619, leaving as heir his son Sir Robert.Salzman. History of the County of Warwick, volume 4, Parishes: Great Packington: Manor, note anchors 23-5. However, his widow, also Mary, continued to occupy the manor house with her other daughter Anne Dilke. It seems that there was considerable family tension, not least because Clement's widow soon died, making at difficult for Sir Robert to get the will executed. In 1621 he accused his deceased mother and widowed sister of wasting timber on the estateSalzman. History of the County of Warwick, volume 4, Parishes: Great Packington: Manor, note anchors 26. and received letters of administration only in May 1623. There had already been a succession of four Edwards Littleton at Pillaton Hall and there were to be many more in the Shropshire branch of the family. The first baronet is easily confused with these, and also with Edward Littleton, 1st Baron Lyttelton, one of the Shropshire branch of the family, who was an older contemporary and frequently in attendance at Parliament at the same time. The Littletons of Staffordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire were all alike descendants of Thomas de Littleton, an eminent 15th century judge and jurist. The spelling of the name has now been regularised but numerous variants were current in the 16th and 17th centuries and the various branches of the family were not distinguished orthographically. The Staffordshire Littletons had often been turbulent, like their Worcestershire cousins. Edward Littleton's paternal grandfather had been a prominent supporter of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, marrying the earl's cousin, and had been arrested and temporarily disgraced as a suspected organiser of the Essex Rebellion. His father was suspected of Puritan sympathies and had supported a controversial minister at St Michael's Church in Penkridge, where the Littletons held the advowson.Midgley. History of the County of Stafford, vol. 5, Penkridge: Penkridge: Economic history, churches, schools and charities, note anchor 162. He too kept up the Devereux connection: Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex had a seat at nearby Chartley Castle and was a powerful ally, as well as a relative. The young Edward was sent off to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 28 March 1617. His county was recorded as Warwickshire, which was his mother's native place. This may reflect the family's financial plight. About three years earlier his father, a liberal and generous host, had run into financial difficulties in the wake of his term as Sheriff of the county and had moved his household to Worcester to economise. Young Edward was admitted to the Inner Temple, the Inn of Court attended by his recent ancestors, little more than a year later, on 13 June 1618.The Inner Temple Admissions Database, record 12268. Nothing further is recorded of his legal studies, although his kinsmen the Shropshire Littletons were moving into a period of great influence at the Inner Temple.Inderwick, p. xcvi-xcvii. His education was probably intended simply to give him the rudiments required for the life of a member of the county landed gentry. This was in sharp contrast to the distinguished academic career of his younger brother, Walter,Foster. Alumni Oxonienses, volume 3, p. 920. who had no expectation of inheriting large estates. It seems that the Littleton family returned to Pillaton soon after Edward's admission to the Inner Temple, perhaps during 1618, and their financial situation began to recover as a result of a switch to demesne farming and animal husbandry. Marriage and honours It seems that the now wealthy family were now able to purchase a knighthood once the young Edward reached maturity and he received it on 22 August 1621 at Warwick.Shaw, p. 177. In 1625 he married Hester Courten or Courteen, daughter of Sir William Courten, an immensely wealthy London textile merchant and financier, originally from Menen in Flanders. Courten had lent ¬£25,000 to the Crown.Wedgwood, p. 61. Keen to place his children advantageously, he paid a dowry of ¬£5000 to the Littletons, who were only middling gentry. Courten married his other daughter Anne to Essex Devereux, a kinsman of the Earl of Essex, thus strengthening the Devereux/Littleton connection. After the untimely death of Essex Devereux, Anne was married to Edward Littleton's cousin and trustee, Richard Knightley. It is likely that it was the huge dowry from Courten that made possible the purchase of a baronetcy for the younger Edward Littleton, which was conferred by Charles I on 28 June 1627.Cokayne, Complete baronetage, Volume 2, p. 27. Ship money After succeeding his father, Littleton began to play a full part in the political life of his county. He served as High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1636 ‚Äì 37. His shrievalty coincided with the ship money crisis and he seems to have held an ambivalent position, allowing many to escape without paying.Wedgwood, p. 58-9. On 12 February 1637 he wrote from Pillaton to Edward Nicholas, clerk to the Privy Council complaining that he had :found such refractoriness in most of the county, as well constables, assessors, and others, by reason of the ¬£1,000 that is laid on the county more than the first time, that they say they will petition and not pay till they be answered. Should he bind them all up it would never be ended. He has been very rough with many, and now they begin a little to be reclaimed. Were he to suffer death for his neglect he were not able to do more. Cannot as yet get a quarter of the assessments to be signed, directing daily warrants out to the high constables for their answering their contempt at the Council table. As soon as he can force them he will return an account. Whole regiments come daily to his house saying, \\"Distrain !\\" for they have no money. Did Nicholas know the charge he is at, and the trouble, he would plead for the writer and the Lords compassionate him. He has received ¬£650 and given order to his undersheriff, Mr. Richard, to pay in ¬£1,000.Calendar of State Papers, 1636‚Äì7, p. 439. A month later he wrote again in a similar vein, pointing out that some had overpaid while the constable of Seisdon Hundred had neither paid in any money nor submitted any accounts.Calendar of State Papers, 1636‚Äì7, p. 493. At some stage, presumably later in the year, Littleton was faced by a summons to the House of Lords over ¬£300 arrears, against ¬£2700 paid in, and petitioned for a stay until Easter 1638 to give him a chance to complete the collection.Calendar of State Papers, 1637‚Äì8, p. 90. Although Littleton had sought to portray himself as zealous in collecting money for the king but frustrated by inefficient constables, Sir John Skeffington, his successor as sheriff, gave a very different picture in a letter to Nicholas from his Staffordshire home at Fisherwick. :Being at Skeffington in Leicestershire on receipt of the writs for ship-money, he has transplanted himself for the better performance of his duty, and having sought conference with the head constables and others, whether from jealousy that he would not give them the same connivance as his predecessors, whereby a great part of the collection is yet ungathered, or from what other reasons he cannot guess, he received from them directions which would have led him into error and there kept him if he had not redeemed himself.Calendar of State Papers, 1637, p. 532. Wedgwood thought this indicated that \\"Sir Edward was even then on the popular side.\\" However, blaming a predecessor seems a natural enough tactic and the two men were equally keen to cast as much as possible of the blame on subordinates. The latter tactic was at least partly successful. As late as 31 May 1640 the Privy Council was still pursuing the constables who had been cited as dishonest or slipshod by Littleton.Calendar of State Papers, 1640, p. 250. Drift to conflict Memorial to Sir Richard Leveson (1598-1661) and his wife Katherine Dudley. St Michael's church, Lilleshall, Shropshire. Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, a kinsman and ally of Littleton. Littleton was Member of Parliament for Staffordshire from 1640, in both the Short Parliament and the Long Parliament. Initially a trusted Parliamentarian, he was entrusted with his share of commissions and committees. On 26 March 1641 he was appointed to a committee on a bill described as being \\"to prevent Dangers, that may happen by Popish Recusants.\\"House of Commons Journal, volume 2, 26 March 1641 pm. Not surprisingly, in May he agreed to the terms of the Protestation that he would \\"promise, vow, and protest, to maintain and defend, as far as lawfully I may, with my Life, Power, and Estate, the true, reformed, Protestant Religion...\\"House of Commons Journal, volume 2, 3 May 1641 pm. In August the MPs for various counties were commissioned to put into effect an act for the disarming of recusants, yet to be drawn up: Littleton and his friend Sir Richard Leveson received the commission as Staffordshire MPs.House of Commons Journal, volume 2, 21 August 1641. As the country drifted towards war, Littleton remained a resolute Parliamentarian. On 6 June 1642 he wrote to Leveson, an MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme,Wedgwood, p. 31. pointing out that Parliament expected all members to be in attendance by 16 June, with a penalty of ¬£100 for non-compliance ‚Äì to be used in funding the war in Ireland. He then reported on the king's preparations for civil war, including his commissions to raise troops against Parliament in every county.Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts. Fifth Report, part 1, p. 141. Leveson failed to commit himself to Parliament and was summoned by the House of Commons in August. However, when the king's Commission of array wrote urging him to mobilise on the royalist side he joined with other local gentry in signing a refusal \\"without supreme authority or greater motives of more demonstrable dangers to raise the armes of their county.\\" Ultimately Leveson's neutralist policy failed in the face of the king's order to suppress all third Force troops, and he reluctantly took up the royalist cause.Coulton, p. 94. Littleton, on the other hand, did not vacillate but immediately rallied to Parliament. A week after he wrote to Leveson, he was back at Parliament, where he was ordered, along with two other MPs, to notify his father-in-law Courten that he must not sell or move his stocks of saltpetre, an essential component of gunpowder, which Parliament intended to buy from him.House of Commons Journal, volume 2, 13 June 1642. On 6 August the king, then at York, appointed Littleton Custos Rotulorum of Staffordshire, to replace Essex, who was Lord Lieutenant of the county and a leader of the opposition among the Lords. If this was intended to loosen the Devereux-Littleton connection,Wedgwood, p. 59. it failed. Active for Parliament Lord Brooke, lord of Penkridge manor, from an engraving by William Henry Mote. By February 1643 the royalists were dominant across most of Staffordshire.Sherwood, p. 24. Parliament's counter-attack was launched under Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke, lord of the manor of Penkridge, and as such a neighbour of Littleton,Midgley. History of the County of Stafford, vol. 5, Penkridge: Introduction and manors, note anchor 186. although he had substantial holdings around Warwick. Brooke took Stratford upon Avon and on 2 March, St Chad‚Äôs Day, invested the cathedral close at Lichfield, which had been fortified by the royalists. He was killed on the first day of the siege by a sniper but the garrison capitulated on 5 March.Sherwood, p. 32. On 14 March the Commons considered a letter from the successful soldiers at Lichfield, which included a request for money and saddles. Littleton and another MP were ordered to write a letter of thanks from the House.House of Commons Journal, volume 2, 14 March 1643. Four days later the House committed to his care and that of a Lancashire MP some captured saddles, to be shared between troops in their respective counties.House of Commons Journal, volume 3, 18 March 1643. On 27 March Littleton was commissioned, along with other MPs from his county, to enforce a law providing for the sequestration of the estates of \\"notorious delinquents,\\" i.e. royalists.Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660. March 1643: An Ordinance for sequestring notorious Delinquents Estates. On 7 May he was similarly nominated to enforce an emergency financial measure, \\"An Ordinance for the speedy raising and levying of money thorowout the whole Kingdome of England, and dominion of Wales for the relief of the Common-wealth...\\"Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660. May 1643: An Ordinance for the speedy raising and levying of money thorowout the whole Kingdome of England, and dominion of Wales for the relief of the Common-wealth, by taxing such as have not at all contributed or lent, or not according to their Estates and Abilities. On 6 June he was listed among those MPs who took the Covenant, expressing their willingness to continue the war in defence of the Protestant faith.House of Commons Journal, volume 3, 6 June 1643. On 3 August he was nominated again in connection with another \\"Ordinance for the speedy Raising and Levying of Money.\\"Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660. August 1643: An Ordinance for the speedy Raising and Levying of Money, for the Maintenance of the Army raised by the Parliament, and other great Affairs of the Commonwealth. As late as 20 August he was appointed to the committee dealing with MPs who deserted Parliament. Defection The 2nd Earl of Denbigh. However, by 15 November 1643 Parliament was fruitlessly summoning Littleton back from leave of absence.House of Commons Journal, volume 3, 15 November 1643. By 2 December the tone had become insistent, as Parliament ordered: \\"That Sir Edw. Littleton be summoned to attend the Service of the House forthwith.\\"House of Commons Journal, volume 3, 2 December 1643. In January 1644 he joined the Oxford ParliamentWedgwood, p. 60. and on 4 March was disabled from attending Westminster, together with Sir John Borlase, 1st Baronet, \\"for neglecting the Service of the House, and going to the other Party.\\"House of Commons Journal, volume 3, 4 March 1644. However, it was not until 31 July 1646 that the writ was moved for by-elections to replace both Littleton and Sir Hervey Bagot, a committed royalist disabled as early as 24 November 1642,Wedgwood, p. 54. as Staffordshire MPs. Some details of Littleton's defection came to light in December 1649, during an investigation into allegations that Basil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh, the Parliamentarian commander in the Midlands at the time, had been implicated in moves to create a third force or a large scale defection to the king. These grew out of long feud between Denbigh and the Shropshire parliamentary committee, whose leader Humphrey Mackworth, had discovered Denbigh was in contact with a royalist agent in December 1643.Calendar of State Papers, 1649‚Äì1650, p. 445, no. 104. This came to light through the investigations of John Swinfen, a Staffordshire Presbyterian who later represented Stafford in the Long Parliament, and a Captain Stone. Denbigh himself admitted to Mackworth that a Captain Gower, who had travelled widely with him, had been encouraging him to go over to the king and that his defection would be accompanied by a royalist rising in Huntingdonshire. Littleton had announced in Staffordshire that he was raising forces on Denbigh's behalf, apparently in order to launch a third party, with the help of Sir Walter Wrottesley and Gerard Scrimshaw of Aqualate Hall. Swinfen, a member of the Staffordshire parliamentary committee, had warned that Littleton had made his peace with the king, precipitating his flight to Oxford. Correspondence between Littleton and Denbigh was said to cast serious suspicion on the Earl, who nevertheless survived this investigation, as several others, and never actually deserted Parliament. Isolated from his Staffordshire base, Littleton was impotent to contribute to the royalist cause in the area, and parliamentary soldiers occupied Penkridge in 1645 after the briefest of skirmishes.Midgley. History of the County of Stafford, vol. 5, Penkridge: Introduction and manors, note anchor 98. He served to the bitter end of hostilities in the Midlands: the siege of Worcester, which began on 21 May 1646 and ended on 23 July.Sherwood, p. 158.] Littleton heads the list of knights present in the garrison at the end of the siege.Calendar of State Papers, 1645‚Äì1647, p. 456. Sequestration Littleton's estates were subject to sequestration and forfeiture. As early as 25 June 1646, even before he surrendered at Worcester, Parliament granted one of his small estates, Little Saredon, to a local minister.House of Commons Journal, volume 4, 25 June 1646. He was listed as a delinquent in a report from the Staffordshire sequestrations solicitors to the Committee for Compounding with Delinquents in March 1648.Calendar of the Proceedings of the Committee for Compounding, volume 1, p. 89. The complexity of some of the financial transactions in which he was involved, mainly through the dealings of the Courtens, gradually became apparent.House of Commons Journal, volume 5, 21 December 1647. Littleton applied to compound but this was impossible because of the complications caused by his own personal debt of ¬£3000 and the surety for the vast sum of ¬£50,000 he had stood for his father- in-law and brother-in-law. This he noted in an application he made on 11 June 1649 to avoid any accusation of contempt for not compounding by the due date.Calendar of the Proceedings of the Committee for Compounding, volume 3, p. 2080-1. The committee accepted his explanation but he remained unable to compound because of his debts. CokayneCokayne. Complete baronetage, Volume 2, p. 28. probably depending on Kimber and Johnson,Kimber and Johnson. Baronetage of England, p. 293. asserts that Littleton ultimately compounded for his estates and gives the fine as ¬£1347 6s. 8d. Wedgwood thought that \\"on 10 December 1649 he had been fined ¬£1134, and sequestration had been suspended on payment of half.\\" This seems to be a misreading of Mary Anne Everett Green‚Äôs calendar of the committee proceedings, which show this as the sum demanded of Sir Edward's brother, Fisher, on 10 December 1650 to redeem parts of the estate he was then claiming. Sir Edward's failure to compound is asserted by the History of Parliament in a biography of his son and successor, which cites Green's calendar as evidence. Various creditors had claimed parts of his estates but on 13 June 1650 tenants were ordered not to pay any rent to extenders, i.e. temporary exploiters, of his estates but to pay it directly to the local sequestrations committee at Stafford.Calendar of the Proceedings of the Committee for Compounding, volume 1, p. 249-50. On 1 August 1650 the Commons passed an act that allowed creditors and mortgagees to pay a portion of the delinquent's fine relating to the lands they claimed and thus gain possession.Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660. August 1650: An Act concerning Mortgages, Extents, &c.; upon Delinquents Estates. By the end of the month there was a series of applications to consider from people with claims on the estates to compound for their portions.Calendar of the Proceedings of the Committee for Compounding, volume 3, p. 2081. One of these was Anne Gates, widow of Thomas Gates, a Parliamentarian and Baron of the Exchequer, who had died as recently as 19 August,Foss, p. 433-4. and who had been renting half of Littleton's Worcestershire estates from the sequestrator. Then came Francis Neville, also renting Worcestershire estates, who was owed ¬£800 by Littleton but had so far made only ¬£80 towards clearing the debt. Sir William Hicks claimed that he had received only ¬£800 towards a debt of ¬£1800, outstanding since 1643. These made progress towards their desired goals at varying rates over the next two years. Fisher Littleton, Sir Edward's brother and trustee, sought to rescue some parts of the estates by buying them back for the family, claiming that he was one of Sir Edward's major creditors, with a judgement against him amounting to ¬£1600, dating back to 1643.Calendar of the Proceedings of the Committee for Compounding, volume 3, p. 2082. Fisher had been renting a large portfolio of his brother's land, half of all his Staffordshire estates, since 1646 for ¬£100 a year, although it was worth ¬£245. On 10 December 1650 the committee offered him the land for a fine of ¬£1134, with half to be paid immediately and the rest within six weeks. Within two days Fisher had deposited the first installment and provided security for the remainder, so the sequestration on this land was suspended. On 1 October 1650 the Commons debated a resolution from the army committee intended to expedite cases where landowners had tried to conceal the extent and value of their holdings. It was proposed that they might own up and save these lands, although they would be expected to pay a sixth, rather than a tenth, for them.House of Commons Journal, volume 6, 1 October 1647. The resolution was passed the following day and the Littletons sought to take advantage of it. This was one of a number of cases where a \\"discoverer\\" or informer had already sought to reveal the facts and make a profit by so doing.Calendar of the Proceedings of the Committee for Compounding, volume 5, p. xxviii. One Humphrey Lewis protested that he had reported a subterfuge by which Sir William Hicks and Fisher Littleton sought to protect some of Sir Edward's land by making false claims to it. As Lewis had done this in April 1650, he contended that he was the first discoverer and a subsequent admission by Fisher Littleton did not count. The Staffordshire parliamentary committee issued a certificate recognising Lewis's claim in December 1650 but the Committee for Compounding did not consider the matter until 17 March 1652. Two days later it accepted Lewis's claim, awarding him a fifth of the profits from the estate.Calendar of the Proceedings of the Committee for Compounding, volume 5, p. 3293. Meanwhile, other creditors were pushing forward their claims. In May 1652 Thomas Kempson sought confirmation of his tenancy of the tithes of Great Saredon, which Littleton had transferred to him in settlement of a debt. In this case the county committee frustrated his efforts. In November 1652 the Commons debated a bill authorising the sale of the remaining lands of delinquents with the aim of paying off their debts. Littleton petitioned for his name to be included and the House agreed.House of Commons Journal, volume 7, 2 November 1652. He was duly included in the resulting act.Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660. November 1652: An Additional Act for Sale of several Lands and Estates forfeited to the Commonwealth for Treason. Fisher Littleton continued to buy back the family estates and agitated for the more rapid release of land for this purpose: on 30 June 1653 the Council of State referred to committee a petition on this subject he had submitted.Calendar of State Papers, 1652‚Äì1653, p. 455. The following month Littleton's trustees, his cousin Richard Knightley and nephew Richard Salwey, were able to get the lordship of Shelsley Walsh in Worcestershire released from sequestration. They seem to have transferred it soon to Sir Edward, as he, his wife and his heir sold to Thomas Foley in 1654.Page, Willis Bund. History of the County of Worcester, vol. 4, Parishes: Shelsley Walsh: Manor, note anchor 48-9. The indefatigable Fisher Littleton had, in September 1653, recovered a number of Staffordshire estates, including the lands of the former Penkridge College. Death Littleton is thought to have been buried at St Edward the Confessor Church, Romford on 3 August 1657.Wedgwood, p. 61. Family As noted above, Sir Edward Littleton married Hester Courten, daughter of a rich merchant and financier. They had three sons of whom two, James and William, died sine prole. Sir Edward's surviving son and successor was Sir Edward Littleton, 2nd Baronet. There were also two daughters, Anne, the second wife of Sir Thomas Holte, who remarried Charles Leigh after Holte' death, and Margaret.

Career Blanc is one of the most experienced sport's marketing executives in Europe having led organizations in different major sports over the last 20 years; indeed he managed the Olympics (winter games), the Tour de France (cycling), the Paris Dakar (motoracing), the French Open (tennis), Davis Cup and has been the Chairman and CEO of Juventus Football Club. Between 1987 and 1992 Blanc was Sales and Marketing / Opening and Closing Ceremony Director for the Albertville Olympic Games in France and worked very close to Jean-Claude KILLY, chairman of the Organizing Committee. He then became the CEO between 1994 and 2000 (after taking his MBA at Harvard) of Amaury Sport Organization (ASO), a branch of a media company owning and operating the main sporting events in France in cycling, motoracing and athletics (Tour de France, Paris/Roubaix, Paris/Dakar race, Paris Marathon...). JCB boosted ASO's revenues and international reach as well as created an all news TV network / L'Equipe TV. Between 2001 and June 2006 he was nominated CEO of the French Tennis Association and as such was the manager in charge of organizing the French Open (Roland Garros), the Paris Master Series and the Davis Cup / Fed Cup tennis events when staged in France. During his tenure, the French Open reached a new level of development and success thanks to JCB's innovative ideas like adding an extra week-end of grand Slam tennis by starting the tournament on a Sunday instead of a Monday. Before becoming Chairman of the Board of Juventus Football Club in October 2009, Blanc was brought in as a board member during the club's worst period in history when it was relegated to the second division (Serie B) due to the Calciopoli scandal.

Facts Some male co-workers at Strathclyde Regional Council made sexually abusive comments to a Ms Porcelli. Employers are under a duty of care for their employees, so the law deems them to be vicariously liable for the other employees. Ms Porcelli sued the council for sexual discrimination. The council argued that really, the comments were not about sex discrimination, and although they used certain sexually charged terms, really it was just general abuse because they did not like her. Judgment Lord Emmerslie held that even though the abuse was motivated by not liking her rather than being sexist, it was still different treatment on grounds of sex (this was before a self-standing harassment provision). The sexual language was a \\"sexual sword\\", and therefore had to be included in the scope of the provisions combatting sex discrimination. See also *Robichaud v.

In particular it was asked whether the exceptions created for churches and religious groups, being allowed to exclude gay people from employment was legitimate (r.7(3)). Judgment Richards J held that the implementation was adequate, though it was stressed that the exceptions would be tightly construed. First, the genuine occupational requirements could apply where the employers were not satisfied an applicant met its requirements, as well as where they did not in fact. Second, it was rejected that a church group under r 7(3) could dismiss a gay cleaner, dismiss a science teacher for being a lesbian or not employ a gay person at a bookshop with holy scripts, even though people may have strong convictions. Nor could a Muslim group refuse a librarian post to someone appearing to be gay. It was ‚Äòclear from the Parliamentary material that the exception was intended to be very narrow; and‚Ä¶ is on its proper construction, very narrow.‚Äô That so, because it is a derogation from the equal treatment principle.

She cares for her invalid sister who needs an expensive operation to save her life, so she appeals to her employer who agrees to give her the money only if she will give herself to him sexually. Having no choice, she reluctantly agrees to move in with him; however, three months later, her sister dies and she realizes her sacrifice was all for naught. Olga leaves the attorney and is befriended by the Rev. John Armstrong, who brings her to live with his mother. Their friendship blossoms into love and she and the reverend eventually marry. One year later, the town is embroiled in a controversy when the local theatre shows a silent movie entitled \\"Shall We Forgive Her?\\", which depicts a woman's story very similar to Olga's. Deacon Jellice wants the picture banned and a lawyer is called in to arbitrate. The lawyer turns out to be Stephen Leslie, who sees Olga and threatens to expose her past transgressions if she does not move back into his home and be his mistress once again. Olga plans to run away from both men this time, and leaves a written confession for Reverend John to find, but on her way out of town, she chances to enter the theatre where the film is playing. She is moved by the story so similar to her own, and the film ends with the title \\"Judge Not Lest Ye Be Judged\\". Leslie also sees the movie and becomes repentant.

The film stars Salman Khan and Ajay Devgn in the lead roles while Asin plays the female lead and Rannvijay Singh, Om Puri, and newcomer Aditya Roy Kapur are featured in supporting roles. The film had a worldwide release on 30 October 2009 and was a critical and commercial failure. It marks the second collaboration between Khan and Devgn after Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999). Plot The story revolves around two childhood friends, Arjun (played by Ajay Devgn) and Mannu (played by Salman Khan). When Arjun was 17 years old, he was more focused on becoming a singer but his father disagreed therefore he began praying for his death so he can go to London. The only one who consoled him was his 15 years old friend Mannu. After Arjun's father dies, he finally travels to London with his uncle (Om Puri) whom he later runs away from after arriving. Arjun, now 35 years old creates a fledgling band with Zoheb and Wasim (Rannvijay Singh and Aditya Roy Kapoor, respectively), two brothers who duped their relatives in Pakistan to travel to London in pursuit of their musical aspirations. He also brings aboard Priya (played by Asin), a music enthusiast from a conservative South Indian family. Back in India, Mannu seduces married women and finds himself in debt with the locals. After paying his debt, Mannu goes to London to join Arjun's band, but becomes more popular with the crowds. Mannu also flirts with Priya. The band embarks on a three-city tour spanning Paris, Rome, and Amsterdam where Arjun deceives a naive Mannu into a rollercoaster ride of promiscuous sex and illicit drugs. He tricks him, gets him addicted to drugs, and then gets him arrested in a car full of them. While pretending to help Mannu, Arjun leaks the drug story to the press. As the three-city tour concludes, the band heads to London to perform at Wembley Stadium in front of an audience estimated at 90,000 (which is of significance since, earlier in the movie, the viewer is told that Arjun's grandfather had failed before a similarly huge audience). Knowing how important this is for Arjun, Mannu tries to give up drugs. But Arjun decides that his success and Mannu's total failure are related. He pays a girl to pretend to have oral sex with Mannu, which makes Priya break up with Mannu. In this fragile state, Zoheb pushes Mannu toward drugs again and his mental state is now so fragile that he can't face appearing on stage. In the moments leading up to the stage entrance, Mannu comes to senses and chooses the righteous path and runs to support his mate. But Arjun, who has become incensed with the crowd chanting Mannu's name, confesses his envy of Mannu's talent and what he did to finish Mannu off. The audience boos Arjun, the show ends in chaos, the band breaks up and a sad Mannu eventually returns to his village. Arjun's uncle advises him to apologize to Mannu. Then it is revealed that after knowing the truth Priya and Mannu reconcile. Also, she marries Mannu and lives with him in his village. In the village, however, Mannu tells him not to apologize saying that it was his fault that he didn't see Arjun's sorrow and Priya also pardons Arjun for his wrong deeds. They get back together and London Dreams becomes a successful band again.

BiographyEarly life= Nino was born Stefanos Sakellarios Xypolitas in Stockholm on 29 June 1981, and shortly after moved with his family to Rhodes. His first experience with music was at age three, when his parents gave him a piano as a gift. At a young age Nino wrote his first song, titled \\"Eisai To Pio Omorfo Pou Iparhi\\" (\\"You are the most beautiful that exists\\"), dedicated to his mother. He learned to play the harmonium, guitar (electric classical), drums, harmonica, accordion, and bass by the age of 16. His first real performance was at age 15 live at a night club, where he gained impressions. He started to take music seriously at the age 16. After school, Nino moved to Athens to pursue a music career, where he attended various auditions, while attending college for sound designing at the same time. Shortly after, Nino accepted to perform at a large night club back in Rhodes, and moved back. After a successful concert-series, Nino then went on and performed in Patras. = Personal life = Œôn May 2007, Nino was a victim of an armed attack. Two strangers riding on a motorcycle \\"squeezed\\" his car in an attempt to stop him on a road in Thessaloniki. Neither himself nor his brother, who was also in the car, were injured.. From 2008 to 2010, Nino dated Doukissa Nomikou. He then dated Chrysi Vardinoyannis whom he married in 2012, having two children: George Skeyos (born 2013) and Karen Agapi (born 2014). Their marriage ended in August 2017. Career2002‚Äì2003: Fame Story era= After a few years of performing at small venues, Nino decided to audition for the first season of \\"Fame Story\\". =2004: After Fame Story and Debut album= After being eliminated from \\"Fame Story\\", he received offers from various Greek labels acting as second optionners, as he was bound to sign to Heaven Music, the record company that had the management rights on the players of the game, and which a subsidiary of Ant-1 TV, airing Fame story. During the winter season of 2003‚Äì04, Nino appeared alongside Anna Vissi, Konstantinos Christoforou, and Hi-5 for a series of concert at club \\"Diogenis Studio\\". Follow those appearances, in early 2004, he appeared alongside Apostolia Zoi, Elena Paparizou, and Thanos Petrelis in a series of concerts at club Thalassa. In July 2004, Nino released his debut album titled Nino, Nino, Nino. The album contained 13 songs, mostly love ballads, along with songs containing folk and pop elements. The music for seven of the songs wewasenned by the then up-and- coming composer Kyriakos Papadopoulos. Additional music was penned by Christoforos Germenis and Takis Damaschis while two songs from the album were also penned by Grigoris Petrakos, a fellow gamer from \\"Fame Story\\". The lyrics were written by Vasilis Yiannopoulos, while Natalia Germanou wrote the lyrics for the song \\"Horis Na Se Ksero\\" (\\"Without knowing you\\"). The album debuted at No. 1 on Greek Album Chart and after 3 weeks was certified gold selling more than 20,000 copies. The album spawned many airplay hits such as \\"Kalimera\\", \\"Sa Navagoi\\", \\"As Telionoume\\", etc. After three months the album reached platinum status. Reception of the album was generally well perceived, while a magazine wrote \\"The El Nino phenomenon has just reached\\". For the winter season that followed, Nino appeared alongside Peggy Zina and Kostas Karafotis (another player within fame Story) for a series of concerts at the Apollon Club in Athens. =2005‚Äì2006: Eilikrinis and Epireastika= During the first half of 2005, Nino accompanied Peggy Zina for part of her world tour to Australia and the United Kingdom. Following the success of his debut album, Nino started working on his second album. Nino returned in November 2005 with a more mature sounding album titled Ilikrinis (Honest), containing 15 songs. The album featured more laika than his previous album. The first single from the album was \\"Fovamai\\" (I'm Scared), which gained substantial airplay. \\"Gia Na Eimai Ilikrinis\\" (To be honest) and \\"Sexy\\" were further released as radio singles. The album was certified gold. In March 2006, Nino released his third studio album Epireastika (Influenced), which included 11 songs. The cover of the album depicted Nino as a statue after special treatment, while it was notable for differing from traditional album covers that the Greek audience was accustomed to until that point. Stamatis Gonidis wrote two more songs, and they collaborated successfully for a series of concerts all winter long at club \\"Thalassa\\". The first single \\"Erota Mou\\" (My love) was a radio hit, while the music video was criticized for being too explicit. In September 2006, Nino accompanied Natassa Theodoridou on tour to the United States and Canada. For promotion of the album, Nino appereared alongside Elena Paparizou and Pashalis Terzis for a series of concerts at the Iera Odos Club in Athens during the winter season. Following those appearances, the show moved to club \\"Odeon\\" in Thessaloniki during the first half of 2007. =2007‚Äìpresent: Thavmata and I Parastasi Arxizei= In May 2007, Nino and his brother were attacked near Thessaloniki's airport, while returning to their hotel after his live appearance at a local club. Two people on a motorcycle shot their car with seventeen bullets fired from a Kalashnikov gun. No one was injured. The motorcycle driver and another passenger approached the car and began to shoot. The driver and the accompanying motorcycle then disappeared while police found seven bullet casings in the area. A year and a half after the release of his third album, Nino released his fourth one titled Thavmata (Miracles) on 29 October 2007. Many well-known composers and lyricists collaborated again with Nino on the album. Nino had a hand in writing many of the songs. The first single was \\"Thavmata\\", which received some success on the radio. On 31 October 2007, Nino appeared with Elena Paparizou for a concert in Cyprus's Eleftheria Stadium. During the first half of 2008, Nino appeared alongside Chrispa and Andreas Stamos at Thalassa Club in Athens for the promotion of his album.

Nino's fifth studio album, I Parastasi Arhizei (The show begins), although recorded in 2008 was finally released on 22 November 2009. The album, originally planned to be released in October 2008, was delayed due to a rift created between Nino and Heaven Music after his unwillingness to renew his contract with the label. Nino's contract with the label ended in November 2009, forcing the label to grudgingly release the album as stipulated under their contract. The album, which contains 11 songs, was released via Espresso newspaper Sunday issue, as a premium give-away. The album was released with no promotion, and will not be re-issued by the company. Thus, it is \\"limited edition\\". On 11 December 2009, Nino signed a five-year contract with Greek songwriter Phoebus's record label, called The Spicy Effect, the same day Elli Kokkinou was signed.

It was designed as part of Project Genie and marketed by Scientific Data Systems for the SDS 940 computer system. It was the first commercial time- sharing which allowed general-purpose user programming, including machine language. History In the mid-1960s, most computers used batch processing: one user at a time with no interactivity. A few pioneering systems such as the Atlas Supervisor at the University of Manchester, Compatible Time-Sharing System at MIT, and the Dartmouth Time Sharing System at Dartmouth College required large expensive machines. Implementation started in 1964 with the arrival of the SDS 930 which was modified slightly, and an operating system was written from scratch. Students who worked on the Berkeley Timesharing System included undergraduates Chuck Thacker and L. Peter Deutsch and doctoral student Butler Lampson.Butler Lampson - Systems The heart of the system was the Monitor (roughly what is now usually called a kernel) and the Executive (roughly what is now usually called a command-line interface). When the system was working, Max Palevsky, founder of Scientific Data Systems, was at first not interested in selling it as a product. He thought timesharing had no commercial demand. However, as other customers expressed interest, it was put on the SDS pricelist as an expensive variant of the 930. By November 1967 it was being sold commercially as the SDS 940. By August 1968 a version 2.0 was announced that was just called the \\"SDS 940 Time-Sharing System\\". Other timesharing systems were generally one-of-a-kind systems, or limited to a single application (such as teaching Dartmouth BASIC). The 940 was the first to allow for general-purpose programming, and sold about 60 units: not large by today's standards, but it was a significant part of SDS' revenues. One customer was Bolt, Beranek and Newman. The TENEX operating system for the PDP-10 mainframe computer used many features of the SDS 940 Time-Sharing System system, but extended the memory management to include demand paging. Some concepts of the operating system also influenced the design of Unix, whose designer Ken Thompson worked on the SDS 940 while at Berkeley. The QED text editor was first implemented by Butler Lampson and L. Peter Deutsch for the Berkeley Timesharing System in 1967. Another major customer was Tymshare, who used the system to become the USA's best known commercial timesharing service in the late 1960s. By 1972, Tymshare alone had 23 systems in operation.

Walsh, and starring Lon Chaney and Pauline Bush. The film is now considered to be lost. A still exists showing Lon Chaney in the role of Tomasco, the hunchbacked fisherman. Plot Mario Busoni is a young sculptor, whose uncle is Father Busoni, pastor of the Church of the Holy Name at Fiesole. Mario is hired to sculpt a life-sized statue of the Madonna for his uncle's church, and he is sent to Naples to do the work. There he meets Janice, a young model who invites him to live with her, but his uncle arrives and thwarts her plans. She tries to ensnare the young boy again later, but the uncle intervenes once more. Meanwhile, Mario tells his uncle that he must have a live model to work from; he hires Mary, a young widow who is raising a baby boy on her own, and he uses them both to model for his statue of the Virgin and Child. Tomasco, a hunchbacked fisherman (Lon Chaney), is in love with Mary, and when she rejects his proposal of marriage, he suspects Mario of being his rival. Janice learns that Mario is planning to marry Mary, which foils both Tomasco's, and her own, happiness. Upon hearing that Mario has finished his statue, Tomasco and Janice both plot together to sneak into the church at night and destroy the statue out of revenge. They arrive at the church with a sledge hammer where they see the finished work. But Tomasco is incapable of destroying the beautiful statue. Janice laughs at his sentiment and picks up the hammer, but just as she is about to destroy the statue, the eyes of the Madonna open, and the two transgressors fall to their knees at the statue's feet and pray for forgiveness. The story ends near Mary's seaside home, with Mario and Mary in a loving embrace, and Father Busoni holding aloft her baby who claps his hands joyfully at the sight of the surf. Cast * William C.

It opened in 1852 as far as Port Dinorwic (now Y Felinheli) and was extended to Caernarfon later in the same year. At first Carnarvon station was a terminus, but a through line from Afon Wen and a branch line to Llanberis were built by other companies. At first those lines were not connected but in 1870 the Carnarvon Town Line was opened, penetrating the town by a short tunnel and connecting the other lines. The ordinary use of the line declined after 1945, but the Investiture of Prince Charles at Carnarvon in 1969 involved special use of the branch. However it closed in January 1970. In May of the same year, there was a catastrophic fire in the Britannia Bridge and the rail-borne container traffic was unable to connect Holyhead for the Irish ferry services. Caernarfon goods station was quickly brought back into use, in June 1970. When the Britannia Bridge was reopened, the Caernarfon line was finally closed on 5 January 1972. Conception The Bangor and Carnarvon RailwayThe Chester and Holyhead Railway opened its line from Chester to Bangor on 1 May 1848. This was followed on 1 August 1848 by opening on Anglesey, from Llanfair to Holyhead. The intervening section was delayed by the construction of the bridge over the Menai Strait, which came to be known as the Britannia Bridge; it opened in 1850.Peter E Baughan, The Chester and Holyhead Railway: volume 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1973, , page 296 Caernarfon (then spelt Carnarvon) was an established regional centre, and a rail connection had long been considered. The Chester and Holyhead Railway had contemplated building a branch line, but in fact it was a private scheme which gained support, to Port Dinorwic only at first. The Bangor and Carnarvon Railway was authorised on 20 May 1851.Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 28 Its Act permitted the Chester and Holyhead Railway to work the line. It was to make a junction with the C&HR; main line at a junction a little east of Britannia Bridge.Peter E Baughan, Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 11: North and Mid Wales, David St John Thomas, 1991, Nairn, , pages 92 to 100J F Gairns, The North Wales Coast Lines of the L.M.S.R., in Railway Magazine, July 1925 Port Dinorwic had been provided with a dock in 1828,Reg Chambers Jones, Felinheli: Personal History of the Port of Dinorwic, Bridge Books, 1992, its principal traffic being the export of slate. The Dinorwic Railway connected to it, superseded from 1843 by the Padarn Railway. The Bangor and Carnarvon Railway reached Port Dinorwic on 1 March 1852, and the chief traffic of the new railway was slate. Passenger traffic started nine days later. It was a single line.Bill Rear, From Chester to Holyhead: the Branch Lines, Oxford Publishing Company, Hersham, 2003, , pages 137 and 139 The extension to Carnarvon was undertaken immediately, and the line was opened throughout to Carnarvon on 1 July 1852; goods and mineral traffic started on 10 July 1852. The extension diverged from the Port Dinorwic line about a mile east of that place, necessitated by the ground levels: the continuation had to be above the level of the Port. The stub to the port became known as the Port Siding. The Bangor and Carnarvon Railway was leased to the Chester and Holyhead Railway in 1854, and absorbed by the London and North Western Railway (which had itself absorbed the C&HR;) in 1867.Dates from Baughan and Grant; Gairns, writing in 1925, said leased \\"from the date of its opening and was taken over in 1858 [by the LNWR]\\" but this appears to be a mistake. The passenger train service was good, six trains running each way daily, with three on Sundays; population growth in the district was vigorous. On 9 May 1865 there was an accident at the Menai Bridge Junction station; a train from Carnarvon was standing in the branch loop platform at a signal at danger. The exit from the platform was in the up direction; it would cross the down main C&HR; line, and a down train was approaching on that line. The driver of the Carnarvon train was given the right-away by his guard, and he started away without checking the starting signal, which was still at danger. 25 persons were injured in the resulting collision.Report on the Accident at Menai Bridge Junction on 9 May 1865, Captain H W Tyler, Board of Trade, available at https://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docsummary.php?docID=3587 In 1871 powers were obtained to double the line, and the Menai Bridge to Treborth section and the Port Dinorwic to Caernarfon sections were doubled in 1872; the central section was finished in 1874, including a duplicate bore for Vaynol Tunnel. Carnarvonshire Railway In 1867 the Carnarvonshire Railway was opened from Pant southward to Afon Wen: Pant was south of the Seiont River.Baughan, Regional History, pages 101 to 105 Carnarvon and Llanberis Railway In 1864 the Carnarvon and Llanberis Railway was authorised. It was to run from the Carnarvonshire Railway near its Carnarvon terminus, to Llanberis. Slate was to be the primary traffic. In 1865 a connecting line was authorised, northwards from the Carnarvonshire Railway to join the Bangor and Carnarvon Railway on the north side of the town: it became known as the Carnarvon Town Line. The C&LR; was short of cash to build the Town Line: the LNWR seized the opportunity, and acquired joint ownership of the Llanberis end of the (unbuilt) line and running powers over the rest of the line, in exchange for permission to use the B&CR; station at Carnarvon. Relations between the LNWR and the C&LR; board were difficult, and the matter was resolved when in 1868 the LNWR acquired joint ownership of the whole line, and agreement to work the line. The LNWR expedited the construction, and the C&LR; line opened on 1 July 1879, but only as far as a Morfa station, short of the planned point of convergence with the Carnarvonshire Railway line. Carnarvon Town Line The Carnarvon Town Line was opened by the LNWR on 5 July 1870 for goods traffic only. It included connections to the Carnarvonshire Railway and the Llanberis line on the south side of the town. The construction within the town was cramped, and the station had a single platform. The line opened for passenger trains in January 1871. 1895 train service Bradshaw's Guide for 1895 shows the passenger service: there were eight trains each way daily, and two on Sundays. Not all of the trains called at all the stations.Bradshaw's Rail Times for Great Britain and Ireland: December 1895, reprint, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2018, Carnarvon station In 1894 the station at Carnarvon was enlarged with enhanced goods and passenger facilities. In 1911, there was an investiture of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), at Carnarvon. Special platforms were constructed for those attending; the Royal Train used Griffiths Crossing.Baughan, Regional History, page 104 After 1939 During World War II a naval college was established close to Penychain station, near Pwllheli on the Barmouth line. After the war the site was developed as a Butlin's Holiday Camp, opened to the public in the Spring of 1947. Considerable numbers of holiday makers stayed at the camp, and nearly all travelled by train at that time; numerous summer holiday trains were run. While much of the extra service was from the south via Shrewsbury, there was an enhanced service between Penychain and Pwllheli, and Bangor, in some cases continuing through to Manchester and Liverpool. In 1957 diesel multiple units were introduced onto some of the services on the line but steam still dominated. On 7 December 1964 the passenger service between Caernarfon and Afon Wen closed, and the Llanberis line closed completely on 7 September 1964. Caernarvon station was therefore a terminus, served only from Menai Bridge Junction; the line was singled in 1966. From the summer of 1965 there were still some longer-distance workings. The Butlin's Holiday Camp traffic was still catered for, but now this involved a transfer at Caernarfon to road coaches; this proved an unpopular arrangement at a time when road transport throughout was increasingly available, and use of the train service declined steeply. On 1 July 1969 Prince Charles was invested as Prince of Wales at Caernarfon and several special trains were run. Empty stock was stored on the remaining stub section of the Afon Wen line. Ordinary traffic on the branch continued to decline, and the goods service was withdrawn on 4 August 1969; the passenger service was withdrawn on 5 January 1970, and the branch closed completely.Baughan, Regional History, pages 104 and 105Caernarvon, on Disused Stations Site Record website, at http://www.disused- stations.org.uk/c/caernarvon/ Britannia Bridge fire On 23 May 1970 there was a catastrophic fire on the Britannia Bridge, which resulted in its immediate temporary closure. isolated Holyhead from the railway network; Holyhead was, at that time, an important freightliner depot for Irish traffic, and was of course inaccessible. Emergency arrangements were made to reopen Caernarfon goods yard as a temporary container terminal for freightliner services; this arrangement started on 15 June 1970. On restoration of the Britannia Bridge, the use of Caernarfon ceased and the line was again closed completely on 5 February 1972.

The film is now considered to be lost. Some sources list this as a 1915 film, but the Blake book on Chaney says it was released specifically on Nov. 7, 1914. A still from the film exists that shows Lon Chaney as the Pimp, seated second from left. Chaney's co-star in this film, Rupert Julian, later directed him in The Phantom of the Opera (1925). Plot Ruth's uncle is the proprietor of the only hotel in Maplehurst, a small rural town. When she was orphaned years earlier, she was adopted by Dick, a young hotel clerk who now loves her dearly. Ruth cares for Dick, but feels he is too rustic. One day, a slick young Snob from the East arrives in Maplehurst and Ruth is taken in by his flashy clothes and fast car. Dick is crushed when his sweetheart goes off with the scoundrel. On one of her long drives with the snob, they stop at an inn, where he gets her drunk and takes advantage of her, impregnating her. When he moves back East, Ruth follows him, but he soon tires of her and throws her to the curb. She later gives birth to their child in a rundown big city boarding house, and the snob's family refuses to even see her when she goes to them for help. A local pimp (Lon Chaney) suggests that she become a prostitute, and Ruth starts to consider suicide; however, an elderly, childless couple take an interest in her and her baby. Ruth decides to write her uncle for help, and Dick intercepts the letter and sends her money. Her uncle soon after passes away, and Dick inherits the hotel. He searches for Ruth to bring her back home. Meanwhile the Snob has gone West, where the rugged environment has made a man out of him. He comes back to Ruth ready to accept his paternal responsibility, but she scorns him and refuses to even let him see their child. Cast * Pauline Bush as Ruth (Pauline in some sources) * Lon Chaney as The Pimp * William Lloyd as the Hotel Proprietor * Richard Rosson as Dick, the Boyfriend * Rupert Julian as The Snob * Murdock MacQuarrie as The Snob's Father * Martha Mattox Reception Moving Picture World wrote: \\"A three-reel number, written by Beatrice Van and produced by Allan Dwan. Pauline Bush is featured as a country girl lured to the city by a visiting stranger, who soon deserts her. He returns later, after the baby is born, but she spurns him and goes to her country lover. This is appealingly acted and well photographed, the chief drawback being that all of the situations are very familiar. In a production of this length there should have been more novelty. At the same time the story is connected and well developed.\\" Motion Picture News wrote: \\"This drama featuring Pauline Bush and Rupert Julian contains just a plain story and nothing of the impossible. Bit in its plainness it is extraordinary....The photography is good, the scenes and settings that appear are well laid, but not much variety is given. The whole drama will appeal more to the serious and better educated of the average audience.\\" Blake, Michael F. (1998). \\"The Films of Lon Chaney\\". Vestal Press Inc. Page 28. .

He earned 14 caps for Yugoslavia in the mid 1980s. Following his playing career, Stojiƒá started working as a players' agent. Club career Stojiƒá started out at his hometown side Iskra Bugojno in the Yugoslav Second League. He made his senior debuts in the 1976‚Äì77 season. In 1978, Stojiƒá moved to Belgrade and joined lower league club Zvezdara. He was transferred to Yugoslav First League side Partizan in the summer of 1980. Over the next four seasons at the Stadion JNA, Stojiƒá made over 100 competitive appearances for the Crno-beli, helping them win the national championship in 1983. He switched to Dinamo Zagreb the following summer, staying with the Modri for the next three years. In the summer of 1987, Stojiƒá moved abroad and joined Belgian club RFC Li√®geois. He played in the country over the following 10 years and also represented Anderlecht, Charleroi (two spells), RFC S√©r√©sien and Royal Antwerp, before retiring from the game. International career Stojiƒá made his international debut for Yugoslavia in a friendly away at Scotland on 12 September 1984, under newly appointed manager Milo≈° Milutinoviƒá, as the team was still reeling from the disastrous showing at UEFA Euro 1984 earlier that summer. In addition to Stojiƒá, six other players got their debuts that day in Glasgow; starters Edin Bahtiƒá, Fadilj Vokri, Petar Georgijevski and Zoran Batroviƒá, as well as subs Davor Joziƒá and Darko Panƒçev. At halftime, Stojiƒá was brought on for Dragan Panteliƒá with Yugoslavia trailing 1‚Äì3. He conceded three more goals as the match ended in an embarrassing 1‚Äì6 loss for Yugoslavia. Still, Stojiƒá left a good enough impression in Scotland to get a start two weeks later for the opening World Cup 1986 qualifier at home versus Bulgaria. The game ended in a goalless draw. Post-playing career In 1997, Stojiƒá founded Dynamic Agency, a company for sports management and consulting. Some of his clients included French internationals Louis Saha, Jean-Alain Boumsong, Olivier Kapo, and Djibril Ciss√©. He was also responsible for the transfers of numerous Serbian footballers abroad, including those of Nenad Tomoviƒá, Filip ƒêorƒëeviƒá and Nemanja Pejƒçinoviƒá, among others. In addition to his business, Stojiƒá became a main sponsor of Serbian club Rad in the early 2000s. He remained in the role for over a decade, before leaving the position in 2013. Afterwards, Stojiƒá served as sporting director for Slovenian club Olimpija Ljubljana on two occasions, both times under the presidential reign of Milan Mandariƒá.

On 20 June 1812, Stamford Raffles led a 1,200-strong British force to attack the walled royal city of Yogyakarta. Although they outnumbered the British, the Javanese were unprepared for the attack. Yogyakarta fell in one day, and the palace was sacked and burned. A total of ¬£15,000 in gold, jewels and currency (currently valued at ¬£500,000) was looted.

The wooden buildings of the complex have a traditional Javanese architectural style, decorated with flora, fauna, or nature motifs. Foreign influences (Portuguese, Dutch, and Chinese) are also seen. The buildings are of joglo construction. The trapezoidal joglo roof is usually covered with red or gray shingles, tiles, or zinc.

The film is framed by both a beginning and an ending sequence showing the three Fates weaving the threads of Mankind, these sequences being hand-colored (the rest of the film was in black-and-white). Plot The story follows the lives of two children: a wealthy boy and a poor girl. The rich boy grows up to be a musician, while the girl develops into a charming young woman. The man tires of society life, and travels the countryside disguised as a street musician. The woman goes to the city and is adopted by a wealthy aunt, who introduces her to the Count (Lon Chaney), whom the aunt has arranged to marry the girl. One night, she leaves the house dressed as a simple country maid, and she is attracted to the beautiful melody of a violin. She follows the music and meets the man who is playing it, and a warm friendship soon develops. The two meet regularly, and neither one reveals their true identity to the other. The woman feels her love for the musician is hopeless, since he is beneath her class, and she reluctantly consents to marry the Count. The violin player (who is in reality of noble birth) is distraught when the girl stops visiting him, and he returns to his dissipated high society life. Some time later, the woman, now trapped in a loveless marriage to the Count, hears the familiar sound of the violin. She finds the man, and this time their true identities are revealed. Realizing they are both people of wealth, the two plan to run away together, but the Count discovers their plans and pursues them. Rather than be separated, the two young lovers drive their car off a cliff to their deaths. Cast * Pauline Bush - The Wife * William C.

Khan - Government of Pakistan It is located at 31¬∞44'3N 70¬∞20'11E and has an altitude of .Location of Daraban - Falling Rain Genomics Daraban Kalan, pronounced ‚ÄúDraban ‚Äú is to be distinguished from Daraban Khurd, a village lying to the east of Dera Ismail Khan city. Draban lies west of Dera Ismail khan in the foothills of Sulaiman Mountains .  Etymology  There are various theories as to the origin of the word Daraban.The surname Daraban originates in Romania. The meaning of daraban is: guardsman. There is no other variation of this name even though there are other surnames similar to it. Daraban is also one of the most uncommon surnames in the world with only 28 found in the United States. There are only 1528 people found worldwide with the surname Daraban. it is estimated that there are about 5750 people with this surname worldwide. The surname appears to be in no way related to Pakistan or any country in the Middle East. The town of Darabani can be found in the Botasani Region of Romania. This information can be verified in the Readers Digest Atlas of The World (any edition). The majority of all persons bearing the Daraban name reside in Romania (1207) and Moldova (159) and the remaining known Daraban's reside in The United States (97), the UK (22) and Hungary (9). More information regarding the number of people with the surname Daraban and its meaning and origin can be found at http://www.locatemyname.com/ukraine/Daraban The word ‚ÄúDaraban‚Äù, according to some accounts actually came from term ‚ÄùDurruh-Bund‚Äù which means the closed pass. Centuries back the people who settled down in present-day Draban aimed to close the pass which connected Draban with Sherani hills. Sherani hill tribe in those days was in habit of pillaging villages in Damaan below their hills. The term \\"Durruh_Bund\\" in due course of time became the name of the village of people living in present-day Draban. ‚ÄùDurruh-Bund‚Äù got shortened as Daraban and now in further reduced form the word is pronounced as Draban. According to another popular narrative the words Daraban and Darazinda, the chief town of F.R Sherani originate in similar sound, are Persian in origin and can be traced back to Dara Shikoh, a son of Mughal king Shajahan. Daraban as per this account gets translated as Dara's forest, here came to hunt wild animals, while Darazianda was his zindan, or prison, there he kept his prisoners. The former account as to the origin of the name of the town seems more plausible and is very much attested by the history of enmity and hostility between Sherani tribe and Miankhel Pashtoon possessors of Draban.  History  Not much is known about the earliest history of Daraban, perhaps it grew out of small villages lying in the foothills of Sulaiman Mountains and later on, due to its geographical setting grew in size and population. Some of tribes came to Daraban from Zhob by their family wars mostly Miankhel also live in Zhob Balouchistan specially mallakhel came from Zhob to Daraban before independence. Its early inhabitants could have been either Saraikis or Pashtoons or both. The idea of Saraikis being the indigenous people of the region is bolstered by the fact that the region is part of Pashtoon but the Saraiki people over there and the Baoloch is only name in this tehsil. In addition, Saraikis constitute the majority of District Dera Ismail Khan, so it seems plausible that Pashtoons were the later arrivals in Daraban and areas around it. On the other hand, it is equally possible that Pashtoon nomadic tribes founded Daraban. If the name Daraban really originated in ‚ÄùDurruh-Bund‚Äù then Pashtoons were its founders, as they aimed to close pass leading to the mountains because of their quarrels and blood feuds with the Sheranis. The Pashtoons have been coming into this western part of Dera Ismail khan through Gomal Pass since the 13th century. These Pashtoon Powindas followed patterns of seasonal migration; they journeyed in caravans to Dera Ismail Khan and other lands beyond Indus and returned to Afghanistan with the onset of hot weather. With the passage of time some of these nomads began to settle on the land on permanent basis. The lodhi tribe is believed to have settled in the area of Draban in the time of Shahbu -din -Ghori in the beginning of the 13th century. In between (1555 and 1600 AD) Miankhels tribe invaded the area and after defeating the Lodhis became the new possessors of Draban. The Miankhels are still most influential in terms of politics and economics in Draban and neighbouring Musazai town. Historical pattern of Pashtoons leaving their mountains and settling on the plains of Damaan continues even today. Many Sheranis of the Sulaiman Mountains have settled in Draban permanently. In addition, Nasir, another Pashtoon tribe has, casting aside its nomadic way of life, has started living in permanent settlements in the peripheries of Daraban. The said tribe, being the newest arrival, has not been accorded proper acceptance as a legal residents of Daraban, and their hasty attempts at getting political influence has given rise to whole sorts of conflicts between Drabanwals and the Nasirs.  British era and its remains  The region constituting present day Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa was eventually colonised by the British. The effects and remains of colonialism could be observed even this remote part of Dera Ismail khan. The British built chains of Frontier Constabulary forts in the region to hold in check independent Pashtoons of the mountains. Darazinda, Draban, and Zarkani have FC forts built by the British. From these forts the British launched punitive expeditions in the mountains. Daraban boasts an FC fort, Assistant Commissioner court and large colonial style rest house, all relics of the Raj . Within the compound of the Assistant commissioner residence lies the grave of a British officer who died in action in Zarkani in colonial times. The British also built two bridges over the two perennial water streams flowing from the Sulaiman Mountains. The larger one was known locally as Kali Pul, and smaller one was called Sawi Pul . Kali Pul some years ago was sold in auction after the government replaced it with a new, modern one. The British connected Dera Ismail Khan through telephone with FR Sherani and Zhob Balochistan. This telephone line is no longer in service and its poles and wires lying in utter neglect continue to be stolen by thieves.  Languages and ethnicity  Draban is a melting point of cultures and languages. The coming of the Pashtoons over the centuries in this part of the land has resulted in their interaction with the local Saraikis. Now things have come to such a pass that both linguistic groups have become bilingual. Pashtoons speak Saraiki like native speakers and the Saraikis speak Pasthto fluently. It is only Nasir and Sherani people who speak only Pashto. Miankhels and other Pashtoons speak fluent Saraiki in addition to their own native tongue. Centuries of close interaction of Pasthto with Saraiki have given the former language a unique Saraiki touch. And Saraiki has under the influence of Pasthto acquired a unique flavour of its own. Pashto speakers constitute the majority of the region and own vast tracts of agricultural land and have dominant political influence in the area. Ethnic and racial strife between Pashtoons and Saraikis is non-existent, still Pashtoons like to marry only within their own community.  Geographic location and communication  Daraban lies at the foot of Sulaiman mountains. The peaks of Takht e Sulaiman, which can be seen from Daraban, are a part of myth and folklore of the people who live in whole of Damaan. Daraban enjoys privileged geographic position in the whole of neighbouring region and this accounts for its burgeoning trade and population. The town is connected by road with neighbouring towns of Darazinada, Musazai, and Chaudwan. The inhabitants of these towns have to pass through Daraban while journeying to Dera Ismail Khan city. Daraban also lies on the national highway connecting Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa with Baluchistan. The highway was built by National Highway authority almost eight years ago and is playing vital role in the development and progress of this region. Traveling to Zhob and Quetta from Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa was quite difficult before the construction of this highway. Travelers had to suffer a long ordeal in travelling to Balochistan through a much longer route via the province of Punjab and Sindh. The highway has also resulted in increase of trade and commerce in Daraban and areas around it.  Educational institutions  In terms of literacy rate and educational standards, Draban and its bordering areas lag behind the rest of Dera Ismail khan. A high school was established in the town in 1953, but only a decade ago it was upgraded to the status of higher secondary school.  Places worth visiting around Draban  The town of Draban itself offers little in terms of sightseeing, tourism or adventure. So it is neighbouring mountains where mostly people end up in their quest for enjoyment, recreation and fun. Near Darazinda, Peer Ghundai, another sight of abundant waterfalls and scenery is a major attraction. But it is trip to Takht-e-Sulaiman which is most common excursion for the people. The trip to this 3400 M high summit is undertaken in summer and usually takes two days journey on foot over difficult mountain terrain. On the summit there is a religious shrine and a Takht related with prophet Sulaiman. To the south of Draban lies the town of Musa Zai Sharif boasting an important khankah of Nashbaniah Sufi tradition. The shrine houses tombs of Dost Muhammad Qandhari, Usman Damani, Sirjuddin, Ibrahim, Ismail. The shrine of Musa zai is quite well known in the whole region and the devotees visit it from all over Pakistan, Afghanistan India and even from Arab countries. Khankah of Shaikh Ghulam Yaseen Sahib, known as Agah Sahib and tombs of his sons Faiz Muhammad Sahib, Muhammad Din Sahib is well known and people from all over of the Pakistan come to visit their tombs.  Takht-e- Sulaiman  The following is an account of journey undertaken in 2001 by Salahuddin Sikander, the contributor of Daraban page on Wikipedia and his friends to Takht-i-Sulaiman. The account was published in Daily Dawn, Daily the Frontier Post, and daily the News . Takht-i-Sulaiman, the highest peak of the Sulaiman range () is shrouded in myth and mystery. Named after Solomon, the wise Jewish prophet, the peak, on account of its perceived association with the prophet, is believed to possess a strange healing quality. People in Damaan also believe that Prophet Sulaiman, by exercising his miraculous power, had confined those mischievous Jinns inside it who had refused to obey his command. The evil-spirited Jinns are supposed to remain imprisoned almost all the year, and in Safar, the second month of the Islamic calendar, they are allowed to go free for a while. During this month, after darkness falls over the region, mothers restrict their children within their homes as a precaution against the evil effects of these Jinns. Takht-i-Sulaiman rises to a height of 3382 meters above sea level. A trip to the mountain is undertaken mostly in summer, and in winter heavy snowfall makes it difficult to approach it from late November until March. The locals believe that infertile women can be blessed with fertility when they visit Takht-i-Sulaiman. Religious connotations apart, Takht-i-Sulaiman is a mountainous area, with opportunities of trekking and climbing. It can be reached either through Balochistan or NWFP.

In some colonies, the units were led by officers seconded from the British Army. Especially in the case of units that recruited non-whites, even in colonies where the officers were primarily colonials, commissions were generally restricted to whites until after the Second World War. Non-white colonials, as well as non-whites from Britain itself (who were for a time assigned to British West Indian Regiments of the British Army as a matter of policy, even if enlisting in Britain) served primarily in the other ranks. Although militias operating on the same principle as the militia in England and Wales were established in many colonies during the 17th and 18th Centuries, from the 19th Century onwards colonial units were mostly voluntary, and supplied a reserve force either to be called up in war time to reinforce regular British Army garrisons for home defence, or in some cases were entirely responsible for home defence. Many units, however, took part in active campaigns outside of the role of home defence in various conflicts the British Empire was involved in, including the two world wars. Some of the reserve colonial units, especially in the strategically-placed colonies (particularly Bermuda and Malta), were considered loosely part of the British Army, whereas others were considered auxiliaries (by example, the Bermuda Militia Artillery was grouped with the Royal Artillery and the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers with the Royal Engineers in the official Army Lists, which also listed the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps and Bermuda Militia Infantry officers, whereas most colonial units did not appear at all). Many colonial units started out as auxiliaries and later became regular units and forerunners to the current militaries of those colonies which have become politically independent. While most of the units listed here were army units, colonial marines were raised at various times, as were colonial naval and air force reserve units. Today, only four British Overseas Territories regiments remain (not including cadet corps): the Royal Bermuda Regiment; the Royal Gibraltar Regiment; the Falkland Islands Defence Force; and the Royal Montserrat Defence Force. The British Government is currently (2020) working with the local governments of the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Cayman Islands to raise reserve military units in those territories, also, with recruitment for the new Cayman Islands Regiment starting in January, 2020.TCI to build its own military regiment, by Olivia Rose.

He then moved to Eldas constituency which was curved from Wajir West. Keynan served as Eldas MP in the 11th Parliament and he was then re-elected to serve the same constituency in 12th parliament. Keynan is known as \\"kingmaker\\" of Wajir politics. In 2013 he brought little known Ahmed Abdullahi to battle senior politician Mohamed Abdi Mohamud as Wajir Governor. He succeeded in his mission. In the 2017 general election Kenyan led all elected leaders in the Jubilee Party and offered to support Amb Mohamed Abdi Mohamud for gubernatorial position. For the second time Keynan managed to achieve his aim. In Wajir County politics, they say it's either Dr. Keynan's way or face the 'dust'. In addition, he is the only MP who was re-elected from the county. Keynan formed a foundation known as Adan Keynan Foundation to help afforestation, education and youth and women empowerment. The foundation was formed 2011 and up to now runs major activities in Wajir county. Politics Through the years Eldas MP Aden Wehliye Keinan has demonstrated immense capabilities since joining politics in 1997 as an MP for the then Wajir West parliamentary seat that place him in poll position to assume greater national assignment and influence in the former North Eastern Province. Although he has avoided aspiring to be a leader in the former NEP a time has come for him to demonstrate his worth, deploy his vast experience and organizational prowess and steer the area for it to achieve its goals in national politics. Keinan's intellectual and oratory abilities in public life are legendary and never in doubt. The newsmedia and cameras love him and his articulation of issues. His capacity for hardwork and thorough output speaks for itself for he has left a mark to be envied and emulated as a member of Parliamentary Committees and Chairman of such committees. Politically speaking, Keinan is a ranking member of Kenya's legislature, whose cumulated experience in the august house is surpassed only by Vihiga Senator George Khaniri's tenure. But he has also set a record by sitting in the Parliamentary Service Commission PSC for three parliamentary terms besides winning a parliamentary seat for 15 consecutive years. He was the Vice Chairman of the PSC between 2011 and 2012 and is also a former member of the Kenya National Audit Commission. One can only achieve these feat after mastering local politics, endearing himself to the electorate and proving his worth to peers at the national level, the kind of qualities many politicians would love to have around yet these qualities also invite fear and envy in Kenya's noisy and competitive politics. Keinan's sterling record and appeal is not only a combination of solid academic performance, having graduated with a bachelor's, masters and Phd degrees but also natural personality and ability to fuse theory and practice in equal measure. For these efforts he has received local and global recognition and even presidential commendation for outstanding and distinguished service to the State. For his bachelors and masters programmes Keinan matriculated successfully at Moi and Kenyatta Universities, respectively, before being awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Public Administration (honoris causa) by the Commonwealth University in collaboration with the London Graduate School. His longevity in the legislature is not just an ornament or a matter that one wields as a badge without substance, for Keinan has chaired committees and steered them, purposely including during tense and divisive moments in Kenya's history. For years he sat in crucial and distinguished committees, not as mute bystander but a dependable member and architect of these committees recorded good performance. The MP's mastery of Standing Orders, domestic and international law enabled him to chair the Defence and Foreign Relations Committee during the highly divisive Tenth Parliament. As the chairman he, skillfully, rallied legislators from rival political formations to the singular cause of providing oversight on the Executive and protective public interest and national good. Without fear or favour. During that period Keinan audited highly, sensitive dockets in the security, military, immigration and foreign affairs dockets. By bringing top officials to account and checking their expenditure. Keinan was admired and also feared by those weaning Kenyans and technocrats who would rather have some things hidden from scrutiny, from the mistaken belief that certain dockets were too sensitive to be audited in public. Keinan chartered a new territory and set the precedent. To the public he emerged as a defender of public interest and enforcer of good. Yet despite his profile altercations with the Executive the MP also observed the spirit of his oath and honour of high office, for he never jeopardized National Security by leaking state secrets or endangering National Security, domestically or within the context of East and Horn of Africa politics.To date his record for churning completed reports for the Defense and Foreign Relations Committee remains uncontested in Kenya's Parliamentary history. A significant report of note was his inquest into the controversial land forKenya's new high commission in Tokyo which felled a Foreign Affairs ministry and triggered investigations that led to the indictment of various top level officials.Those who covered proceedings when Keinan moved motions for adoptions recall his intoxicating oratory and arguments laden with facts, logic and a deluge or supporting material with nostalgia, itself a product of hardwork that earned him admirers but also envy and rivalry. In the eleventh parliament Keinan, having been reelected as MP for Eldas and chaired the influential Public Investment Committee where he also investigated and audited top level state expenditure including at the defunct Kenya Petroleum Refineries Limited. Keinan is a member of the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, Parliamentarians for Global Action and Parliamentarians Against Corruption and an Executive Committee member of the Commonwealth Association of Public Accounts Committees. Besides, in the House Business Committee of the Kenyan Parliament, Keinan has also sat and contributed immensely as a member of the National Assembly's Energy, Communication, Information, Labour and Social Welfare between 2008 and 2012. He also served in the Finance and Planning and Trade Committee and also in the Administration, National Security and Local Government Committees between 1998 and 2002. Before joining politics Keinan was a Director at the National Housing Corporation between 1996 and 1997 and is also a recipient of Global Awards such as Spirit of Detroit Award in Michigan State University in 1999 in recognition of exceptional achievement and dedication to improvement of quality of life in Kenya. In 1999 Keinan received an award in the Role of Legislatures in Governance, Washington DC and in 2013 he was decorated Chief Order of the Burning Economic with the First Class Spear commendation by the President of Kenya for distinguished service to humanity and Kenya. With this outstanding qualities and proven record Keinan stands in good stead to assume new and bigger roles, not out of patronage and similar calculation but on the account of proven ability.

Born in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Evans obtained a B.A. from the University of Toronto in 1950, following which he earned a B.Phil. from Oxford University and a B.D. from McGill University. He was ordained as a pastor in the United Church of Canada in 1955. He was a professor of divinity at the University of Toronto from 1960 to 1964 (during which time he received a D.Phil. from Oxford), an associate professor of philosophy from 1964 to 1968, and full professor from 1968 until 1993. In his early work, his ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Logic of Self-Involvement‚Äô‚Äô (1963), Evans finds the meaning of religion within language. In his later works, his 1980 ‚Äò‚ÄôFaith, Authenticity, and Morality‚Äô‚Äô and his 1981 ‚Äò‚ÄôStruggle and Fulfillment,‚Äô‚Äô Evans finds the basis of religious belief in religious experience.‚Äò‚ÄôLanguage, Experience and the life well-lived: a review of the work of Donald Evans‚Äô‚Äô, Religious Studies Review, Vol. 9, No. 1.

It is a common identification with the suffering of others. The prominent idea is that both believers and non-believers grieve and rebel against suffering. To explain this term, Evans gives two fictional atheists-- Dostoievsky‚Äòs Ivan Karamazov and Camus‚Äòs Dr. Bernard Rieux--as examples of those whose ‚Äúcompassion is compounded with a sense of outrage and revulsion that nature and men should inflict mental and physical toruture on human beings.‚Äù Evans also quotes D.

It was first recorded by rock and soul singer Jackie Lomax and released in February 1970 as his final single on the Beatles' Apple record label. George Harrison produced the recording, which also features contributions from American musician Leon Russell. The single is unique in that, with Paul McCartney producing the B-side, each side was produced by a different member of the Beatles. Elvis Presley issued a recording of the song later in 1970 on his album That's the Way It Is. Presley's version was also the B-side of his 1971 single \\"I Just Can't Help Believin'\\", which became a top-ten hit in Britain and other European countries.

According to Tony Hiller, another London-based songwriter, David Most first approached Australian producer David Mackay with an idea for the song and Mackay provided the melody for the chorus. Westlake and Most completed the song and recorded a demo.Richards, pp. 48‚Äì49. This and several other Carlin demos were then submitted as material for Elvis Presley to record via Freddy Bienstock,Jorgensen, pp. 300‚Äì02, 322. who owned Carlin and looked after Presley's music publishing interests in the company Hill & Range.Guralnick, pp. 379‚Äì80. Like other ballads selected for Presley over this period, \\"How the Web Was Woven\\" is a love song with a dark theme.Simpson, pp. 144‚Äì45. It was also typical of the material sourced from Carlin's songwriters in terms of its European pop style, dramatic mood and dense musical arrangement.Guralnick, p. 379. Most told Record Mirror magazine that it was the third song he had written, after \\"Goodbye\\" and \\"Le Blon\\", recorded by Barry Ryan and Anita Harris, respectively. He also said that Percy Sledge was the singer he \\"had in mind\\" when writing the song.\\"Making It Most\\", Record Mirror, 2 January 1971, p. 6.

Lomax was reluctant to record the song. Harrison recognised the importance of the piano part and initially booked session pianist Nicky Hopkins to play on the track, but Hopkins became unavailable.O'Dell, pp. 95‚Äì96.

In June 2000, Smith and Nephew divested its consumer products division; a management buyout, led by CEO Geoff Percy and Finance Director Peter Hatherly, for ¬£140m resulted in the formation of Accantia, owner of the Simple brand.

During the 2008 European Aquatics Championships she came 4th in the final of the 100 m breaststroke in which she broke the national record of Brigitte Becue. With this excellent performance, she managed to qualify herself for the Olympics. At the Olympics, while still only 16 years of age, she qualified for the semi-finals for both the 100 m breaststroke and 200 m breaststroke with a new Belgian record; eventually she finished respectively 13th and 16th overall. In the period after the 2008 Olympics, Matthysen suffered both physically and mentally, mainly the result of weight problems. In December 2010, she hired Brigitte Becue as her coach, but Becue could not turn the tide and on 8 November 2011 Becue announced that Matthysen was retiring from swimming and focusing fully on her studies. At that point in time, she was still holder of the national record for the 100 m breaststroke.

The decision for its construction was taken in 1885, during the mayoralty of Georgios Theotokis, and construction started in 1893 by mayor Michael Theotokis. High construction costs delayed its inaugural opening until 1902. The architect was the Italian Conrado Pergolesi who developed plans modelled after La Scala in Milan. The maximum height of the theatre was 39 meters; there was a gallery at the front entrance adorned by high columns of the Tuscan order. The entrance featured large purple columns and its high walls were decorated with frescoes of famous composers created by Italian artists. The upper floor was decorated by four Corinthian order semi-columns and a gable. The official emblem shield of Corfu stood in relief at the centre of the gable surrounded by a laurel wreath. The auditorium included 64 decorated boxes arranged in three levels and a gallery for the general public at the top. The first box in the first row was reserved for the theatre committee.

The orchestra was mainly made up of locals and it performed 10 operas per cycle. Opera season started in September and ended on the Sunday before Ash Monday.

It also functioned as a social gathering place where high society gathered for dances and balls. Its official opening date was 7 December 1902, with Wagner's opera Lohengrin as the inaugural performance. Kaiser Wilhelm II also attended performances while vacationing at his Achilleion palace.

The first Spanish high-speed rail connection has been in use since 21 April 1992 at speeds up to 300 km/h (186 mph). Travel time between the two end points was reduced by over half. At C√≥rdoba the Madrid‚ÄìM√°laga high-speed rail line leaves the line from Madrid. At Seville the line is extended to C√°diz only for the Alvia service.  Routing AVEs in Seville's Santa Justa station. The line starts at Madrid-Atocha and runs over 31 bridges (total length ) and through 17 tunnels (total length , crossing the plains of the southern half of the Inner Plateau. It climbs south of Toledo as well as when crossing the Sierra Morena to an altitude of 800 meters, and then descends to around sea level as it approaches Seville. The terminus of the line is the new railway station Santa Justa in Seville.  Technical details The high-speed line was constructed at standard gauge, in contrast with the rest of the Spanish railway network. Voltage is 25 kV AC instead of 3000 V DC. Twelve transformers feed the overhead wires. Some before the start and end points of the line, the line merges with local DC tracks. The line was equipped with signalling standards that had been developed in the 80s for the German Hanover-W√ºrzburg high-speed rail line and the Mannheim-Stuttgart high-speed rail line. At the end of 2006, Spanish governmental agency ADIF ordered technical changes to the safety systems along the line for an amount of ‚Ç¨12.6 million, so that in the future, trains of the RENFE-type 104 will be able to run at 200 instead of 180 km/h. A further amount of ‚Ç¨4.1 million has been spent on changes to the ASFA train safety system.High speed advances in Spain. In: Railway Gazette International. 163, nr. 1, 2007, , page 4 Between the railway stations along the line, passing stations and emergency stations are located (in Spanish: Puesto de adelantamiento y estacionamiento de trenes, abbr. PAET). These allow faster trains to overtake slower trains, and the parking of rescue trains. In addition, most of these stations have basic platforms that can be used to let passengers descend and change to buses in case of emergency. Trains travel along the line at 300 km/h during the sections of the track close to Madrid. They travel at 200 km/h through the Sierra Morena region, possibly because the S/100 trains aren't pressure-sealed and this section includes many tunnels and also because of the tight curvatures in the Sierra Morena (occasionally dipping as low as 2300m). According to the HS2 website, a 200 km/h track needs a curvature of 1800m and a 400 km/h track needs a curvature of 7200m. As the necessary curvature increases in proportion to the square of the maximum velocity, the maximum safe speed for a curvature of 2300m would be 226 km/h, assuming no tilting technology: - only the AVE Class 100, AVE Class 102 and AVE Class 103 run through the Sierra Morena section, of which only the AVE Class 102 has tilting technology. The trains travel at a top speed of 250 km/h between C√≥rdoba and Seville, possibly on account of the AVANT services that also use the line, whose trains are limited to 250 km/h. On most journeys, the trains spend a very small proportion of the journey travelling above 250 km/h, although most of the M√°laga branch is done at 300 km/h (save for station approaches and the Gobantes and Abdalaj√≠s tunnels). The trains slow down to approximately 160 km/h when travelling through Ciudad Real station. They also have to slow down to 70 km/h when travelling through Puertollano station because of the lack of a bypass route and tight curvatures in the station.  History  AVE lines in Andalusia, including the later branch to Malaga. On 11 October 1986 the Spanish government decided to build a new railway between Madrid and Seville. On 25 February 1988, the international tender for the acquisition of 24 high- speed trains AVE followed; these trains were ordered by 23 December 1988. The first train, based on the third generation of TGVs, was delivered on 10 October 1991. In December 1988 it was decided to build the new line in standard gauge. Construction was ordered on 16 March 1989, and it lasted for 33 months; actual construction activity lasted only 24 months. Commercial use of the line commenced on 21 April 1992. In the first weeks, over 23 thousand passengers used the new trains - an occupancy rate of 81%. On 20 April 1992, services started between Madrid and Seville. Non-stop travel time between the two cities were 2:45 hrs; with stops at Ciudad Real, Puertollano and C√≥rdoba it was 2:55 hrs. In 1992, tickets cost around 50-70 euros in second class, in first class over 100 euros. In 2014, a new station was added in Villanueva de C√≥rdoba, between C√≥rdoba and Puertollano, to improve accessibility of the Los Pedroches region. The line later received branches in Andalusia. In October 2015 an extension of the Madrid-Seville high-speed rail line to C√°diz railway station was completed after 14 years of works and put in service by Alvia trains for speeds up to 200 km/h. = Impact = The new railway line radically changed the modal split between Madrid and Seville. The share of air traffic decreased between 1991 and 1994 from 40% to 13%; the combined share of car and bus decreased from 44% to 36%. The share of railway traffic increased from 16% to 51%, while total traffic increased by 35%.Moshe Givoni: Development and Impact of the Modern High-speed Train: A Review.

Morse (January 30, 1906 - May 19, 1984) was an American film director and editor. He is perhaps best known for directing the American scenes in Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, the \\"Americanized\\" version of the 1954 Japanese Godzilla film from Toho. The film went on to long-lasting success with regular showings at drive-in theatres, repertory theatres and on television. Its popularity completely obscured the original film which remained virtually unknown in the United States for several decades after its release. Biography Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Morse began his career as a film editor in 1927, and early in his career was credited as Terrell Morse, and later Terry Morse. Although he continued working as an editor throughout his career, he also directed films, starting with The Adventures of Jane Arden in 1939. Most of his career was spent at Warner Bros., and was usually within the crime melodrama genre, although he also directed some comedies. He was unhappy with the movies he was given to direct and went independent. By this time, Morse had gained a solid reputation as a \\"film doctor,\\" whose sharp editing skills helped to improve some movies. He was therefore asked to edit and direct new scenes in Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, spliced into the original film. At the time, the re-editing was so effective that American audiences were convinced that Raymond Burr had actually gone to Japan to shoot the picture. It became the most famous film he was involved with. His son, Terry Morse Jr. followed him into filmmaking, and is a film producer and director. Morse died in Newhall, California.

An amateur, Poyntz was an aggressive right-handed batsman. He generally played as part of the middle order, and though his batting was not exceptional, he was highly praised for his fielding ability. He captained Somerset in the two years prior to the First World War. The youngest son of the Chief Constable of Essex, Poyntz made his county cricket debut in 1905, hitting a half-century to help Somerset win their only match of that season. He achieved his best batting average in that year, while each of the following four were of little note. In 1910 he captained Somerset for the first time, and scored over 300 runs in a season for the second of five occasions. His only attempts at bowling occurred during 1911, when he claimed eight wickets at an average of almost forty. He was named as Somerset's official captain in 1913, and remained in charge for the following season. After serving in the Army during the First World War, Poyntz scored his only century in first-class cricket in a match for the Army against Cambridge University in 1919. He played two further matches for Somerset that year, after which he did not appear in first-class cricket again. Early life and career Poyntz was born on 27 October 1883 in Chelmsford, Essex. He was the youngest of seven children born to Major William Henry Poyntz and Henrietta Laycock. His father had achieved the rank of Major in the Royal Marines, and having served as the Chief Constable of Nottingham from 1872 until 1881,Poyntz (1892), p. 313. held the equivalent position in Essex at the time of his youngest son's birth. Poyntz senior was a cricket enthusiast, and during his time in Nottingham, he ran the police team, and wrote effusively in his reminiscences about watching Nottinghamshire face Yorkshire and Surrey.Poyntz (1892), p. 319. Educated at Haileybury College, Massey made the school's cricket team in 1901. The family had moved to Gotham House in Tiverton, north Devon, and after leaving school, Poyntz followed his older brother Hugh into the Somerset side. On his debut for Somerset, Poyntz batted strongly in the lower order to help secure Somerset's only victory of the season. Poyntz's score of 32 in the first innings could not prevent the follow-on, but in the second innings, he hit 60 runs to widen Somerset's lead to almost 150 runs, a total Gloucestershire failed to chase down. His success against Gloucestershire continued in the return fixture later that season, in which he scored 89 of Somerset's total of 169 in the first innings, and 42 runs in the second innings, though their opponents won by an innings after amassing 521 runs in their only innings. In all, Poyntz played five matches in his debut season, totalling 307 runs. His season's batting average of 34.11 was the highest of his career. In David Foot's history of Somerset cricket, after the 1903 season he wrote that \\"it's time discreetly to leap over undistinguished seasons.\\"Foot (1986), p. 79. Between 1903 and the cessation of county cricket due to the First World War, Somerset never finished higher than tenth in the County Championship.Foot (1986), p. 218. Poyntz himself struggled for runs between 1906 and 1909: in thirty matches for the county, he failed to score a half-century. Statistically, his worst season came in 1907, when he averaged just 4.66 runs per innings. His most notable incident that season occurred during the match against Middlesex at Lord's. In his own benefit match, Albert Trott claimed two hat-tricks; Poyntz was one of the victims, falling for a second innings duck. County captain In 1910, Poyntz captained Somerset for the first time, standing-in during the absence of the regular captain, John Daniell. In that season, he struck his first half-century since 1905, scoring 50 runs in the second innings of a match against Middlesex at Bath. He followed that with another in his next innings, finishing on 52 not out against Lancashire, though Somerset lost both matches by an innings. He finished the 1910 season with 363 runs at an average of 16.50, and appeared in a representative match for the West of England against the East. In their summary of the 1911 season, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack claimed that \\"the outlook for Somerset is cheerless.\\"Roebuck (1991), p. 108. The county finished bottom of the championship with only one victory, against Hampshire at Bath.Roebuck (1991), p. 107. Despite this, Poyntz had one of his most successful seasons: he scored 597 runs at an average of 22.96, and his five half-centuries were the most in any year of his career. He began the season with half-centuries in both innings of a drawn match with Hampshire in Southampton, and two matches later, he bowled for the first time in first-class cricket. Facing Lancashire, Poyntz was called upon as Somerset's ninth bowler in their opponent's second innings: only the captain Daniell and the wicket-keeper, Harry Chidgey, did not bowl. Poyntz bowled eight overs and three balls, and claimed five wickets; his best analysis in first-class cricket. He continued to bowl occasionally for the remainder of the season, but only claimed three further wickets, and finished his career with a bowling average of 39.62. Poyntz was unable to appear as often in 1912; he only played eight times for Somerset, six less than the season before. He scored 253 runs at an average 18.07 that year, and did not pass fifty run in an innings. Somerset's difficulties were not confined to the pitch. In 1912, the club made a loss of ¬£327, and they could not persuade Daniell to remain at the club rather than travel to India. Initially the county asked Arthur Newton, who was at that time 50 years old, to serve as captain, but after consideration he declined the role, and Poyntz was appointed instead. The team that he inherited remained a poor one: the Wisden summary in 1913 stated that they had, \\"no temptation to deal at any great length with the doings of Somerset\\".Roebuck (1991), p. 109. During a season in which his side had finished bottom of the championship with only two wins, Poyntz scored 363 runs at an average of 15.12, with a single half-century; 50 runs exactly scored against Derbyshire. The club once again recorded a loss during the season, and at the club's annual general meeting, the mood was negative. Despite this, Poyntz was reappointed as captain for 1914 after a proposal made by Bruce Hylton-Stewart and seconded by Newton. Rare optimism was shown by Newton and Poyntz, with the latter claiming that it was due to \\"a lot of bad luck that they [Somerset] did not finish half way up the table instead of at the bottom.\\"Roebuck (1991), p. 112. That optimism was not reflected in Somerset's results the following year. Further financial losses were made, and the county finished second-bottom of the championship. On a personal level, Poyntz scored more runs than in any other season, accruing 642 during his 19 matches at an average of 18.34, and scored three half-centuries. The start of the First World War during the summer of 1914 resulted in the cancellation of some matches, along with a number of players joining the armed forces, disrupting the end of the cricket season.Roebuck (1991), p. 113. Although Somerset fared poorly under his charge, David Foot claims that Poyntz received \\"more praise than criticism\\" for his captaincy.Foot (1986), p. 95. Wartime career and later life In September 1914, Poyntz was appointed to the 3rd Battalion, Bedfordshire Regiment. He received promotion to Lieutenant, and then Captain in 1915, before being transferred to the 2nd Battalion in December of that year, serving in the Somme under the command of his brother, Major Hugh Stainton Poyntz. He was shortly thereafter assigned command of \\"B\\" Company. He continued to command B Company during the Battle of the Somme. Poyntz commanded the 2nd Battalion for a while in 1917 during his brother's leave, but spent most of the remainder of the war in reserve with the 3rd Battalion. He completed his military service as a Major. Poyntz only played three further first-class cricket matches after the war. He made his highest total during a match for the Army against Cambridge University, at Fenner's. Batting at number eight, he struck 15 fours and 3 sixes to reach 114 runs in the second innings. The Army lost the match by 10 wickets. Later in the season, he his final appearances for Somerset, playing against Sussex and Hampshire under the captaincy of Daniell, averaging 10.00 from three innings. In all, Poyntz scored 3,127 runs during his first-class career at an average of 17.08. He died on 26 December 1934 in Minehead, Somerset. Style and technique Although not highly thought of as a batsman, Poyntz was known for being able to hit the ball hard. A right-handed batsman, he is described as lacking \\"technique and consistency\\" by David Foot, but obituaries suggest that his shortage of talent was offset by application of effort. Wisden declared him \\"an excellent fielder\\", but Foot is more reserved, describing him as a \\"passable slip fielder\\". Sammy Woods was Poyntz's godfather, while Poyntz in turn acted as a godfather to John Daniell's son Nigel. David Foot portrays an element of caricature about Poyntz, describing him as, \\"a tall man who slammed his hair back with a distinctive parting in the middle.\\" He also related a story from a Somerset teammate in which Poyntz claimed that he could trace him family all the way back to William the Conqueror, and had a massive coat of arms in his Bristol flat.

They dominated the 20th century proof press industry by developing the first and the most widely used proof presses that did not rely on gravity for the force of their impression. As a result, Vandercook's geared presses were easier and more precise for an operator to use. Vandercook was sold in 1968 to the Illinois Tool Works, when it became Vandersons. The company changed hands many times and is now called NA Graphics, a letterpress supply house, located in Silverton, Colorado. History In September 1909, Robert Vandercook founded Vandercook & Sons in Chicago, Illinois. The first press was a ‚Äúrocker‚Äù proof press, made with a geared cylinder. Before the development of this press, all proofs were either made on a roller press, which depended on gravity for impression or on a Washington Hand Press. Logo from 1968, right after being purchased by Illinois Tool Works. During the next 54 years they introduced 60 different press models. Over the course of its 75 year production history, Vandercook manufactured more than 38,000 presses under its brand name. The name of Vandercook & Sons was used until 1968 when E.O. Vandercook sold the company to one of their suppliers, Illinois Tool Works. They only kept the company for four years and then sold it to one of their managers, Hugh Fletcher, who renamed the company Vandersons Corporation. Vandersons stopped manufacturing presses in 1976 at which time they only made models HS27, SP20,Vandercook & Sons, SP-20 Manual SP25 and Universal I. After ceasing to manufacture presses, Vandersons continued selling parts and supplies for the thousands of presses that were still being used. In 1989 the company was sold to Stuart Evans. In January 1994, Tom Bell and Hal Sterne of NA Graphics bought the company and moved it to Cincinnati, Ohio. Then in October 1996 they sold NA Graphics to Fritz Klinke who moved the operation to Silverton, Colorado. NA Graphics is still selling parts and supplies for many of the models of Vandercook presses. Press models Before World War II, Vandercook developed 29 models, 17 of which were still being manufactured many years after the war. The most popular of these models was #4, which was first made in 1935 and not discontinued until 1960. Many are still in use today. In 1948 they brought out the model 4T, which was used to pull transparency proofs of type on acetate. The acetate proofs could then be contacted to film for offset negatives. During World War II not many presses were made because Vandercook was heavily involved in manufacturing for the war effort, for which they received the E award. One press they made for the government during the war was a model 055, 51‚Ä≥ x 75‚Ä≥ in size. With the exception of models 0, 01, 03 and 099, which were gravity type presses, all of the Vandercooks had geared cylinders. The last models designed were the SP series (which stands for Simple Precision) and the Universal series. They are similar in design but the Universal presses were originally designed as Test presses for ink companies and paper mills. Most of them were made with automatic controls and adjustable beds (AB). The SP series were mostly hand presses. The SP15 was the most popular of them all. Besides letterpress proof presses, Vandercook also made offset proof presses. The flat bed presses were the model 20-26 (wet) and 15-20 (dry). In 1968, they came out with model RO4-29. This unique 4 color model was an offset proofing press that featured a common impression cylinder surrounded by the 4 printing units. This press was capable of running 1500 sheets per hour and automatically producing progressive proofs. They also made 4 color letterpress wet proof presses; model 604 which was brought out in 1947 and 10 years later replaced by model 30-26 which was made until 1972. Prices for the early model rocker presses were from US$140 to $175 depending on the size. Forty years later the model 0 proof press was still only $175. Other prices in 1955 were: $1965 for a model 4 and $23,650 for a model 604. In 1958, The Universal I cost $2150.

Known as Edwin, he was born in Boston, Massachusetts where his Canadian parents had relatives. The son of James H. Ganong and Susan E. Brittain, he is the brother of Susie, Kit (Whidden), Arthur, and William. His family returned to their native New Brunswick when Edwin was still a young boy. Living in the border town of St. Stephen, in 1873 his father and uncle Gilbert Ganong founded Ganong Bros., a grocery and bakery business that became a very successful manufacturer of chocolate confectionery. In 1878 the brothers established the St. Croix Soap Manufacturing Company but in 1884 they elected to dissolve their partnership and Edwin's father became the sole owner of the soap factory. Edwin Ganong would join his father in his successful soap-making business. Following his father's untimely death in 1888, the twenty-two-year- old Edwin found himself in charge and quickly proved himself an astute businessman and marketer. His company was best known for its Surprise Soap that became a national brand which was produced until 1946. Advertising helped sell the company's products but Edwin seized other opportunities such as the 1894 publishing of The Surprise Cook Book, a recipe collection formally registered as The Premium Cook Book by the then widely popular American writer Marion Harland. On January 24, 1903, Edwin Ganong married Boston, Massachusetts native Anna Louisa Webb. The couple had a son, Brigadier General James Edwin Jr. In 1913, Edwin Ganong sold the St. Croix Soap Manufacturing Company to Lever Brothers of Toronto, Ontario, a subsidiary of the British conglomerate. Ganong became president of Lever Brothers and moved to Toronto. Socially active, they maintained a summer home at fashionable St. Andrews, New Brunswick. Edwin Ganong died in Toronto in 1944 and his wife died the following year. References * Craigs, Melodie. Ganong, The Candy Family (1984) Literacy Council of Fredericton * Folster, David.

It was completed in 1929 to the composer's own libretto; its plot is drawn from author's native Vala≈°sko. The opera is written in prose.  Background  After H√°ba successfully resolved instrumental and theoretical problems with the quarter-tone system in the 1920s, he started to compose fully in that style. His work is bi-chromatic and in some folklore-inspired scenes and recitative parts of the score H√°ba approached to the intonational diction of the folk dialect. In spite of the folklore atmosphere of the work, its music is very independent and entirely original. The opera is strongly connected to Moravian ethnic traditions and takes advantage of local dialect and music. Daniel Albright describes it as, \\"a remarkable work: slightly in awe of its own daring, in that H√°ba seemed more fascinated by the quarter-tone scale themselves than by any melody that might be construed from them, and yet resolute in refusing to employ the small intervals in the expected way, as a resource for denoting pain and disorientation [ expressionism ],\\" instead H√°ba intended the opera as a peasant comedy in the tradition of Smetana's Bartered Bride (1866).Albright, Daniel. 2004.

He served as the bishop of the Diocese of Trenton, New Jersey (1934‚Äì40) and the Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, Wisconsin (1940‚Äì53). Early life and education Moses Kiley was born in Margaree, on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, to John and Margaret (n√©e McGarry) Kiley. He received his early education at a grade school in Baddeck, and moved to Somerville, Massachusetts, at age 16. He earned money to finance his higher education by working as an errand boy at a carriage shop in Somerville which his older brothers had established. He also worked as a floorwalker at a department store in Boston and as a trolley motorman. In 1903, Kiley enrolled at the College of St. Laurent in Montreal, Quebec. After three years in Montreal, he began his studies for the priesthood at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1906. The following year he was sent to continue his studies in Rome, where he resided at the Pontifical North American College. He earned a doctorate in philosophy from the University of St. Thomas in 1909, and a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical Urban University in 1911. Priesthood Kiley was ordained a priest in Rome on June 10, 1911. Following his return to the United States, he was assigned as a curate at St. Agnes Church in Chicago, Illinois, where he remained for five years. In 1916, he established the Mission of the Holy Cross for homeless men. That same year, he was named the first archdiocesan director of Catholic Charities, a post which he held until 1926. Kiley was elevated to the rank of Monsignor in 1924. From 1926 to 1934, he served as spiritual director of the Pontifical North American College in Rome. Episcopacy On February 10, 1934, Kiley was appointed the fifth Bishop of Trenton, New Jersey, by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration one month later, on March 17, from Cardinal Raffaele Rossi, with Cardinal Carlo Salotti and Archbishop Thomas Walsh serving as co-consecrators, at the Church of Santa Susanna in Rome. His most notable achievement in Trenton was refinancing $10,000,000 of church obligations. Following the transfer of Archbishop Samuel Stritch to the Archdiocese of Chicago, Kiley was appointed the sixth Archbishop of Milwaukee by Pope Pius XII on January 1, 1940. He was installed at the Church of the Gesu on the following March 28. During his tenure in Milwaukee, Kiley earned a reputation as a conservative leader and stern administrator. He oversaw an extensive renovation of the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist, which suffered major damage from a fire in 1935. He rebuilt the St. Aemillian Orphanage, which had also suffered major fire damage in the 1930s. He also renovated St. Francis Seminary, converted Pio Nono High School into a minor seminary, and created a Catholic Family Life Bureau in 1948. Kiley died at St. Mary's Hospital in Milwaukee, at age 76.

In addition to being home to the village government, police department, and until 2000 the public library, it has a public reading room in keeping with the requirements of the original land deed. A 432-seat theatre, used for many local gatherings such as school graduations, was also built on the second story. The Town Hall was built in 1902 from a design by local architect Albert J. Manning, an early use of the Colonial Revival architectural style for a civic building. The inside also features glasswork and mosaics by Louis Comfort Tiffany, whose father, Charles Lewis Tiffany, had an estate in the village. These two factors led to its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, and has also been a contributing property to the Irvington Historic District since 2014. Building The two-story brick building is seven bays square on a raised basement of randomly coursed stone. The facade is trimmed in terra cotta and stone. The former is used for the window lintels and sills as well as an intermediate cornice; the latter for the water table. It is topped with a shallow hipped roof that has some of its original metal sheathing. Clock tower detail At the second story of the front facade, there is a balustraded projecting portico three bays wide with freestanding engaged Ionic columns and Doric pilasters supporting a full entablature with denticulated pediment. It is in turn topped with a three- stage wooden clock tower with round-arched louvered openings, paired Corinthian columns supporting block entablatures and paired scroll brackets. The very top of Town Hall is the clock tower's domed roof. This feature has made the clock tower one of Irvington's most recognizable local landmarks. The main entrance uses an arched Gibbs-style surround. The building's trim materials show up in the form of solid stone balustrades that curl to form newel posts at the sidewalk, and terra cotta quoins. The rear facade is less detailed, with terra cotta used only for the coping of the stepped cornice; stone and brick are used everywhere else. Much of the interior is in paneled dark wood, with wainscoting in some rooms. In the library, the dark wood is used for ceiling beams with famous literary quotations inscribed in gold leaf. It is lit by chandeliers and lanterns designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany. Its plaster walls give way to a domed ceiling and display niches in the main area, with some open areas featuring decorative corbels. The theater features a complete orchestra and balcony section, with the private booths featuring round openings separated by Doric posts with Adamesque detail. The proscenium arch also includes heavy classical detailing. History The property where Town Hall now stands was first developed in 1869, when a local organization called the Mental and Moral Improvement Society built what it called the Atheneum, which housed a circulating library. During the last decades of the 19th century, the village grew rapidly, and by the 1890s needed a central place to house its various governmental functions. In 1892 the society conveyed the Atheneum property to the village with the condition that it maintain, in perpetuity, a library and reading room in the building and construct the building within five years. After the village had not been able to find a suitable architect by 1897, the society agreed to a five-year extension. Manning, a former office manager to New York City architect Robert Robertson, finally produced a design the village liked, and it was completed and opened in 1902, at the end of the extension. Financial assistance came from some of the village's wealthier residents. Frederick W. Guiteau, a member of the society, endowed the library with $10,000 which he had apparently originally intended to bequeath to it in his will.\\"Big Bequest to Cornell\\" New York Times (October 8, 1903) Helen Gould, who had grown up in the nearby Lyndhurst estate as the daughter of Jay Gould, contributed the cost of the interior finishings and made Tiffany's work possible. The Arts and Crafts furniture she bought is still in use. The new town hall became the center of Irvington's public life the village had envisioned. The theatre in particular was used for public events such as school graduation ceremonies, police and fire balls, plays and other cultural events. Eleanor Roosevelt spoke at a Democratic rally just before her husband was elected President in 1932. Opera singer Lillian Nordica performed there, and Ted Mack auditioned talent for his Original Amateur Hour there as well. In the mid-20th century, the library needed space and took over the stair area leading up to the theater. A tower was added to the rear exterior to compensate. After the state fire code was revised in the 1960s, however, the theatre no longer met those standards and could not be used as a public space. The library used it as storage space afterwards, with a few occasional public exhibitions, as it continued to deteriorate. In 1978, the Irvington Town Hall Theatre Group raised $100,000, mostly from the village, for the necessary improvements and restoration of earlier period details such as light fixtures. It reopened in late 1981 and has been in use ever since. By the 1990s the library was again in need of space, and had to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act requiring greater physical accessibility. It moved into another local historic structure, the Lord and Burnham Building on South Astor Street, but a reading room, the so-called \\"Tiffany Room\\", remains in the Town Hall, to fulfill the requirements of the original deed.

In 2002 two men were shot and killed at a party, allegedly by the defendant, Ian Davis. He was extradited from the United States and tried at the Central Criminal Court for two counts of murder in 2004. He was convicted by the jury and appealed. The decision of the House of Lords in June 2008 led to Parliament passing the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008 a month later. Trial Davis was charged with the murders of Ashley Kenton and Wayne Mowatt who had been present at a party in Hackney, East London, on the morning of January 1, 2002. Davis, although admitting being present at the party, claimed to have left before the shooting, and relied on an alibi defence. However, three prosecution witnesses identified Davis as the gunman. To protect their identity, the judge ordered that * they would be allowed to give evidence under pseudonyms * any details which might identify them were to be withheld from Davis and his legal advisers and they could not be asked any questions which might lead to their identification * they would be allowed to give evidence from behind screens and their voices disguised electronically. Davis' counsel, Malcolm Swift QC, objected to these restrictions but was overruled by the trial judge. Appeals Davis first appealed to the Court of Appeal on the basis that the judge's orders relating to the anonymity of witnesses were contrary to the common law and Article 6(3)(d) of the European Convention on Human Rights, and therefore Davis could not have received a fair trial. This contention was rejected and Davis' appeal dismissed. However the court did certify a point of law of general public importance: This permitted a further appeal to the House of Lords. The case was heard by five law lords. On 18 June 2008 they unanimously held that Davis had not had a fair trial, since his counsel had been unable to adequately challenge the prosecution evidence or test the reliability of the anonymous witnesses. Davis's defence had been that his ex-girlfriend had told lies about him to the police, or had persuaded other people to tell such lies on her behalf. Without being allowed to know if the anonymous witnesses knew Davis or his ex-girlfriend, and forbidden to ask any questions that might reveal who they were, defence counsel had been so hindered in his attempts to probe their evidence that Davis had not received a fair trial. The House reviewed all of the major cases in which anonymous witnesses had been allowed, and concluded that the law had developed incrementally in such a way that while no single step towards trials with anonymous witnesses had been obviously wrong, their cumulative effect had now gone too far. As Lord Brown put it: However the House did not go so far as to say that anonymous witnesses can never be used in a trial, and listed some examples where they would still be permitted. The effect of the judgement is that witnesses may not give evidence anonymously if to conceal their identity from the defendant and his lawyers would hinder cross-examination or other challenges to their credibility. (Also R v Davis does not affect the rules on concealing the identity of witnesses from the public but not from the defence.) Lord Mance concluded the judgement by saying:  Reaction  The reaction of the police to the decision was negative; John Yates, Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police described the decision as a cause for grave concern and said The Justice Secretary, Jack Straw, announced that there would be an immediate review of the law, with the possibility of legislation to reverse the principle established by the decision, and on 4 July 2008, the Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Bill was introduced in the House of Commons. The bill became law on 21 July 2008, 33 days after the Lords' ruling. Cases citedUnited States= *Kirby v. United States 174 US 47, 55 (1899) *Alford v. United States 282 US 687 (1931) *Pointer v.

History Around 1240, the first Schaffgotsch appears in a Silesian document as \\"Sibotho de nobili Familia Ovium\\" (\\"ovium\\" is the Latin word for \\"sheep\\", the translation of the German word Schaf(f)). According to tradition, Sibotho came in the entourage of Hedwig of Andechs and Henry I the Bearded. Kynast (Chojnik) Castle One of Sibotho's successors, the knight Gotsche II Schoff (who died in 1420), bought extensive possessions in the foreland of the Riesengebirge Giant Mountains and Iser Jizera Mountains at the end of the fourteenth century: the Kynast and Greiffenstein dominions. The Schaffgotsch family thus became the most important noble family in the Jelenia G√≥ra Valley (Hirschberger Tal). In 1403, Gotsche II donated the church at Warmbrunn to the Cistercian provost. His family cherished the memory of Gotsche II Schoff, the originator of their wealth, by adopting the sobriquet \\"Gotsch\\". Later, both names were connected as Schaffgotsch. Gotsche II's son Hans (who died in 1469) was the first of the family to be chancellor, court judge, and governor () of the Principality of ≈öwidnica-Jawor (Schweidnitz-Jauer). With his sons Anton, Kaspar, and Ulrich, the Schaffgotsch family split into three branches. Anton (who died in 1508) established the Bohemian branch, whose Seifersdorf and Kreppelhof-Reu√üendorf- Ullersdorf lines died out in the seventeenth century. This branch became Bohemian barons in 1674 and counts in 1681. The most notable members of the branch were Christoph Wilhelm (1687‚Äì1768), who was Landeshauptmann (governor) of Silesia; Johann Ernst Anton (1685‚Äì1768); senior burgrave of Prague; Johann Prokop (1748‚Äì1813), bishop of Budweis (now ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice); and Anton Ernst (1804‚Äì70), bishop of Br√ºnn (now Brno). The branch, which until 1945 resided chiefly in eastern Bohemia, died out in 1993. The branch established by Hans's son Ulrich (1453‚Äì1543) ceased to exist in 1661; Christoph (1552‚Äì1601), grandson of Kaspar (1476‚Äì1534), had already succeeded to Ulrich's domain of Greiffenstein as early as 1578. Christoph, a Protestant, was the first ancestor of the Silesian branch of the family, which in 1766 split into the lines of Kynast-Warmbrunn and Wildsch√ºtz; Wildsch√ºtz, which resided in Austrian Silesia, died out in the first half of the twentieth century. Hans Ulrich von Schaffgotsch (1595‚Äì1635) Christoph's son, Hans Ulrich (1595‚Äì1635), a Protestant like his father, was the only Schaffgotsch who married into a dynastic house: his wife, Barbara Agnes was a princess of Liegnitz Brieg (a descendant of the House of Ascania through her mother, Princess Anna Marie of Anhalt-Zerbst, who was the daughter of Joachim Ernst, Duke of Anhalt; through her father, Barbara Agnes descended from dukes of Silesia and from W≈Çadys≈Çaw II the ExileDuchess Barbara Agnes von Schlesien-Liegnitz) Hans Ulrich received all rights of a Silesian sovereign and was awarded the title Semperfrei by the Holy Roman emperor. As an imperial general, he served under Wallenstein but signed the first Pilsen Revers, which the emperor considered a betrayal. Hans Ulrich was beheaded and the family were deprived of all their possessions; his son Christoph Leopold (1632‚Äì1703) converted to Roman Catholicism and recovered all estates except Trachenberg. In 1654, Christoph Leopold became a count and was made imperial legate in Poland. In 1683, he accompanied John III Sobieski at the Battle of Vienna as the ambassador of the emperor. He was court tutor and court judge in Schweidnitz and Jauer, and chamber president and upper governor (German: Oberlandeshauptmann) of Silesia. His son Johann Anton Gotthard (1665‚Äì1742), created an imperial count (German: Reichsgraf), was director of the Silesian district authority (German: Oberamt). After Kynast Castle had burnt down, struck by lightning in 1675, the family moved to nearby Warmbrunn Castle, an early 17th century renaissance building. It also burnt down in 1777 and was replaced from 1784 with a large neoclassicism palace which remained the main residence of the head of the family until 1945. Philipp Gotthard von Schaffgotsch (1715‚Äì1795), Bishop of Breslau After the Prussian capture of Silesia, Philipp Gotthard von Schaffgotsch (1715‚Äì1795) became bishop of Breslau, proposed by Frederick the Great who also made him a prince. When, during the Seven Years' War, the bishop went into exile in Bohemia, the king banned him for lifetime from returning. In the following generation, Johann Nepomuk Gotthard (1732‚Äì1808) received the title of \\"Erblandhofmeister\\". The family gained a seat in the Prussian House of Lords. In the first half of the nineteenth century, the family again split, into the Lower Silesian line of Warmbrunn-Kynast and the Upper Silesian of Koppitz. Due to the hot springs at Warmbrunn the counts built a spa house and a theater in the early 19th century which became a fashionable retreat. When the Cistercian provost that Gotsche II Schoff had founded at Warmbrunn in 1381 was secularized in 1810, it became owned by the comital family and housed their 80,000 volume library and other collections. Count Hans Ulrich von Schaffgotsch (1831‚Äì1915) had married Johanna Gryczik in 1858, the adopted daughter and sole heir of zinc mine industrialist Karl Godulla and thus became one of the most important industrialists in Prussia. Their descendants, the Upper Silesian line, or Koppitz branch of the family, owned this huge business empire until 1945. The Lower Silesian line, with its large possessions in and around the Riesen- and Iser Gebirge (Giant and Jesera Mountains), was considered the second wealthiest family of the region before World War I. In the 1930s, the last lord of the Warmbrunn-Kynast estate, Friedrich (1883‚Äì1947), owned 27,668 hectares, the sixth largest enterprise in Prussia. In 1923 Anna Schaffgotsch inherited Niederleis Castle in Lower Austria, which is still owned by her descendants. In 1935, Averell Harriman, chairman of the Union Pacific Railroad, tasked Felix von Schaffgotsch (of Austria) with finding a location for a Union Pacific \\"resort investment\\" in the western United States. In January 1936, Felix notified Harriman that he had found a location outside Ketchum, Idaho, that would soon become the site of Union Pacific's Sun Valley Resort. During the resort's construction, he returned to Austria to recruit instructors for the Sun Valley ski school, who he confided to actor David Niven were, \\"all Nazis.\\" Felix Schaffgotsch returned to the U.S. in time for the resort's opening, and remained a central figure in Sun Valley's early development. He returned to Europe after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1939, and entered the German Army. It's reported that he died on the Russian Front during World War II. After World War II, most members of the Schaffgotsch family were expelled from their homes because they were ethnic Germans, and the Communists confiscated their properties.

It was founded in 1981 by students from Bretton Hall College in Wakefield. The company was based in Wakefield and Castleford before moving to York in 2001. The company is now based at York Theatre Royal. It tours work in the UK and internationally. The previous Artistic Director, Marcus Romer, who has written, directed, and shaped the identity of the company since 1995 recently moved on to establish Arts Beacon. As of July 2016, the company artistic direction will be led by Esther Richardson. In 1998 Pilot Theatre embarked on their first mid-scale UK tour with their production of Lord of the Flies, which went on to win the company numerous awards and great critical acclaim. Since then the company has developed links with theatres around the country, in particular York Theatre Royal where they are now residents. They were part of the EU Culture 2000 funded programme called Magic-Net along with twelve other countries across Europe and in 2009 they became the UK partner for the European project, Platform 11+, which engaged 13 theatres in 12 European countries to create new pieces of theatre for 11 to 15 year olds. This has opened the door for international touring and collaborations. In 2011 the company toured to Milan, Dresden and Argentina and in 2012 hosted companies from around the EU at a week-long event in York as well as visiting the Czech Republic. They produced the International Indian Film Academy Awards opening sequence for stage and TV in 2007 at Sheffield Arena. This was in partnership with their new collaborators Kit Monkman and Tom Wexler from KMA who are also based in York. Pilot Theatre have also become strong advocates for using digital technologies within the arts. This has grown through their annual hosting of the Shift Happens conference, which explored new digital technologies and possible uses for them within the arts sector. In 2011 Pilot Theatre hosted the first ever TEDx York event in conjunction with Science City York. Working with online video experts Kinura, Pilot Theatre delivered the multi-channel livestream of the world-famous York Mystery Plays in August 2012 as part of their involvement in the BBC and Arts Council England funded project The Space. Their dedication and commitment to exploring new ways of engaging young people in the arts and new ways to use technology in the arts has allowed the company the ability to adapt to the changing world and constantly offer a product that is relevant and exciting for their audiences. Pilot Theatre and York Theatre Royal presented Alan Sillitoe's, The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner adapted for the stage by Roy Williams which premiered in York before a national tour in Autumn 2012. In 2014, we worked with Roy Williams again on an adaptation of Antigone in co-production with Derby Theatre and Stratford East. In the same year we began a large scale cooperation project funded by the European Commission under their European Culture Funding Stream Creative Europe. This project, entitled PLATFORM shift+, consists of 11 partners from 9 countries - ten theatres and a university - all working towards meeting the new challenges of producing theatre for young people in the digital age. As one of the UK's most renowned companies in delivering performance work for young people and exploring innovative approaches to making and sharing work, Pilot Theatre is the leading organisation. Continuing Pilot's history of International work, in 2014 they began work on the Boomerang - Documents of Poverty and Hope project. This is one of 12 successful projects being run by the European Commission under their Cooperation project with Third Countries - European Culture Funding Stream. Pilot Theatre is working with five other theatres; the Australian Theatre for Young People, Sydney; Dynamo Theatre, Montreal; Presentation House Theatre, Vancouver; Elsinor Theatre, Milan; and O Bando Theatre, Portugal, on the issue of migration and its impact on young people across continents. The company has won three Manchester Evening News awards for Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, adapted by Nigel Williams, and Beautiful Thing, by Jonathan Harvey. Other work includes Sing yer heart out for the lads, by Roy Williams, Road by Jim Cartwright, Bloodtide by Melvin Burgess, The Beauty Queen of Leenane by Martin McDonagh, Kiss of the Spider Woman by Manuel Puig, Mirad a Boy from Bosnia by Ad de Bont, Rumble Fish by S.E. Hinton, Look Back In Anger by John Osborne, The Elephant Man by Bernard Pomerance, Fungus the Bogeyman by Raymond Briggs, The Twits by Roald Dahl and Looking for JJ and Antigone. They won the Manchester Evening News Award for best production for their tour of Lord of the Flies in 2001. The production was revived and a tour took place in 2008. Pilot Theatre have embraced new technologies both on and off stage. They built their production of Looking for JJ on MySpace and have the first UK Theatre hub in Second Life.

In 2008 it continues to operate as part of the Conwy Valley Line.Baughan 1980, pages 116-118  History Proposals= As early as 1846, the Chester and Holyhead Railway (CHR) planned a branch from its mainline at Conway along the Conwy valley to Llanrwst. Although this plan did not result in a railway, in 1853 a proposal for the Conway and Llanrwst Railway was laid before Parliament. This first bill was withdrawn following a proposal for an alternative route from the CHR. A third attempt for a railway along the valley came from the engineer Edmund Sharpe who worked for the CHR. He proposed a narrow gauge line of gauge along the west side of the valley. This proposal was rejected by the CHR in 1858. Sharpe then joined the promoters of the original Conway and Llanrwst Railway who at a second attempt gained official approval for their railway in July 1860.Baughan 1980, pages 116-117 =Construction= Construction of the railway began in August 1860. By this time the CHR had become part of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), and the board of the LNWR decided to purchase the Conway and Llanrwst Railway Company and run the railway as a branch of their main line to Holyhead.

Soon after the event, Pope John Paul II offered to mediate and sent his personal envoy, Cardinal Antonio Samor√©, to Buenos Aires. Argentina, in acceptance of the authority of the Pope over the overwhelmingly Catholic Argentine population, called off the military operation and accepted the mediation. On 9 January 1979, Chile and Argentina signed the Act of Montevideo formally requesting mediation by the Vatican and renouncing the use of force.  Interests of the parties  The mediator acted to defuse the situation by negotiating an agreement that stopped the immediate military crisis. Then the Vatican crafted a six-year process that allowed the parties to grapple with increasingly difficult issues, including navigation rights, sovereignty over other islands in the Fuegian Archipelago, delimitation of the Straits of Magellan, and maritime boundaries south to Cape Horn and beyond. * Chile considered the Arbitral Award of 1977 \\"‚Ä¶fully operative and obligatory in law‚Ä¶\\" as expressed by the Court of Arbitration after the Argentine Refusal.See \\"Der Schiedsspruch in der Beagle-Kanal-Streitigkeit\\", Karin Oellers-Frahm, Page 353 * Argentina repudiated the International Arbitral Award that the government of Alejandro Lanusse had solicited in 1971. * Argentina extended its claim to all territories southward of Tierra del Fuego and eastward of the Cape Horn- meridian. That is, Argentina claimed the islands Horn, Wollastone, Deceit, Barnevelt, Evouts, Herschell, etc. The 1978 military mobilization revealed other latent international relations issues between the two countries that had been previously overlooked or ignored.  Mediator  By the beginning of November 1978, Chile and Argentina no longer had any mechanism for working toward a peaceful settlement and the situation began to destabilize rapidly. It was at this point, with direct talks dead and a judicial settlement refused by Argentina, that Chile suggested mediation. Argentina accepted the proposal and the two foreign ministers agreed to meet in Buenos Aires on 12 December for the purpose of selecting a mediator and the terms of mediation. Possible candidates wereSee Alejandro Luis Corbacho: Predicting the Probability of War During Brinkmanship Crises: The Beagle and the Malvinas Conflicts, Universidad del CEMA, Argentina, Documento de Trabajo No. 244, September 2003, page 8 * Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, * the Organization of American States, * Juan Carlos I of Spain, King of Spain, * a European president, * Pope John Paul II. The ministers concurred on the issue that the Pope should mediate the dispute, but their agreement proved ephemeral. In the evening, as the Chilean delegation was studying the documents for signature, the Argentine minister called the Chilean minister Cubillos to tell him that President Videla, who had approved their choice of mediator, had been stripped of his authority by the junta. On 22 December 1978, Argentina launched Operation Soberania to occupy the islands militarily. On the morning of 22 December, Pope John Paul II, on his own initiative, contacted both governments directly to communicate that he was sending a personal envoy to Buenos Aires and Santiago.

In this treaty the parties agreed to: * no restrictions whatsoever over the mediation (textual: \\"‚Ä¶they will raise no objection to the expression by the Holy See, during these proceedings, of such ideas as its thorough studies on a disputed aspects of the problem of the southern zone may suggest to it, with a view to contributing to a peaceful settlement acceptable to both Parties‚Ä¶\\") * \\"‚Ä¶Antonio Cardinal Samor√© ‚Ä¶ asks that that request [of mediation] should be accompanied by an undertaking that the two States will not resort to the use of force in their mutual relations, will bring about a gradual return to the military situation existing at the beginning of 1977 and will refrain from adopting measures that might impair harmony in any sector.‚Ä¶\\".

The four phases of the mediation  Mark LaudyMark Laudy, \\"The Vatican Mediation of the Beagle Channel Dispute: Crisis Intervention and Forum Building\\" sees four phases during the mediation: * The first phase was the shortest and most critical period of the entire mediation and began with Samor√®'s arrival in Buenos Aires on 25 December 1978. This was purely a crisis intervention to prevent a war and secure an agreement to submit the matter to mediation. In a shuttle diplomacy, Samor√® flew between Santiago de Chile and Buenos Aires until the objectives were achieved with the signing of the Act of Montevideo on 8 January 1979. * The second period ran from May 1979, when the Chilean and Argentine delegations arrived in Rome, through December 1980, when the Pope presented the parties with his proposal for settling the dispute. This first proposal was rejected by Argentina. * The third and longest phase, running from the beginning of 1981 until December 1983, after Argentina's return to democracy, was characterized by long periods of stalled negotiations. The most significant developments during this period were the Argentine repudiation of the 1972 General Treaty; the subsequent effort to fill the juridical vacuum resulting from that repudiation; and the Falklands war, which set the stage for the return to democracy in Argentina. * The final phase began when Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n assumed the presidency in Buenos Aires at the end of 1983 and ended with the signing of the 1984 Treaty of Peace and Friendship.  The papal proposal of 1980  The papal proposal of 1980. On 12 December 1980, the Pope received both delegations and communicated to them his proposal for resolving the controversy, the terms of which had been developed entirely in secret and should be kept secret in order to avoid debilitating public debate that might diminish confidence in the proceedings and limit the freedom of action of both governments. But on 22 August 1981 the Argentine newspaper La Naci√≥n published the terms of the proposal. Chile would retain all of the islands and Argentina would be entitled to maintain certain limited facilities (common radar and weather stations) on some islands and would receive important navigation rights. Most important, however, was the creation of an ocean area known as the Sea of Peace. In this area, extending to the east and southeast from the disputed chain of islands, Chilean territorial waters would be limited to a narrow territorial sea, in which it would be obliged to share with Argentina equal participation in resource exploitation, scientific investigation, and environmental management. Beyond the Chilean territorial waters would be a much broader band of ocean subject to Argentine jurisdiction, but also subject to the same sharing provisions that applied in Chilean waters. Chile accepted the papal proposal, despite some reservations. Argentina never formally replied to the proposal. However, on 17 March 1981, Argentina delivered a note to the Vatican expressing grave misgivings about the proposal, both because it failed to award any islands to Argentina and because it allowed Chile to maintain a presence so far into the Atlantic.  Argentina renounced a 1972 Arbitration treaty  On 21 January 1982, Argentina announced the withdrawal from the 1972 bilateral treaty providing for recourse to the International Court of Justice in case of disputes. In Argentina, the judicial process had become an anathema, particularly in view of the adverse 1977 arbitration award.See Michael Morris, \\"The Strait of Magellan\\", Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1989, page 85 Chile reserved the right to go to the ICJ unilaterally before the treaty ended on 27 December 1982.See article Argentina denuncia el tratado con Chile sobre el Beagle in Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s on 23 January 1982 (in Spanish).  To the Falklands war  After the papal proposal, negotiations remained stalled and meanwhile, a sequence of incidents in Chile and Argentina strained relations between the two countries. On 28 April 1981, General Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri (then Argentine army chief; later, during the Falklands war, President of Argentina) closed the border to Chile without any consultation with his own president.See article Historia de la santa mediaci√≥n in Argentine newspaper Clar√≠n, Buenos Aires, on 20 December 1998: ¬´Me calent√©, se justific√≥ Galtieri ante el fastidiado comandante de la Marina, almirante Lambruschini, quien le pregunt√≥: Pero se da usted cuenta que el pa√≠s se encuentra as√≠ envuelto en una peligrosa escalada?¬ª (Translation; I lost my cool, justify himself Galtieri, as the annoyed Chief of the Argentine Navy, Admiral Lambruschini, asked him: Don't you notice that it bring the country in a dangerous escalation?) In March 1982, five weeks before the beginning of the Falklands war, a ship of the Argentine navy, ARA Francisco de Gurruchaga, anchored at the Deceit island, de facto under Chilean sovereignty since 1881, and refused to abandon the bay, despite Chilean demands.See article Pinochet ordena el acuartelamiento de las tropas chilenas por el conflicto con Argentina sobre el canal de Beagle in Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s on 6 March 1982 (in Spanish).William Ben Hunt, Getting to war: predicting international conflict with mass media indicators, page 22 On 2 April 1982, Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. The Argentine plan included indeed the military occupation of the disputed islands at the Beagle channel after the invasion of the Falklands, as stated by Brigadier Basilio Lami Dozo, chief of the Argentine Air Force during the Falklands war, in an interview with the Argentine magazine Perfil: L.F. Galtieri: \\"[Chile] have to know that what we are doing now, because they will be the next in turn.\\"Argentine magazine Perfil on 22 November 2009: :Para colmo, Galtieri dijo en un discurso: \\"Que saquen el ejemplo de lo que estamos haciendo ahora porque despu√©s les toca a ellos\\". √ìscar Camili√≥n, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Argentina from 29 March 1981 to 11 December 1981, in his \\"Memorias Pol√≠ticas\\", confirms the plan of the Argentine military: \\"The military planning was, with the Falklands in Argentine hands, to invade the disputed islands in the Beagle Channel. That was the determination of the [Argentine] navy‚Ä¶\\".Editorial Planeta, Buenos Aires, 1999, page 281¬´Los planes militares eran, en la hip√≥tesis de resolver el caso Malvinas, invadir las islas en disputa en el Beagle.

Argentine General Osiris Villegas, first chief of the Argentine delegation in Rom asked to stop negotiations with Chile and to seize the islands in April 1982, after the seize of the Falklands. In his book La propuesta pontificia y el espacio nacional comprometido, page 2, he called to: :no persistir en una diplomacia bilateral que durante a√±os la ha inhibido para efectuar actos de posesi√≥n efectiva en las islas en litigio que son los hechos reales que garantizan el establecimiento de una soberan√≠a usurpada y la preservaci√≥n de la integridad del territorio nacional. (cited in A treinta a√±os de la crisis del Beagle, Desarrollo de un modelo de negociaci√≥n en la resoluci√≥n del conflicto by Renato Valenzuela Ugarte and Fernando Garc√≠a Toso, in Chilean Magazine \\"Pol√≠tica y Estrategia\\", nr. 115) Pope John Paul II made an unscheduled visit to Buenos Aires on 14 June 1982, in an attempt to prevent further hostilities between Britain and Argentina. Chile became the only major Latin American country to support Britain indirectly by providing a military and naval diversion, but \\"in private many [Latin American] governments were pleased with the outcome of the war\\".See K.J. Holsti, \\"The state, war, and the state of war\\", page 176  The final phase  After the war, yet despite the renewal of the 1972 Treaty on 15 September 1982, the distension after ARA- Gurruchaga incident and the spy-exchanging, the mediation continued to move very slowly. Following the war Chile evinced a greater willingness to negotiate modifications to the papal proposal, but by then it had become clear that the Argentine junta, reeling from its defeat in the war, was too weak to achieve an agreement. Cardinal Antonio Samor√® died in Rome at age 77, in February 1983. President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n's new government was firmly committed to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible. Based on this commitment and additional discussions, the parties were able to lay much of the groundwork for a settlement. In April 1984, Vatican Secretary of State Agostino Casaroli asked separately the two delegations for their proposals for a final solution. By October 1984, both countries reached a complete understanding, and the revised text of the treaty was finalized on 18 October. Chile accepted, again, the papal proposal. In Argentina, Alfonsin held a consultative referendum. The official returns showed 10,391,019 voted in favor of the proposed treaty while 2,105,663 opposed it, a margin of 82 percent to 16 percent opposed, with 2 percent casting blank or null ballots.See article Beagle Channel Treaty Approved in Argentina in USA-newspaper The New York Times on 26 November 1984 The Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina went a long way before enacted: * on 30 December 1984, the treaty passed the Argentine Chamber of Deputies; * on 15 March 1985, the treaty passed the Argentine Senate; * on 16 March 1985, the treaty was signed by representative of the President of Argentina, who was abroad; * on 11 April 1985, the treaty passed the Chilean junta; * on 12 April 1985, the treaty was signed by Augusto Pinochet; * on 2 May 1985, both ministers exchanged instruments.

Although Denmark is unincorporated, it has a post office with the ZIP code of 52624, that opened on April 7, 1846.Zip Code Lookup The community is part of the Fort Madison-Keokuk, IA-MO Micropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2010 Census the population of Denmark was 423. Denmark was laid out circa 1837. History In 1836, four families emigrated from the town and church of New Ipswich, NH to Denmark in what was then Wisconsin Territory, now in Iowa. Within a short time they were followed by eight other families. They all carried with them the same standard of right living and wise planning for the best interest of those who should come after them that they had known in New Ipswich. Those who \\"laid out the town of Denmark, which is three-fourths of a mile square, into town lots for building, donated one-half of those lots to the purpose of Education.\\" In the building of a church and of an academy they followed as closely as possible the example set by the founders of New Ipswich. The church set up by the settlers is the oldest Congregational church in Iowa. They were early known as champions of freedom. \\"Under the leadership of their pastor, Rev. Asa Turner, they joined with others in the election of Governor Grimes in 1854, which changed the political history of Iowa and gave birth to the Republican party in the nation.\\" Dr. Turner and Rev. Mr. Lee were classmates at Yale College and lifelong friends. His pastorate continued for thirty years; and his influence led to Iowa the eleven young men from Andover Seminary who formed the \\"Iowa Band,\\" one of whom, their historian, was Rev. Ephraim Adams, a son of New Ipswich. Education The Fort Madison Community School District serves Denmark, operating Lincoln and Richardson elementary schools, Fort Madison Middle School, and Fort Madison High School. Previously the district operated Denmark Elementary School in Denmark; in 1998 the school had about 305 students. It originated from the establishment of Denmark Academy in 1845. The original building was destroyed in a fire circa 1924. The district decided to demolish Denmark Elementary in 2012. Ken Marang, the superintendent, stated that the \\"outdated\\" building had problems with mold and water leakage and that the fact that \\"doors open out into the hallways\\" made it \\"unsafe\\". Circa 2013 some residents were calling for the school to be dismantled and the land given to the community.
