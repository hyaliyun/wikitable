Geography Gumel is located 120 km northeast of Kano, and lies about 20 km south of Nigeria's northern border with Niger. As of 2007 the estimated population of Gumel was 44,158. History The emirate was founded about 1750 by Dan Juma of Kano and his followers from the Mangawa tribe. Shortly after his death in 1754, it became a tributary state of the Bornu kingdom. The emirate survived the Fulani attacks of Usman dan Fodio's jihad in the early 19th century and never became part of the Fulani empire of Sokoto. The present-day location of Gumel is the result of an 1845 move from the city of Tumbi, located in what is now Niger. The emirate has frequently been at war with the nearby cities of Hadejia, Danzomo, Kano, and Zinder since 1828. The war with Hadejia continued until the death of Gumel's emir, Abdullahi, in 1872. Before Emir Ahmadu accepted British rule in 1903, frequent slave raids from the town of Zinder were common. In 1976 Gumel became part of Kano State, and since 1991 it has been part of Jigawa State near Danzomo, Gagarawa, Sule Tankarkar, and Maigatari. The current emir of Gumel, HRH Alh. Ahmed Mohammed Sani II (CON) is the 16th emir of Gumel. The emir is a graduate, in political science, of Ohio State University in the United States. He has a younger brother, Abdullahi Muhammad Sani II, who is a graduate of Michigan State University in the United States, with a major in electrical engineering. The emir has been in office since 1981. The emir's palace is accessible only to those invited there by the emir, to members of the royal family, and to officials of the royal court (the emirate council, also called the Majlis). =The Gumel Emirate family tree= Emirs * 1749 - 1754 Dan Juma I dan Musa * 1754 - 1760 Adamu Karro dan Digadiga Karro (d. 1760) * 1760 - 1777 Dan Juma II dan Digadiga Karro * 1777 - 1804 Maikota dan Adam Karro (d. 1804) * 1804 - 1811 Kalgo dan Maikota (d. 1811) * 1811 - 1828 Dan Auwa dan Maikota (d. 1828) * 1828 - 1851 Muhamman Dan Tanoma dan Maikota (d. 1851) * 1851 - 1853 Ceri dan Muhamman Dan Tanoma (1st time) * 1853 - 1855 Muhamman Atu dan Dan Auwa * 1855 - 1861 Ceri dan Muhamman Dan Tanoma (2nd time) * 1861 - 1872 \`Abd Allahi dan Muhamman Dan Tanoma (d. 1872) * 1872 - 1896 Abu Bakar dan Muhamman Dan Tanoma (d. 1896) * 1896 - 1915 Ahmadu dan Abi Bakar * 1915 - 1944 Muhamman na Kota dan Ahmadu (d. 1944) * May 1944 - 1981 Maina Muhammad Sani II dan Muhamman na Kota (b. 1912) * 1981 - Ahmad Muhammad Sani II dan Maina Muhammad Sani II Economy Gumel acts as the region's primary economic center.

Medieval Croatian states Croatian principalities = The first mention of Croatian military actions dates from the time of the Croatian principalities in the 8th and 9th centuries. Vojnomir of Pannonian Croatia led a Croatian army in wars against the Avars at the end of the 8th century. He launched a joint counterattack with the help of Frankish troops under Charlemagne in 791. The offensive was successful and the Avars were driven out of what then became Pannonian Croatia under Frankish overlords. In 819, his successor Duke Ljudevit Posavski raised a rebellion against the Franks. Ljudevit won many battles against the Franks, but in 822 his forces were defeated. Prince Borna of Croatia led the army of Dalmatian Croatia and had a primary role in crushing Ljudevit's rebellion. Borna reported his successes to the Frankish Emperor, stating that Ljudevit had lost over 3,000 soldiers and 300 horses during his campaign. Prince Trpimir I of Croatia battled successfully against his neighbours, the Byzantine coastal cities under the strategos of Zadar in 846‚Äì848. In 853 he repulsed an attack from an Army of the Bulgarian Khan Boris I and concluded a peace treaty with him, exchanging gifts. Prince Domagoj of Croatia is known in the history for his navy which helped the Franks to conquer Bari from the Arabs in 871. During Domagoj's reign piracy was a common practice, which earned him a title of The worst duke of Slavs (). One of the strongest Croatian princes was Branimir, whose naval fleet defeated the Venetian navy on 18 September 887. =Kingdom of Croatia= Hungarians arrival into the Carpathian Basin. The Hungarian incursion into Croatia was repelled at the Battle of Drava River. First Croatian king Tomislav defeated the Magyar mounted invasions of the Arpads in battle and forced them across the Drava River. In 927 Tomislav's army heavily defeated the army of Bulgarian Emperor Simeon, under the command of general Alogobotur in the Battle of the Bosnian Highlands. One of Tomislav's admirals lead more than 5,000 sailors, soldiers and their families into Slavic quarter of Palermo, Sicily. At the peak of his reign, according to Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos' De Administrando Imperio, written around 950, Tomislav could raise a vast military force composed out of 100,000 infantrymen and 60,000 horsemen and a sizable fleet of 80 large ships and 100 smaller vessels. According to the palaeographic analysis of the original manuscript of De Administrando Imperio, the estimation of the number of inhabitants in medieval Croatia between 440 and 880 thousand people, and military numbers of Franks and Byzantines - the Croatian military force was most probably composed of 20,000-100,000 infantrymen, and 3,000-24,000 horsemen organized in 60 allagions. King Dmitar Zvonimir of Croatia took the hard line against the Byzantine Empire and joined the Normansin wars against Byzantium. When Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia, invaded the western Balkan provinces of the empire in 1084, Zvonimir sent troops to his aid. King Petar Svaƒçiƒá's troops maintained resistance against repelling Hungarian assaults at Mount Gvozd in the war for the succession of the Croatian throne. At the end, the last native Croatian king was defeated and killed by King Coloman of Hungary in the Battle of Gvozd Mountain (1097). =Notable wars and battles of early medieval times= Notable wars and battles that included Croatian army: *Siege of Trsat (799) *Battle of Kupa (819) *Battle of Drava River (925) *Croatian-Bulgarian wars **Battle of the Bosnian Highlands (926) Depiction of King Petar Svaƒçiƒá's death at the Battle of Gvozd Mountain.

During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, Jelaƒçiƒá's forces supported the armies of the Austrian Empire. At the end of the first half of the 19th century, following in the wake of the French revolution, Croatian romantic nationalism emerged to counteract the non- violent but apparent Germanization and Magyarization. By the 1840s, and during the revolutions of 1848, the movement had moved from cultural goals to resisting Hungarian political demands which grew even bigger during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Croatian Ban Josip Jelaƒçiƒá cooperated with the Austrians in quenching the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 by leading a military campaign into Hungary. *Battles of the Hungarian Revolution involving Croats: **Battle of P√°kozd (1848) **Vienna Uprising (1848) **Battle of Schwechat (1848) **Battle of M√≥r (1848) Croatian troops also contributed in other conflicts which involved the Austrian Empire.

The State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs was formed from the southernmost parts of the Austria-Hungary but it lasted for only a month. After it was clear that Austria-Hungary had lost World War I, the Austrian government decided to give much of the Austro-Hungarian Navy fleet, to the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. This move would have avoided handing the fleet to the Allies, since the new state had declared neutrality. Soon, the Fleet was attacked and dismembered by the Italian Regia Marina and the flagship SMS Viribus Unitis was sunk along with his captain and commander of Navy of the newly formed state, admiral Janko Vukoviƒá. =World War II= partisans during the Second World War.

It appeared that the captain, Duleep Mendis, had little faith in him, and he never returned to international cricket. Shortly afterwards, he joined an unofficial Sri Lankan tour of South Africa in 1982-83, which led to a ban from international cricket and cricket in Sri Lanka. In the first of the two unofficial Tests he took 5 for 123 in South Africa's only innings, which were the Sri Lankan team's best figures of the tour.

It is a reinforced concrete open-spandrel arch bridge. The bridge is south of San Francisco and south of Carmel in Monterey County along State Route 1. Before the opening of the bridge in 1932, residents of the Big Sur area were virtually cut off during winter due to blockages on the often impassable Old Coast Road, which led inland. The bridge was built under budget for $199,861 (equivalent to $ in dollars) and, at , was the longest concrete arch span on the California State Highway System. When it was completed, it was the highest single-span arch bridge in the world, and it remains one of the tallest. The land north and south of the bridge was privately owned until 1988 and 2001. A logging company obtained approval to harvest redwood on the former Bixby Ranch to the north in 1986, and in 2000 a developer obtained approval to subdivide the former Brazil Ranch to the south. Local residents and conservationists fought their plans, and both pieces of land were eventually acquired by local and federal government agencies. After a $20 million seismic retrofit completed in 1996, the bridge remains functionally obsolete. Its width does not meet modern standards requiring bridges to be wide.  Location  The bridge is \\"one of the most photographed features on the West Coast\\" and in the world. It has been featured on \\"postcards, TV ads, everywhere,\\" according to Debra Geiler, project manager for the Trust for Public Land. The bridge's location on the scenic Central Coast of California, the parabolic shape of the arch, the tall spandrel columns, and the architectural piers contribute to an \\"intense aesthetic experience.\\" \\"It's the gateway to Big Sur and the interior has never been logged. The land is pristine.\\" Zad Leavy, former executive director of the Big Sur Land Trust, described the land as \\"...the most spectacular meeting of ocean and land in the entire United States.\\"  Characteristics  The bridge is in total length and wide, with of clearance below, and has a main span of , which places 50% of the total roadbed above the arch. The arch ribs are five feet thick at the deck and nine feet thick at the springing line, where they join the towers at their base. The arches are four and one-half feet wide. The bridge was designed to support more than six times its intended load. The two large, vertical buttresses or supporting pillars on either side of the arch, while aesthetically pleasing, are functionally unnecessary. Engineers of later arch bridges such as the Frederick W. Panhorst Bridge omitted them from the design. The Rocky Creek Bridge and the Malpaso Creek Bridge to the north are also open-spandrel arch bridges built of reinforced concrete.  Construction  The state first began building Route 56, or the Carmel-San Simeon Highway, in 1919. A number of bridges needed to be constructed, the largest among them across Bixby Creek. = Bridge design = Bixby Creek Bridge under construction, 1932 State engineers considered two alternatives to crossing the creek, an inland route and a smaller bridge, or a coastal location and a larger bridge. The inland route would have needed an 890-foot (270 m) tunnel cut through the Santa Lucia Mountains to a 250-foot (76 m) bridge upstream. The engineers selected the coastal route because it was safer, more scenic, and least affected the environment. California state highway engineer C. H. Purcell and bridge engineer and designer F. W. Panhorst considered whether to build a steel or concrete span. A steel bridge would cost more to build and maintain, as the sea air would require expensive ongoing maintenance and painting. A steel bridge was also less in keeping with the natural environment. Using concrete reduced material costs and allowed more of the total cost to be paid to workers, which was a positive aspect of the design during the Depression. They chose concrete in part because it would not only reduce both construction and maintenance costs but would also echo the color and composition of the natural rock cliff formations in the area. The state awarded a contract for $203,334 to the lower bidder, Ward Engineering Company of San Francisco, on August 13, 1931. Construction began on August 24, 1931. = Design and materials = An aerial view of the Bixby Creek Bridge showing the curved approaches at both ends Over 300,000 board feet (700 m3) of Douglas fir timber, used to build a 250-foot (76 m) high falsework to support the arch during construction, was transported from the railroad terminal in Monterey over the narrow, one-way road to the bridge site. The falsework, built by crews led by E. C. Panton, the general superintendent, and I. O. Jahlstrom, resident engineer of Ward Engineering Co., was difficult to raise, because it was constantly exposed to high winds. Some of the falsework timbers were . It took two months to construct the falsework alone. When high waves threatened the falsework foundation, construction was halted for a short time until winter storms abated. The crews excavated of earth and rock. Eight hundred and twenty-five trucks brought in 600,000 pounds of reinforcing steel. Sand and gravel were supplied from a plant in Big Sur. Construction required 45,000 sacks or of cement which was transported from Davenport, near Santa Cruz, and from San Andreas. Crews began placing concrete on November 27. The concrete was transported across the canyon on platforms using slings suspended from a cable above the creek. Bixby Creek Bridge from the northeast The bridge was completed on October 15, 1932, although the highway was not finished for another five years. At its completion, the bridge cost $199,861 and, at , was the longest concrete arch span on the California State Highway System. The bridge was necessary to complete the two-lane road which opened in 1937 after 18 years of construction. The completion of construction was celebrated with a ribbon-cutting ceremony led by Dr. John L.D. Roberts, who had conceived of the need for the road. = Rainbow Bridge = After the bridge was completed, it was at times known as the Rainbow Bridge, due to the presence of the Rainbow Lodge resort on the creek upstream from the bridge. It was operated by former Army Captain Howard Sharpe and his wife, Frida. After timber harvesting was no longer profitable, Sharpe bought the Bixby Creek Canyon ranch in 1919. He built a dirt road from the lodge up the canyon to Bixby Landing and another road down to the beach at the mouth of Bixby Creek. He sold part of his land to the state as part of the bridge right-of-way in 1930. When the bridge was completed and tourists no longer needed to descend to his lodge on the creek, he built a new lodge on the highway north of the bridge. = Seismic retrofitting = The bridge was retrofitted beginning in 1996 with an analysis by bridge engineering company Buckland & Taylor as part of the Caltrans Phase II seismic retrofit program. In their detailed evaluation of the bridge's seismic vulnerabilities, they were challenged to find a solution that met several difficult issues, including severe load factors, extremely limited physical access, maintaining the appearance of the existing historical structure, and a requirement by the State of California that at least one lane of the bridge remain open at all times. The crux of the design was the longitudinal post-tensioning of the entire bridge deck from end to end. The $20 million seismic retrofit began in May 1998. The cost of the retrofit was considerably increased by the requirement to preserve the historical look of the bridge. Prime contractor Vahani Construction of San Francisco was assisted by Faye Bernstein & Associates and Waldron Engineering. To reinforce the abutments supporting the bridge deck at either end, engineers put in place a floating slab, continuous with the deck, keyed into a massive pile cap with six 72-inch (1,800 mm) diameter cast-in-drilled-hole (CIDH) piles behind each abutment. To support the towers, engineers designed a full height structural wall that was integrated within each of the two existing towers. During the retrofit, they removed the top portion of the towers, including the roadway, and replaced them with a prestressed diaphragm that anchors the full height of the vertical tower. The diaphragm simultaneously distributes the vertical prestressing forces uniformly to the new concrete structural wall and the existing tower's concrete. The deck, which curves from one end to the other, was reinforced by adding heavily confined edge beams encasing high strength steel along the inside face of the exterior longitudinal girders underneath. These rods extended from one end of the roadway to the other. The reinforced edge beams ensure continuity across the many expansion joints and help distribute the bending strains due to lateral flexure. In addition to the reinforced edge beam, four large prestressing tendons were installed the length of the bridge along the underside of the deck slab. These tendons are stressed to pre-compress the concrete deck to approximately 800 psi and also serve as flexural reinforcement along with the high strength rods. Finally, engineers found a way to reinforce the bent columns attached to the arch, which possess complex and varying geometric challenges. They encased the bent columns with thin, lightweight, composite carbon fiber jackets that provide the necessary degree of confinement to ensure ductile response and also mimic the original design. In addition to the analyses performed by Buckland and Taylor, Caltrans commissioned Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to perform an independent study of the structure both with and without the proposed retrofit measures in place. The final report, which was published in June 1999, concludes that the retrofit appears to be appropriate even for earthquake ground motions including near-field displacement pulses, which were not considered in the original analyses. As a result of the retrofit, the continuous, stiffened deck has four lateral reaction points: two new massive abutments anchored by large-diameter, cast-in-drilled-hole piles. The two towers are strengthened and anchored to rock with tie-down anchors within the towers. The arch ribs are laterally supported at their crowns by new shear keys that link them to the reinforced deck. The expensive retrofit, completed in November 2000, still left the bridge officially classified as \\"functionally obsolete\\" because at in width, the bridge is less than the standard required of newly built bridges.  History  The land was historically occupied by the native Esselen people who visited the coast seasonally to harvest shellfish and to fish offshore. When the Spanish established the California mission system, only a very few were not baptized and conscripted, and they soon left the mountains to work on the nearby ranches. Governor Juan Alvarado granted the land from present day Carmel south to Palo Colorado Canyon, two miles north of Bixby Creek, to Marcelino Escobar in 1839 as part of the Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito. The land was later acquired by Alvarado's brother-in- law Jos√© Castro. Castro built a trail from Monterey to Palo Colorado Canyon as early as 1853, when he filed a map of his purchase. = Originally Mill Creek = Bixby Creek is named after pioneering Yankee businessman Charles Henry Bixby. Originally from Livingston County, New York, he arrived in California in 1852 and remained for five years. He returned east before coming back to California. After some success raising cattle in Sonoma County, he obtained a patent on April 10, 1889 for south of Bixby Creek, and later bought additional tracts of land on the north side of the creek, between it and Palo Colorado Canyon. He built a sawmill with a capacity of twelve thousand feet of lumber per day on the creek, which for many years was known as Mill Creek. He harvested timber and turned it into shakes, shingles, railroad ties, and trench posts. He also harvested the bark of the tanbark oak, which was used for tanning cow hides. he built a landing chute and hoist to transfer the lumber to ships anchored slightly offshore. Schooners were moored to deadeyes embedded in rocks of the adjacent shore. Cargo was hoisted in slings from the landing along a cable winched onto the waiting ship. Bixby discovered lime deposits on Long Ridge above Mill Creek. He had kilns built and used mules to haul the lime to the coast on wooden sleds. It was impossible to build a wharf from the cliffs that dropped into the ocean, and he instead built a hoist that could be used to ferry goods to and from ships anchored slightly offshore. The powdered lime was packed into barrels that were then attached to cable strung from the coastal cliff and about 50 yards out into the Pacific Ocean, where it was loaded aboard coastal schooners. He sold the fired lime for use in cement, mortar, and other building materials. ; Coast road extended south Bixby tried to persuade the county to build a road to Bixby Creek, but they refused, replying that \\"no one would want to live there.\\" In 1870, Bixby and his father hired men to improve the track and constructed the first wagon road including 23 bridges from the Carmel Mission to Bixby Creek. Sometime later Bixby partnered with William B. Post and extended what became known as the Old Coast Road south to his ranch. At Bixby Creek, the road was necessarily built inland to circumvent the deep canyon. It also went inland to circumvent the Little Sur River. It then led to the Post Ranch on the Rancho El Sur near present-day Andrew Molera State Park. The 30-mile (48 km) trip from Carmel could take three days by wagon or stagecoach. The single-lane road was closed in winter when it became impassable. Coast residents would occasionally receive supplies via a hazardous landing by boat from Monterey or San Francisco. ; Sold to lime company In 1906, after he exhausted the supply of commercial timber, Bixby sold the land to the Monterey Lime Company. Lime was in great demand to help re-build San Francisco following the 1906 earthquake. The company built lime kilns up Bixby Canyon from the coast and mined the high grade limestone located in the area. To feed the limekiln fires, they cut much of the old growth redwood in the canyon. They built a aerial tram to haul the barrels of limestone from Long Ridge to Bixby Landing. A small group of homes grew up around the original Bixby Homestead. The kilns operated for four years until 1911 when a log jam during winter rains caused a flood in the canyon. The tram was used for a while longer to off and on-load supplies for the community from schooners. ; Lumber harvesting proposed In 1986 a portion of the land formerly owned by Bixby was held by Humboldt County-based Philo Lumber Company. They obtained a state permit to log over a million board feet of redwood. The residents of Palo Colorado Canyon were intensely opposed to the plan, but it was only derailed by the savings and loan crisis. The property was seized by federal financial regulators and was later sold to the Big Sur Land Trust, which then sold it to the Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District in 1988. The district joined it with three adjacent properties to form the Mill Creek Redwood Preserve. ; Adler Ranch sale In the 20th century, Axel Adler built a cabin on the former Bixby Ranch and gradually acquired more land. In 2013, a portion of the Adler Ranch was put on the market for $15 million. It is located at the end and south of Palo Colorado Road. It is adjacent to Los Padres National Forest, Mill Creek Redwoods Preserve, and includes the peak of Bixby Mountain and the upper portions of Mescal Ridge. The El Sur Ranch and Pico Blanco Mountain are to the south. The property is especially valuable because it includes nine legal parcels, five of which can be built on. The Big Sur Land Trust stated it is not interested in acquiring the property. The nonprofit Western Rivers Conservancy, which buys land with the goal to protect habitat and provide public access, secured a purchase agreement. It was interested in selling the land to the US Forest Service, which would make it possible for hikers to travel from Bottcher's Gap to the sea. But some local residents are opposed to the forest service acquiring the land. They are concerned about a lack of federal funding to maintain a critical fire break on the land.Adler Ranch Big Sur On October 2, 2019, they announced they were working on obtaining a grant that would allow the Esselen tribe to acquire the land. = Early resorts = Bixby Landing in 1911‚Äîknown then as Hamilton's Landing on Mill Creek‚Äîwas used to transport supplies and products to and from ships off shore. A post office was built near the sawmill in the early 1880s and was then moved west to the mouth of the canyon. Thomas Fussell bought the land and then sold it to Horace Hogues. In 1919, Captain Howard G. and Frida Sharpe bought the Bixby Creek canyon property. Remnants of its prior use included an old ranch house, barn, corral, dance hall, stable, numerous out- buildings, and several cabins that they rented to visitors. Sharpe built a dirt road from the lodge up the canyon to Bixby Landing and another road down to the beach at the mouth of Bixby Creek. When the bridge was completed, the lodge on Bixby Creek was no longer on the route used by tourists. In 1931 Sharpe built a new stone Rainbow Lodge on the western shoulder of the highway immediately north of the bridge. The former lodge in the canyon bottom was abandoned. In 1938, Sharpe re-discovered a colony of California sea otters, thought to be extinct. More tourists came to see the sea otters and Sharpe added cabins and renamed it the Bixby Inn. A fire in 1941 burned what was left of the ranch on the canyon floor, and the Sharpes subdivided the property and sold parcels. The restaurant was closed at the beginning of World War II, when gas conservation regulations severely restricted non-essential travel. It was later sold to Gallatin Powers, who renamed it Gallatins, and later the Crocodile's Tail. Years later, the site was found to be geologically unsafe and in November 1953 the building was bulldozed over the cliff.[Monterey Peninsula Herald November 17, 1953] = Brazil Ranch = The Brazil Ranch on Serra Hill south of Bixby Creek on the Big Sur coast circa 1880s or 1890s The former Brazil Ranch (also known as the Bixby Ocean Branch) is located on Serra Hill immediately south of Bixby Creek and the Bixby Creek Bridge, making it one of the most photographed spots on the Big Sur coast. Job Heath obtained a land patent on May 20, 1884 and he and his wife Serena Waters homesteaded the ranch. Antonio Brazil married Mary Pfeiffer and they bought Heath's property. The hill is not named for Junipero Serra, but is a corruption of the Spanish word, cerro, meaning \\"high hill.\\" ; Acquired by Allen Funt The Brazil family operated the ranch for nearly a century. In 1977, Tony and Margaret Brazil sold the ranch to Allen Funt, creator of the television show Candid Camera. Funt raised quarter horses and cattle on it. He built a cabin and barn on the site and improved it for use as a ranch. After Funt had a stroke in 1993, he tried to interest environmental groups in buying the land without success. ; Subdivided by developer After Funt died in 1999, land speculator Brian Sweeney and two partners, acting as Woodside Partners, a Las Vegas-based company, began nine months of negotiations to buy the property. Sweeney's lawyer unearthed long-forgotten records showing that the property was originally composed of nine land patents. He and his partners persuaded county officials to keep mum and bought the land for $9.2 million. As permitted by law, he obtained county permission to subdivide the land into nine parcels, vastly increasing its value. He soon sold Funt's house and the parcel it stood on for $7.2 million. ; Purchased by trust Sweeney's actions stunned local community leaders and activists, who joined together to prevent him and his partners from subdividing and developing the land. Less than a year later, the Trust for Public Land bought the property for more than $26.25 million, almost tripling what the partners paid. On September 24, 2002, they and the U.S. Forest Service announced that the land had been added to the Los Padres National Forest. While criticized by some for the huge profit they took in selling the property to the trust, a local real estate agent said if Sweeney and his partners had sold the land to private parties, they could have earned as much as $50 million. ; Public access The public can enter the USFS land using an unmarked gate to a little-used dirt road on the east side of Highway 1, south of the Bixby Creek Bridge. There is no parking lot. Visitors can hike up a steep trail to the ridge overlooking the coast. = Trail and road access = To allow access to the Mill Creek Redwood Preserve, a trail was built by hand over ten years from Palo Colorado Road to an overlook. The trail was closed in 2016 due to destruction from the Soberanes fire. , the Palo Colorado Road is closed due to washouts caused by rains after the Soberanes Fire in 2017. To limit traffic on narrow Palo Colorado Road, access is limited to day use and only six permits per day are available. Visitors must obtain a permit in advance from the Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District to visit the preserve. The trail head is located inland on Palo Colorado Road. The Old Coast Road that the bridge replaced remains open to vehicles, weather permitting. The Old Coast Road from the north side of Bixby Creek is long, cutting inland across the Little Sur River, and ends near the northern border of Andrew Molera State Park, to the south along Highway 1. = Scenic designation = The bridge contributes to the scenic attraction of driving Highway 1. The section of the highway from Cambria to Carmel Highlands was the first in the state to be designated as a Scenic Highway in 1965. In 1966 First Lady Lady Bird Johnson led the official scenic road designation ceremony at Bixby Creek Bridge.  Overuse issues  The bridge was already popular before the introduction of smart phones and social media, and visitors to the Bixby Creek Bridge and other Big Sur attractions have dramatically increased since then. Due to the large number of visitors, congestion and slow traffic between Carmel and the bridge is frequently the norm during popular holiday and vacation periods. The bridge was rated as the No. 1 ‚ÄúInstagram-Worthy Destination for 2019 Travels‚Äù by the website Travelpulse.com.Big Sur plea: Tourists, honor our home The California state tourism commission describes the bridge as \\"a must-see road trip spot for many and probably the most Instagrammed features along Highway 1 coastline.\\" It promotes the bridge world-wide, including a deal with China's online tourism operator Tuniu that put the bridge on a custom route. During holiday weekends and most summer vacation periods, the bridge area is \\"like a Safeway parking lot\\" according to a local resident. Traffic can come to a standstill as motorists wait for a parking spot. There is a pull out to the north and west side of Highway 1, but when it is full, visitors sometimes fail to completely pull off the highway, leaving inadequate space for passing vehicles. The area near the bridge has become overwhelmed by visitors. Tourists routinely ignore warning signs to stay off the cliffs, and walk across the narrow wide bridge, although there is no room for pedestrians. There are no toilets within several miles of the bridge, and visitors resort to defecating in nearby bushes. Residents complain about toilet paper, human waste, and trash littering the roadside. On December 29, 2018, two dozen residents and business leaders turned out with signs alongside the northern approach to the bridge to launch a campaign they've named The Big Sur Pledge, encouraging visitors to treat the region with more respect.

The United States Postal Service introduced an $18.30 definitive stamp designed by Carl T. Herrman of North Las Vegas, Nevada. The stamp features a color digital illustration of Bixby Creek Bridge by Dan Cosgrove of Clarendon Hills, Illinois. = Film, television, and video games = The bridge was featured in the opening scene of the 1969-70 television series Then Came Bronson, in the films Play Misty for Me, Escape To Witch Mountain and The Sandpiper, and in numerous auto commercials. The bridge is also featured in the video game Grand Theft Auto V. Most recently, the bridge was featured in the opening credits of the 2017 television series Big Little Lies. = BASE jumping = Individuals have been known to BASE jump off the bridge. Monterey County Sheriff Steve Bernal told the media that while it is technically legal to jump off the bridge, jumpers land on private property, constituting trespassing. It is also easy to commit traffic violations while on the bridge. Steven Jester, who lived in Aptos at the time, jumped off the bridge in 2010 in defiance of a Highway Patrol officer who attempted to stop him. Someone assisting him recorded the confrontation with the officer and his jump. It got over two million views on YouTube. He was found guilt of threatening violence against a peace officer, driving under the influence of alcohol, possession of marijuana and disobeying peace officer order. He could have been sentenced to three years in jail, but the judge gave him probation and required him to enter an alcohol rehab program. On January 20, 2016, two BASE jumpers died when they landed near the surf and were overwhelmed by waves. Officials only determined that the two were missing on January 23 after their rental car was found abandoned near the bridge. Searchers found only the man's parachute, helmet, and video camera on the shore beneath the bridge. Video recovered from the helmet camera revealed how they died. Mary Catherine Connell landed safely on the small beach but was overwhelmed in succession by three waves. BASE jumping instructor Rami Kajala saw her overtaken by the waves and unsuccessfully attempted to rescue her. Kajala was known as one of the world's leaders in BASE jumping and instructed individuals around the world. Kajala's body was found more than two weeks later. Connell's body was never recovered.

Gungunhana was the last dynastic emperor of the Empire of Gaza, a territory now part of Mozambique. Nicknamed the Lion of Gaza, he reigned from around 1884 to 28 December 1895, the day he was imprisoned by Joaquim Mouzinho de Albuquerque in the fortified village of Chaimite. Because he was already known to the European press, the Portuguese colonial administration decided to exile him, rather than send him to face a firing squad, as would normally be the case. He was transported to Lisbon, accompanied by his son Godide and other dignitaries. After a brief stay at the Fort of Monsanto, he was transferred to the Azores, where he would die eleven years later. Biography Gungunhana, with the seven wives taken with him as prisoners to Lisbon (photo taken in March, 1896) Originally given the name, Mdungazwe (defined in Zulu as 'one who confuses the people'), a name he carried until he assumed the throne in 1884, whereupon he would be known as Ngungunhane, he was born around 1850. According to oral tradition, he was born in the territory of Gaza, somewhere between the rivers Zambezi and Incomati, but, very probably, on the banks of the Limpopo River, where the main settlements of the Nguni people then stood. He was the son of Mzila (or Muzila), who was king of Gaza from 1861 to 1884, and Yosio, whose name, after her death, was replaced by Umpibekezana. His father was the son and successor of Soshangane who, as head of an army advancing northward from Zululand, had founded the Gaza Empire. =Early years (1850‚Äì1864)= Mundagazi was born into a complex society during a period of great social and political instability. His grandfather, Soshangane (also called Manicusse or Manukosi), was the king (or Nkosi) of a Nguni-speaking people, related to the Swazi, whose ancestral lands were in the territory of present-day South Africa. Soshangane was also the undisputed leader of a powerful army that, following the onset of the Mfecane (The Great Scattering), migrated to the north from Zululand. On their way north, throughout the 1820s and into the 1830s, Soshangane was able to persuade the chiefs of about two hundred tribes to become his vassals. Their ultimate destination, planned or not, was land located between the Maputo and Zambezi rivers. In the process, the Nguni displaced, co-opted, or slaughtered the native peoples. Upon arrival, Soshangane founded an empire to which he gave the name, Gaza (the name of his grandfather). In its initial stages, Gaza had about of land. With the arrival of the Nguni, the relative quiet that had prevailed among the local peoples and the Portuguese traders, who had established themselves along the Mozambican coast, was rudely broken by a succession of massacres and forced submissions to a new power. This created a climate of insecurity and fear that remained for decades. Founding of the Gaza Empire After a walk of nearly twenty years' duration, Soshangane and his people established the center of their power in the valley of the River Limpopo founded the village of Chaimite, and declared it his capital. As the longest-standing European presence in those territories, Portugal decided to send, in August 1840, an embassy to the court of Manicusse. The delegation was led by Ensign Caetano Pinto dos Santos, who had instructions to establish a treaty of friendship, delivering a sword and a sash to the king in exchange for a short spear and a shield. The embassy was received, but Manicusse said that, at the moment, he saw no advantage in a treaty of friendship with the king of Portugal. (This is documented in a report, dated 18 November 1840, submitted by Ensign Caetano Pinto dos Santos and archived by the Registrar of the National Farms in Inhambane, Jo√£o Caetano Dias.) Even though the sword was exchanged for the short spear, the attacks continued. So it happened that, in this region, in this social and political context, around 1850, Mundagaz, the future Ngungunhane, a prince of royal blood, the son of Mzila, one of the putative heirs of Manicusse, was born. Educated for the life of a warrior, from an early age participating in the long hikes that his father and grandfather had undertaken annually throughout their vast fields, Ngungunhane was raised to fight and to learn the tactics of war that were his grandfather's legacy. A dynastic crisis When Manukuza died in 1858, the competition for the throne pitted Mzila, the father of Mundagazi, and Mawewe, his uncle, against one another. After a brief period of armed strife, Mawewe emerged victorious. He decided, in 1859, to press his advantage by attacking his brothers and their families. Mzila was able to escape to the Transvaal, where he organized an army to overthrow his brother. Mundagaz probably followed his father into exile, escaping the attempt by Mawewe to destroy their lineage. The Portuguese colonial administration became convinced that Mawewe was likely to be just as aggressive and fractious as his father and predecessor had been, and they, together with their Boer neighbors to the south, and many local tribal leaders, who also felt threatened by the prospect of Nguni domination, decided to unite against him. The president of the Orange Free State, and a number of Boer officials, on 29 April 1861, met with the vice-consul of Portugal, and proposed a formal alliance against Mawewe, a proposal that was accepted with reluctance. However, these reservations disappeared when Mawewe demanded that the Portuguese colony at Louren√ßo Marques (now called Maputo) pay tribute in the form of footwear, including a clause that required pregnant Portuguese women to pay a double tribute. This was backed by a threat that failure to comply would cause Mawewe to undertake a scorched-earth policy against Portuguese interests in the region. Onofre Louren√ßo de Paiva de Andrade, then governor of Louren√ßo Marques, responded by sending a rifle cartridge to Mawewe, saying that this would be the form his tribute would take. Civil war War was declared, and, on 2 November 1861, Mzila arrived in Louren√ßo Marques to accept Portuguese support in return for his allegiance. From this point forward, Mzila broadcast his claim to be the rightful king, and the war gained momentum. The decisive battle was waged in late November 1861, along a line of nearly twenty kilometres from the beaches of Matola to the land of Moamba. Despite having fewer men, Mzila won, and, on 30 November, he showed up at the prison in Louren√ßo Marques, where he was amicably received by the governor. On 1 December 1861, a treaty was signed, in which it stated that Mzila was a Portuguese subject. A record of this agreement, which was approved by the Portuguese government, was published in the orders of 18 February 1863 by Jos√© da Silva Mendes Leal, then Minister of the Navy and Overseas. A new and decisive victory in battle by Mzila on 16 December 1861 in the Maputo valley, consolidated the alliance. In all, Portugal had provided Mzila two thousand rifles, fifty thousand rounds of ammunition, and twelve hundred flints. In addition, the Portuguese had secured the support of the Boers and undertaken intermediation with local leaders, who preferred to submit to the suzerainty of the distant king of Portugal rather than the local hegemony of Mawewe. All of this accrued to Mzila's benefit. Although the war lasted until 1864, and the capital of the kingdom was moved from the valley of the Limpopo River to Mossurize, north of the river Save, in the current Mozambican province of Manica, Mzila was gradually mastering the art of controlling the Nguni and its vassals. From 1864 onward, he was the undisputed ruler of the Empire of Gaza. With these events, Mundagaz became a potential successor among the princes, and he began a journey that would lead to power. =The reign of Mzila (1864‚Äì1884)= After the war, Mzila devoted himself to the consolidation of his power and the expansion of the Empire of Gaza. He maintained the style of governance of his father, ruling with an iron hand and keeping the habit of walking long distances to keep tabs on all of his domains. The capital remained at Mossurize, and the village of Chaimite, the former capital, became a place of pilgrimage, of memorials devoted to past feats, and a dwelling-place for ancestral spirits. Despite the treaty signed in 1861 and the effective alliance with the Portuguese that had gained him his throne, the warriors of Mzila ran roughshod over the Portuguese colonies at Sofala and Inhambane several times, and a climate of tension developed that did not accord with the formal agreements and Mzila's frequent expressions of friendship and gratitude. Competition among the Europeans The Pink Map ‚Äì Portugal's claim of sovereignty over the land between Portuguese Angola and Portuguese Mozambique. Simultaneously, there was increasing competition in the region among the Europeans: the Portuguese, the English, and the Afrikaners were vying for control of more and more territory. Expeditions of discovery aimed at broadening the European exploitation of Africa were more and more frequent, and there were more and more missionaries and traders visiting the land of Gaza. Lisbon had already started to nourish ambitions of a swath of colonies across southern Africa, from Mozambique on the Indian Ocean to Angola on the Atlantic, all of them colored pink, the traditional color of Portuguese possessions on maps of Africa produced in Europe (see Pink Map). At the beginning of the 1880s, when the reign of Mzila was approaching its end, competition among the Europeans grew rapidly. Their expeditions into the interior increased in frequency, penetrating more deeply into the territory of Gaza. The pressure on Mzila to permit the exploitation of minerals also grew. Maintaining a policy of striking a strategic balance with Portuguese interests, Mzila, on 27 January 1882, accompanied by two columns of troops, visited Louren√ßo Marques, to pledge his allegiance and to offer his explanations of the attacks on Sofala and Inhambane. He was received, with all appropriate honors, by the governor, who offered him oxen, rice, and spirits. Soon after, in the middle of that year, Mzila asked for a Portuguese flag so that he could fly it over his camp. Formal relations with Mzila The following year, in 1883, Portugal decided to appoint an ambassador to the court of Mzila. The assignment fell to Ant√≥nio Maria Cardoso, a man experienced in the region, who was dispatched immediately to the place where Mzila was sojourning, in the neighborhood of Bulawayo, in what is now Zimbabwe. After a long wait to get permission to approach the camp and to be received, Ant√≥nio Maria Cardoso managed to secure an audience with Mzila and was well received. The same happened to the captain of artillery, Joaquim Carlos Paiva de Andrada, who went to Manica that year to speak to Mzila. However, despite the apparently satisfactory relationship with the natives, pressure was rising among the European powers to require that a colonizing power demonstrate its ability to effectively exploit and administer its domains in order to justify the possession of territories in Africa. At this time, given the increasing involvement of other European powers in Africa, Portugal decided to strengthen its presence on that continent by organizing major expeditions of exploration, especially those of Roberto Ivens and Hermenegildo Capelo, aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of an occupation of the interior of Africa. Of course, Mzila didn‚Äôt know that he had entered the last year of his life. Neither did he realize that, thousands of kilometers away, white European diplomats were gathering at the Berlin Conference, where they intended to devise a scheme for sharing Africa among the European powers. When he died in late August 1884, the Europeans were meeting to set rules that would determine the future of Gaza. The succession During the reign of Mzila, Mundagaz, his son, the future Ngungunhane, was gradually gaining importance, becoming one of the leading figures of his court. When his father died, Mundagaz was not the legitimate heir of Mzila, a position held by his half-brother, Mafemane, whose mother was the principal wife (nkosicaze). So, he instigated a few fratricidal skirmishes, a tradition of the Nguni, which resulted in Mundagaz removing the crown prince from contention and forcing his other two rivals, Anhana and Mafabaze, to flee into exile. At the end of 1884, in Mossurize, Mundagaz ascended the Nguni throne, assumed the name, Ngungunhane, the son of the lion, and became the Emperor of Gaza. Descendants The descendants of Gungunhana currently reside in South Africa. De jure king Eric Mpisane Nxumalo applied for recognition by the Nhlapo Commission, which was rejected in 2012.Court case over kingship Claims of the kingdom's authority over the Tsonga people have also been rejected by Tsonga traditional leaders on the grounds that the Tsonga people have been living outside of the Gaza Kingdom since it was founded in 1820 by Soshangane and have never been part of that Kingdom. History states that the Tsonga people fled before Soshangane and established themselves in the Transvaal, free from any despotic rule. In the Transvaal, the Tsonga people founded new colonies and had no relationship with the Gaza Kingdom at all. When the Tsonga people went to war with their new neighbours, the Venda and the Pedi, the Gaza kingdom did not provide any military support, the Tsonga people fought battles alone, the only military assistance that the Tsonga people received while fighting either the Pedi or the Venda was from their beloved 'White Chief', Joao Albasini, who acted at all times as a paramount chief of the Tsonga in the Transvaal. Joao Albasini supplied the Tsonga people with assault rifles and ammunition to protect themselves against the Pedi and the Venda during times of war with these tribes. Because the Tsonga people were fully armed with assault rifles, neither the Pedi nor the Venda were able to challenge the Tsonga during times of conflict because Joao Albasini, a Tsonga chief, has given assault rifles to more than 2000 Tsonga warriors, these 2000 Tsonga warriors were controlled by Joao Albasini and carried assault rifles day and night. Therefore, neither the Venda nor the Pedi could risk going into war with the Tsonga, for they feared the Tsonga superior weaponry. With Joao Albasini supplying the Tsonga people with ammunition, the Gaza Kingdom became irrelevant and was therefore not useful to the Tsonga at all, the Tsonga people therefore had nothing to do with the Gaza Kingdom at all. The Tsonga people want to continue to live their lives in scattered villages without a supreme King, as they have done for centuries. Currently the Tsonga people are led by chiefs, who are supreme rulers in their villages without a King. The Tsonga villages in South Africa starts from Valdezia in Louis Trichardt and end at Mkhuhlu in Hazyview, which is a distance of 315 km long. It is suggested by the Tsonga that Eric Nxumalo become a paramount chief of his people at Bushbuckridge and leave the Tsonga people alone, they have Chiefs and do not need a King.Nghunghunyani was never a Tsonga king References Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism Category:1850s births Category:1906 deaths Category:Mozambican royalty Category:Mozambican Roman Catholics Category:19th-century monarchs in Africa Category:Mozambican exiles Category:African kings Category:Gaza Empire Category:History of the Azores Category:Monarchies of South Africa ","title":"Gungunhana"},{"id":"2460293","text":"T√§rnaby is a locality situated in Storuman Municipality, V√§sterbotten County, Sweden with 482 inhabitants in 2010.

Collines is subdivided into six communes, each centered at one of the principal towns: Bant√®, Dassa- Zoum√©, Glazou√©, Ou√®ss√®, Savalou and Sav√©. Benin originally had six administrative regions (d√©partements), which have now been bifurcated to make 12. Each of the deconcentrated administrative services (directions d√©partementales) of the sectoral ministries takes care of two administrative regions. A law passed in 1999 transformed the sous-prefectures, the lowest level of territorial administration, into local governments. Municipalities and communal councils have elected representatives who manage the administration of the regions. The latest elections of the municipal and communal councils were held in June 2015.

She is known for her contemporary interpretations of Irish folk songs, strongly influenced by American country music. Background O'Connell was born in Ennis, the main town in County Clare, in the west of Ireland. Born into a musical family, O'Connell was the third of four sisters. Her mother's family owned Costello's fish shop in Ennis where O'Connell worked until music became her full-time career. She grew up listening to her mother's light opera, opera, and parlor song records. Her father's interest leaned towards the rebel ballads. Despite the presence of classical music in the house, O'Connell got very involved in the local folk club scene and together with Mike Hanrahan, who later fronted trad/rock outfit Stockton's Wing, they performed a country music set, as a duo called 'Tumbleweed'. O'Connell attended St Joseph's Secondary School in Spanish Point from 1971 to 1974, where she took part in the school choir. She was also part of the \\"C√∫l Aodha Choir\\", led by Peader √ì Riada, that sang at the funeral of Willie Clancy in 1973. Musical careerSolo career= O'Connell began her professional musical journey during a six-week tour of the US in 1980, as vocalist for the traditionally-based Celtic group De Dannan. The following year, she was featured on the band's landmark album, The Star Spangled Molly, (where she has the lead vocals on four tracks) which became something of a national phenomenon in her homeland. However, not long after joining the group she became very interested in the experimental roots music of America's New Grass Revival when the bands' paths crossed, and moved to the US in 1986, settling in Nashville, Tennessee. There she met newgrass pioneers Bela Fleck and Jerry Douglas, with whom she'd work on most of her records. She recorded her first solo album in 1983, however, it didn't make any impact in Ireland or in the United States. O'Connell received a Grammy nomination for her 1989 album, Helpless Heart (originally released in Ireland in 1987 as Western Highway), which was her first record released under Warner Bros. Records. Real Life Story (1990), and Blue is the Colour of Hope (1992), registered a move toward a pop synthesis. O'Connell's versions of \\"Living in These Troubled Times\\" and Cheryl Wheeler's \\"Summerfly\\" became standout tracks on the 1993 album A Woman's Heart, on four all-female overseas tours and on the 1994 follow-up album in her homeland. A Woman's Heart Vol. 2 features her heartfelt renditions of Nanci Griffith's \\"Trouble in the Fields\\" and Gerry O'Beirne's \\"Western Highway.\\" After numerous album heavily inspired by American newgrass music, O'Connell returned to her Irish roots with the 1997 release, Wandering Home. As the new millennium approached, O'Connell signed with the Sugar Hill label in late 2000 and began working on her seventh album. Instead of working with her longtime producer Jerry Douglas, O'Connell had Ray Kennedy (who worked with Steve Earle, Lucinda Williams) produce Walls and Windows, which was released in 2001, and featured an eclectic collection of songs, including work by Kim Richey, Van Morrison, John Prine, Eric Clapton and Patty Griffin. Her 2004 album, Don't I Know, contained musical textures added by everything from fiddles, to clavinets, to lap steel and B-3 organ. The 2009 album, Naked With Friends, is Maura‚Äôs first a cappella album. Guest vocalists include Mary Black, Paul Brady, Moya Brennan, Jerry Douglas, Alison Krauss, Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh, Tim O'Brien, Dolly Parton, Sarah Dugas, Kate Rusby and Darrell Scott. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award. In 2013 O'Connell announced the end of her solo career. http://www.kentucky.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/article44446356.html https://dailygazette.com/article/2013/03/14/0314_maura?print =Other work= In addition to her solo work, O'Connell has collaborated with a number of Celtic, folk, pop and country artists, including Van Morrison, Brian Kennedy, Moya Brennan, Mary Black, John Prine, Jerry Douglas, Tim O'Brien, John Gorka, Bela Fleck, Robert Earl Keen, Dolly Parton and Shawn Colvin. She has also sung background vocals for a number of artists, including Van Morrison's 1988 project with the Chieftains, Irish Heartbeat and Stockton's Wing on Take A Chance. Acting Aside from the music world, Martin Scorsese cast O'Connell, scruffed up for the role, as an Irish migrant street singer in his 19th- century epic Gangs of New York, released in 2002.

It was located at the top four floors of the then-newly refurbished London Pavilion building at Piccadilly Circus, London. Predominantly British artists featured, but many American artists were also included. The attraction told the story of rock and pop from the 1950s to the then-present day by using videos, music, narration and audio-animatronic figures.  Beginnings  The London Pavilion, former site of Rock Circus In the mid 1980s, the Tussauds Group began looking for a new attraction venture in London, having just been involved in the development of Chessington World of Adventures theme park in Surrey. Market research discovered that focus groups were attracted to the idea of a music-based tourist attraction, as opposed to other concepts suggested, such as an exhibition on the history of the city. Deciding which musical stars should be represented in the exhibitions was left to general manager Martin King, head of Tussauds Studios Ian Hanson, and national radio DJ and music writer Paul Gambaccini. The exhibition was opened in 1989 by Jason Donovan but closed permanently in September 2001. The attraction was built in the top four floors of the newly refurbished London Pavilion building at Piccadilly Circus, London. It featured wax figures similar to Madame Tussauds original venue, as well as an animatronic finale show. The audio-animatronic figures took up to a year to create and, depending on the complexity of movement involved, cost up to $170,000 each. The control systems for the last floor exhibition were provided by Electrosonic Ltd. Multi control system for the lower floors and Infrared headset system was provided by Sycomore SA (Fr) Exhibition Visitors walked around the exhibition wearing headphones which used infra-red technology to beam relevant audio material according to what you were looking at. The centrepiece of the exhibition was a 'live' show performed by a series of lifelike animatronic figures, looking at the history of Rock music from 1950 to the present day. The audience sat in an auditorium which rotated to view the various stages. Many of the performers featured in the exhibition donated their own clothes; Paul Simon, Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits, Eric Clapton and Phil Collins all donated items amongst others, with Simon sending a guitar and a pair of jeans for his wax figure and Knopfler a pair of his boots and a shirt to copy. Visitors would be given a set of wireless re-chargeable headphones (infrared transmission) and follow a path walking amongst the first floor's exhibits. Each exhibit had its own audio track playing on a loop to the headphones, once guests moved in-range of the infra-red signal. The audio featured narration by Paul Gambaccini, who discussed the performer the relevant exhibit was for, along with short clips of their music, with these descriptions typically lasting no more than a few minutes each. Guests could also occasionally have pictures taken with the wax figures. The main atrium featured a rotating set with the figures of Elton John performing \\"Bennie and the Jets,\\" Little Richard singing \\"Tutti Frutti\\" and Stevie Wonder with \\"I Just Called to Say I Love You\\", with the two former seated at pianos, whilst Wonder sat at a three-keyboard synthesizer, all pointing into the centre of the stage. At pre-determined intervals of a few minutes or so, a figure of Elvis Presley would rise up between the three pianos to sing \\"Glory Hallelujah\\", before dropping back down out of sight. The remaining floors followed the same pattern, with various music performers modelled in different backdrops or scenes, or posed in balconies and walkways and visitors moved between them via escalators and lifts as needed. These scenes included; * A large hanging video display, composed of 36 monitors linked together to create one big \\"screen\\". * References to the Live Aid music concert and Woodstock music festival. * A VIP area featuring Elvis Presley and Bono * A Memorabilia corridor * A 1960s London street scene, featuring Tina Turner. * The Beatles, in a recreation of their The Cavern Club set * Boy George, seated on top of a bin, just outside the main entrance. * \\"Wall of Hands\\", which was a wall- mounted collection of palm imprint casts of various rock musicians of the time, much like those at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles. * Buddy Holly, featuring rare audio of an interview held with DJ Alan Freed, in a radio studio scene. * Jerry Lee Lewis, playing a stand-up piano which featured an opening and closing lid, with a dry ice smoke effect whilst audio from \\"Great Balls of Fire\\" played. * Sting, in a recording \\"booth\\" set-up. * The Who, represented by a recreation of a large electro-mechanical pinball machine, complete with Roger Daltrey standing atop the playing field glass, and with Pete Townshend mounted on a metal supporting rod, appearing to jump out of the machine's back-glass, whilst sections of Elton John's version of \\"Pinball Wizard\\" from the movie version of Tommy were played. The escalator leading to the top and last floor was inside a perspex tunnel containing rings of neon lights and other lighting effects, and captioned with a sign \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", referencing the Led Zeppelin song of the same name. At the top of this escalator the floor opened out into a small area where visitors could watch music videos and similar content via ceiling mounted screens, while waiting for the finale show. This area also featured a Madame Tussauds attraction regular feature; that of a waxwork representing a member of the public or staff, and placed in-situ in the attraction; one pair of seats below a monitor just prior to the theatre show was occupied by a male waxwork looking up, as if watching the screen above him. This was similar to a feature at the main Madame Tussauds attraction located in Marylebone Road, which had a female waxwork standing at the Information counter, dressed in the same uniform as genuine members of staff, compete with the name tag \\"Maude\\" and which caught out many visitors to the attraction seeking assistance at the counter. Visitors would then walk to the theatre entrance and take any seat from the staggered seating. The show lasted approximately 15 minutes and comprised many animatronic figures. After the show, visitors exited the theatre and were guided to a spiral staircase taking them down to a lower level, and complete with music photographs and images mounted on the walls surrounding it. This took visitors to a small gift shop selling Rock Circus- branded merchandise, camera film, and other items. This was also where they could purchase any of their photographs taken earlier by the Rock Circus staff. From the gift shop another staircase led down and back to the headphone charging station, where visitors dropped off their headphones and exited back into the main London Pavilion building.  Artists featured  Amongst the artists featured as waxworks, in video, or as other exhibits were: * The Beatles * Jon Bon Jovi * Bono, of U2 * Boy George of Culture Club * Cher * Eric Clapton * Phil Collins * Sam Cooke * Lonnie Donegan * Jason Donovan * Gloria Estefan * Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music * Aretha Franklin * Bob Geldof * Billy Idol * Marc Bolan, of T-Rex * Buddy Holly * Iron Maiden * The Jacksons * Janet Jackson * Michael Jackson * Elton John * Bon Jovi * Mark Knopfler, of Dire Straits, playing guitar * Jerry Lee Lewis * Liberace * Little Richard, performing \\"Tutti Frutti\\" * Bob Marley (redeployed at the main Madame Tussauds attraction) * Madonna * Freddie Mercury, of Queen * George Michael * Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin * Elvis Presley * Cliff Richard * Johnny Rotten, from the Sex Pistols * Status Quo's Francis Rossi, and Rick Parfitt, up in a small balcony alcove playing guitars * Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel, performing \\"Mrs Robinson\\" * Rod Stewart, declared as \\"The Benny Hill of Pop\\" by Gambaccini's narration * Sting * Tina Turner * The Who, represented by Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend. * Stevie Wonder * Mick Hucknall of Simply Red * Jarvis Cocker of Pulp (band) To celebrate the opening of the new museum and to decorate the outside of the building, a series of rock legend statues were installed around the London Pavilion exterior. Artists featured were Annie Lennox, Buddy Holly, David Bowie, Diana Ross, Elton John, Gary Glitter, Jimi Hendrix, Madonna, Michael Jackson and Mick Jagger. End Theatre Finale \\"Live\\" Show The revolving theatre \\"live\\" show formed the last part of the attraction, and featured a number of animatronic performers, using the then-ground breaking pneumatic or otherwise known as air-compression technology, being seen for the first time in the UK at that time. More than 200 computer-generated signals were used to lift the figure of Bruce Springsteen's guitar-strumming right arm to the familiar raised fist when performing \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" Visitors entered the theatre and took up places on two rows of height-staggered seating, facing a stage area, and positioned on a turn-table (although this last point was not made obvious as not to spoil any surprise when the seats rotated. Once the seating was filled or at a pre-determined point the doors would be closed, and the show was started. Various animatronic performers would play out parts, with narration and linking dialogue provided by an animatronic Tim Rice, seen seated in a swivel chair, or via voice representation only at other points during the performance. Approximately halfway through the performance, the whole seating area was rotated to face a second stage area which accommodated further animatronic performers and features. The music that played whilst the stage rotated was the opening piano bars of Elton John's Bennie and the Jets song. Once the show had completed after around 10 minutes, the lights were raised again, and visitors exited the theatre. The performance begun with The Beatles, in full Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band costumes, performing an extract of the title track of the album, and went on include video, audio and animatronic representations of music stars and celebrities including: * Janis Joplin, with the animatronic starting at a seated position on a park bench, discussing those musicians that died during the Summer of Love, before going to a standing position and singing Me and Bobby McGee while holding a Southern Comfort bottle. Additionally, a bee or similar insect was seen flying around a rubbish bin placed beside the park bench, suspended on a wire) * Madonna, performing an extract of her Like A Virgin song, and presented lying on a bed surrounded by silk curtains. These were automatically drawn back to reveal the artist at the start of her section. A green-eyed animatronic leopard was also placed at the foot of the bed, and made a roaring sound, along with its eyes lighting up as the extract finished, the lights dimmed, and the curtains closed. This particular animatronic was unique within the performance in that it was the only one that played an instrument, rather than simply moving its hands, face, eyes, and lips in-time to the music; the animatronic held a tambourine in its left hand and at two points in its performance during the chorus of the song, it would shake the tambourine. * Bruce Springsteen, performing \\"Born in the USA\\" on a recreation of a stadium stage; cut-out raised arms appeared at the front of the stage and moved from left to right and back again, along with Dry-ice \\"smoke\\" being produced, to help give the effect. * Elvis Presley, singing \\"Love Me Tender\\". * Bob Dylan performing \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" with guitar and harmonica. * David Bowie, as the character Major Tom, dressed in a spacesuit, and performing \\"Space Oddity\\". This mimicked the section of the music video for the song, where a fully outfitted Major Tom can be seen spinning around in space, with a panicked Ground Control attempting to contact him. The lighting was set so that only the head of the animatronic was well-lit by a spotlight, with the body only lit by background illumination. This was intended to help hide the mechanics and rod that the figure was mounted on and which provided the spaceman's rotation effect. As the song reached the lines \\"Nothing I can do..

As the auditorium rotated, the animatronic characters were revealed either from behind a curtain, or they were raised into view. The control systems for the animatronics were underneath the stage area of the theatre, out of sight of the audience. The performance ended in the same manner as it started, with The Beatles, again in full \\"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" costumes, performing an extract of the title track of the album. The original set-up had audio fed to the audience via the infra-red headsets they wore in the rest of the attraction, but in later years, a sound system was installed to improve the quality of the sound.  Reception  Initial reception and attendance was good, and year two estimates put expected attendance at upwards of 750,000, in comparison to the group's main Madame Tussaud's attraction, which was then the most popular tourist attraction in Great Britain, drawing 2.7 million visitors a year. Some music fans may have questioned the choices of figures and for example, it was thought that Americans may have been baffled by the inclusion of Lonnie Donegan, when many other notable artists, such as Jim Morrison, were not represented. Tussards attempted to address this issue by polling visitors on who should be added to the exhibition, stating that the artists with the most votes would be made into figures and shown in a designated area. Some visitors were not at all impressed with the exhibition and at least one thought everything at the museum was unintentionally funny and not very convincing.  Major refurbishment 1998‚Äì1999  The ageing technology was given a ¬£4 million refurbishment in its ninth year and after a short closure period, it reopened in March 1999. New parts of the attraction included a virtual reality simulation of the view from a Wembley Stadium stage, and an after-show party set-up featuring Robbie Williams, The Spice Girls and Jarvis Cocker. One aspect that was not updated in this refurbishment was a dot-matrix display mounted just below the waxworks present on the outside of the London Pavilion, and which used standard incandescent light bulbs. Originally, when the attraction opened, this read \\"Rock Circus\\" which was scrolled to give an impression of movement. Over time, more and more of the bulbs failed and were never replaced, leading to the sign becoming entirely illegible, although a number of bulbs still continued to cycle on and off. This was seen by many as an indication of the tackiness of what was little more than an expensive tourist trap.Watson,James (2015). Own recollections  Closure in September 2001  Despite the update a few years previously, and having attracted up 682,000 visitors during its heyday in 1993, the attraction failed to meet its income targets, and closed permanently in September 2001. The space it formerly used was then replaced by Ripley's Believe It Or Not! museum (which opened 20 August 2008, and itself closed permanently on 25 September 2017). Tussauds Group staff blamed the closure on the strength of the pound (making London an expensive destination for the young Europeans the attraction was largely aimed at), and a steady decline in visitor numbers, despite a reported 6 million total visitors since opening in 1989. Many of the waxwork figures were redeployed at the main Madame Tussauds exhibition, and Rock Circus staff were offered posts at other Tussauds Group attractions to minimize redundancies.http://www.allbusiness.com/services/amusement-recreation- services/4564512-1.html[deadlink] Although unconfirmed, all or a number of the other wax figures used at the attraction were placed into storage by Tussauds.

Since the end of National Reorganization Process and the Dirty War, when guerrilla groups (mainly left-wing Peronist Montoneros and the Trotskyist Ej√©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo or ERP) were persecuted by the armed forces (together with law enforcement agencies and paramilitary groups), this term has been in wide use by people mainly in human rights movements, the political left, and former guerrilla members and supporters. These people argue that a national state, even one controlled by a de facto government, cannot be compared to a guerrilla or other subversive group, the difference being precisely that the institutions of a national state are supposed to act within the confines of law, even when using violence to fight outlaws. The term \\"theory of the two demons\\" is used pejoratively in left-wing discourse, and is attached to public personalities who plead to support \\"national reconciliation\\", sometimes appealing to the Christian idea of \\"forgive and forget\\", while (allegedly) having ulterior intentions. Since the image of the military has been tarnished by human rights abuses, economic chaos and the Falklands War defeat, accusers claim that advocates of right-wing repression must resort to reconciliation rhetoric, because a plain admission of support would disqualify them in the eyes of most Argentines. Since very few people actually endorse this \\"theory\\", it can be said that, its usage in the political debate notwithstanding, it is actually a type of straw man argument. Background Starting with the kidnapping and assassination of former de facto President Pedro Aramburu by the Montoneros in 1970, armed violence by left-wing groups increased. Some argued for the legitimacy of armed struggle on one or more of the following arguments: * Argentina was under a military dictatorship. * The government outlawed political parties and persecuted all forms of dissent, sometimes through violent means. * Juan Per√≥n, the leader of a vast mass of Argentines, was in exile and forbidden from re-entering the political arena. The Cuban revolution lent a romantic aura to armed struggle, and many young people found themselves sympathizing with the guerrillas or with left-wing Peronist organizations such as Juventud Peronista (JP), which had a radicalized wing named Tendencia Revolucionaria (\\"Revolutionary Tendency\\", sometimes shortened to La Tendencia) which was subject to Montoneros' influence. It can be argued that none of these groups attempted to terrorize the general populace through random violence. Yet, Montoneros killed notable persons who were not guilty of violence against the people (such as Arturo Mor Roig, the architect of the 1973 democratic transition, labor union leader Jos√© Ignacio Rucci. General consensus is that Montoneros carried out assassinations, and their supporters boasted of these, but the organization did not formally claim responsibility for them.) Some operations resulted in the deaths of conscript soldiers or lower-ranking policemen, who could not be held responsible for the alleged crimes of their superiors. Some attacks resulted in the deaths of the families or friends of military officers. Justification for the criticism Many have condemned the violence of the guerrilla radical groups (the ends, the means, or both), but feel that the atrocities committed by the armed forces and their associates during the Dirty War that started on 1976 have a different moral status, since the Argentine state under the armed forces dictatorship sought to terrorize the citizenry by means of kidnapping and forced disappearance of persons without trial or recourse of habeas corpus. The main criticism of the state's measures, as mentioned above, is that a national state is expected to enforce the law and respect human rights, even when repressing violent criminals that do not show such respect. Moreover, Argentine state terrorism included the illegal arrest and disappearance of high-school students asking for a rebate in public transportation, nuns who assisted the poor, and persons who happened to be on a guerrilla's telephone list. After the restoration of democracy The Argentine military and other people have expressed different opinions on the Dirty War. A few among the military involved have conceded that their actions were morally wrong and unjustifiable. A number of them have fully acknowledged their commitment and expressed no regrets. A third group refers to the crimes of the military as \\"excesses\\", implying that the country was in fact undergoing a war, with two sides fighting for different goals, so that certain objectionable outcomes were inevitably bound to occur, \\"as in all wars\\". Democratic forces were united in their criticism of the military in the run-up to the restoration of democracy in 1983. Less than three months after the inauguration of President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n, several critiques of Montoneros arose from within the democratic spectrum. Firstly, Montoneros, la soberbia armada (), a book written by the leftist journalist Pablo Giussani, that compared Montoneros to European extreme-left terror organizations. Then, a comprehensive and documented effort by British historian Richard Gillespie titled Montoneros, Soldados de Per√≥n was widely read and contributed to cement a non-romantic image of Montoneros. Juan Jos√© Sebreli invested a whole chapter of his Los deseos imaginarios del peronismo () to Montoneros, calling it \\"left-wing fascism\\". A few years later, Silvia Sigal and Eliseo Ver√≥n deconstructed the (verbal) opposition between Per√≥n and Montoneros in the third section of Per√≥n o muerte. Los fundamentos discursivos del fen√≥meno peronista. Alfons√≠n put the military juntas on trial, and prosecuted Montoneros leaders as well, as well as people accused of \\"illicit organization\\" with the Montoneros, such as Ricardo Obreg√≥n Cano, former Peronist governor of Cordoba deposed in a police coup in February 1974, and sentenced to ten years' prison in 1985. Under the Alfons√≠n administration, a state committee inquired into the disappearances. When its report was delivered to the government, the Interior Minister, Antonio Tr√≥ccoli, gave a speech equating Dirty War criminals and terrorists that was criticized by the leftist and Peronist opposition as an exponent of the \\"doctrine of the two demons\\". In 1988‚Äì1989, President Carlos Menem pardoned both the military commanders and the guerilla leaders. After taking office in 2003, the N√©stor Kirchner administration shifted the focus towards the uncovering and punishment of crimes of the Dirty War, including those formerly covered by the now-repealed amnesty laws passed in the mid-1980s. In August 2005, a judge struck Menem's pardons as unconstitutional, and a final pronouncement of the Supreme Court on the matter is expected soon. =The CONADEP report= In 1984, the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP) published a report titled Nunca M√°s (Never Again) with extensive research about instances of forced disappearance during the dictatorship. It started with a prologue which read: \\"During the 1970s, Argentina was shaken by a terror that came both from the extreme right and from the extreme left.\\" For a new edition of the CONADEP report presented at the Buenos Aires Book Fair of 2006, the Human Rights Secretariat added a paragraph stating the following: > \\"It is necessary to leave it clearly established [...] that it is > unacceptable to attempt to justify State terrorism as a sort of game of > counteracting violences, as if it were possible to look for a justifying > symmetry in the action of individuals faced with the Nation and the State's > estrangement from their proper goals.\\" Journalist Magdalena Ruiz Gui√±az√∫, a former member of CONADEP, criticized the new prologue: \\"It is a grave historical mistake to think that the report was an apology of the theory of the two demons.\\" Former President Alfons√≠n endorsed Ruiz Gui√±az√∫'s opinion and claimed that the addition of the prologue \\"shows a dangerous tendency to re-invent history\\".Dura r√©plica de Alfons√≠n, \\"La Naci√≥n\\" newspaper, 22 May 2006 Human Rights Secretary Eduardo Luis Duhalde justified the change saying that \\"the original prologue did not match the political philosophy that the State supports today with regards to the prosecution of crimes against humanity\\".Controversia por el pr√≥logo agregado al informe \\"Nunca m√°s\\", \\"La Naci√≥n\\" newspaper, 19 May 2006 Hebe de Bonafini, president of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, expressed satisfaction over the new text and harshly attacked the original: \\"S√°bato and Tr√≥ccoli wrote that shit to talk about two demons.

The object is usually created by pouring a liquid into the mold and allowing it to solidify: typical liquids include molten metal or plastic, plaster of Paris, epoxy resin. Molds generally divide into two classes: solid or flexible. Types There are five different types of flexible mold compounds in significant use today. =Hot-Melt= An example of hot-melt material is polyvinyl chloride. These are inexpensive, and worn molds can be melted and recast. It can be hazardous to handle due to high temperatures required for melting. The use of these materials are limited to model and pattern materials that are heat resistant. =Latex= Latex produces a very elastic, thin- walled, strong mold but the shrinkage is high. Latex molds must be supported to prevent distortion. 10 to 20 brush coats must be applied for adequate thickness, with time allowed to \\"dry\\" in between each coat, so making the mold is slow and time consuming. =Silicone rubbers= Silicone molds are excellent molds for casting resins and foams but the material cost is extremely high. =Polysulfide rubbers= Polysulfide rubbers are versatile and are especially useful for casting plaster, Hydrocal, and other water mixed cements. It can be used for casting wax candles and some limited use for resin casting. It is easy to handle, non-adhesive and can be poured over clay or practically any type of model or pattern, using very simple release agents such as soap or Vaseline. it can be used to take impressions directly from a waterclay or plastelene model, so that permanent master models can then be cast in plaster or Hydrocal. =Polyurethane flexible mold compounds= Polyurethane compounds have limited shelf stability, are \\"moisture conscious\\" and can be used for pouring practically any type of cementitious material, casting resin or foam formulation. It is easy to handle with simple mixing ratios and good fluidity. Cost of material is far below that of the silicones and appreciably lower than polysulfides. From the standpoint of general utility and economy, the polyurethanes surpass all other types.

This addresses the social, moral and economic values that tie a society together: values that vary in different cultures and change over time. Law regulates behaviour either to reinforce existing social expectations or to encourage constructive change, and laws are most likely to be effective when they are consistent with the most generally accepted societal norms and reflect the collective morality of the society. In performing this function, Cappalli has suggested that the critical values of any legal system include impartiality, neutrality, certainty, equality, openness, flexibility, and growth. This assumes that a state's courts function as dispute resolution systems, which avoid the violence that often otherwise accompanies private resolution of disputes. That is, citizens have to be encouraged to use the court system to resolve their disputes. The more certain and predictable the outcome of a court action, the less incentive there is to go to court where a loss is probable. But certainty must be subject to the needs of individual justice, hence the development of equity. A judge should always consider the underlying policies to determine whether a rule should be applied to a specific factual dispute. If laws are applied too strictly and mechanically, the law cannot keep pace with social innovation. Similarly, if there is an entirely new situation, a return to the policies forming the basic assumptions underpinning potentially relevant rules of law identifies the best guidelines for resolving the immediate dispute. Over time, these policies evolve, becoming more clearly defined and more deeply embedded in the legal system.  Fundamental principles  Ignorance of the law is not an excuse = The fundamental policy in the operation of a legal system is that ignorantia juris non excusat (ignorance of the law is no excuse). It would completely undermine the enforcement of any law if the person potentially at fault was able to raise as a successful defence that he or she had not been aware of the particular law. For this reason, all the main legislatures publish their laws freely whether in hard copy or on the Internet, while others offer them for sale to the public at affordable prices. Because everyone is entitled to access the laws as they affect their personal lives, all adults are assumed responsible enough to research the law before they act. If they fail to do so, they can hardly complain if their acts prove unlawful, no matter how transient they may be within the jurisdiction. The only exception to this rule excuses those of reduced capacity, whether as infants or through mental illness (for example, see the principle of doli incapax which raises an irrebuttable presumption in criminal law that an infant is incapable of committing a crime). = Sanctity of life = Underpinning most social, moral and religious systems is the policy of sanctity of life (also culture of life). In English criminal law, for example, duress is not allowed as a defence to murder because no threat is supposed to overcome a person's moral aversion to taking the life of another. Lord Jauncy in R v Gotts [1992]https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/r-v-gotts.php 2 AC 412 stated: In refusal of treatment and euthanasia, commission and omission by doctors and hospital authorities resulting in the death of patients has become of increasing significance as societies debate whether the duty to preserve life outweighs the right of the autonomous patient to choose death. More contentious are those situations in which the patient is unable to make the choice personally, e.g. because in a persistent vegetative state or en ventre sa mere, i.e. a child in the womb. = Doctrine of evasion = Similarly, in many branches of law, the doctrine of evasion prevents persons, both natural and artificial, from evading the application of obligations and liabilities already attaching to them. This represents a practical application of the policy that, as an outcome of the social contract, all persons owing allegiance to a state should be entitled to assume that everyone will receive fair and equal treatment before the law, i.e. there will be no favouritism or preferential treatment to any person by virtue of their rank or status within society. As such, this is an exception to the policy in the law of contract which usually allows the parties autonomy to enter into whatever agreement they want and which might otherwise be taken to permit the parties to exclude the normal operation of the law as between themselves (see the policy of freedom of contract). = Children = There are policies specific to all the main branches of law. Hence, one of the policies in family law is parens patriae, i.e. that the state is the default parent for all those children within its jurisdiction and that, if it is necessary to protect the interests of the child, the state will usurp the rights of the natural parents and assert its own rights as every child's legal guardian. Within the EU, the right of the child to be heard in any proceedings is a fundamental right provided in Article 24 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The views of the child shall be considered on matters which concern him or her in accordance with age and maturity. It also provides that the child's best interest shall be the primary consideration in all actions relating to children, whether taken by public authorities or private institutions. = Marriage = A policy which overlaps between family law and contract law is favor matrimonii which requires that any marriage entered into with a genuine commitment should be held valid unless there is some good reason to the contrary, matching contract law, where the preference is always to give effect to the genuine expectation of the parties.  Discussion  The policies adopted by states have come into being for several reasons. Some are aspects of the concept of sovereignty and reflect the essence of territoriality. Thus, public laws which either define the constitution of the state or regulate its powers can only apply within the boundaries agreed as a part of the process of de jure recognition of statehood by the international community. Other policies are aspects of the social contract, and they define and regulate the relationship between a state and those citizens who owe it allegiance. To that extent, these policies interact with (and sometimes overlap) civil rights and human rights. A number of these rights are defined at a supranational level and it will necessary for states to consider the extent to which international principles of law are to be allowed to influence the operation of law within their territories. Independently of the work of the international community to produce harmonised principles, the courts in one state may sometimes be faced with lawsuits which either seek to evade the operation of foreign laws through forum shopping or seek the enforcement of \\"foreign\\" laws. This is becoming increasingly common as people now move with reasonable freedom between states and international trade routinely services markets in different states. Such lawsuits will not be troublesome if the \\"foreign\\" law is the same as the forum law. But serious difficulties will arise if the application of the \\"foreign\\" law would produce a different result. These issues are resolved under the systems of law known as \\"conflict of laws\\". In conflict cases, no court will apply a \\"foreign\\" law if the result of its application would be contrary to public policy. This is problematic because excluding the application of foreign laws would defeat the purpose of conflict of laws by giving automatic preference to the forum court's domestic law. Thus, for the most part, courts are slower to invoke public policy in cases involving a foreign element than when a domestic legal issue is involved. That said, in those countries that have adopted treaty obligations involving human rights (e.g. the states who submit to jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights) broader concepts of public policy may now apply. Thus, courts may have to consider the \\"justice\\" implicit in a law that allows a husband to divorce his wife, but not vice versa, as an aspect of sexual discrimination. Similarly, it would be possible to question the propriety of polygamous marriages, the talaq system of divorce which is available in some Islamic states, and Jewish divorce known as the get, but it is likely that the courts would be cautious to avoid any implication that they were discriminating against religions. Equally difficult are the family laws which regulate incestuous relationships and capacity. For example, it is probable that one state should not be too quick to condemn another because it allows a marriage between an uncle and a niece, or allows a marriage with a girl of 13 (e.g. as in Northern Nigeria), particularly if the parties are not proposing residence in the forum state. Less controversial is the exclusion of foreign laws that are penal or territorial because they seek to collect taxes due to another state, e.g. in English law, if foreign exchange control legislation is used as \\"an instrument of oppression\\", it may be denied extraterritorial enforcement (Re Helbert Wagg & Co Ltd [1956] Ch 323, 351). Similarly, otherwise valid contracts may be denied enforcement if to do so would assist an enemy of the forum state or would damage the political relationship with a friendly state. When considering questions of status, English courts have held that incapacities imposed on account of slavery (Somersett's Case [1771] 20 St Tr 1), religion (Re Metcalfe's Trusts [1864] 2 De G J & S 122), alien nationality (Re Helbert Wagg & Co Ltd [1956] Ch 323 at pp. 345/46), race (Oppenheimer v Cattermole [1976] A C 249 at pp. 265, 276/78, 282/83), divorce (Scott v Attorney-General [1886] 11 PD 128), physical incompetence (Re Langley's Settlement Trusts [1962] Ch 541 at pp. 556/57) and prodigality (Worms v De Valdor [1880] 49L J Ch. 261 and Re Selot's Trusts [1902] 1 Ch. 488) will be disregarded. Policy is also a key component to the process for the enforcement of foreign judgments.  References  * Cappalli, Richard B. The Disappearance of Legal Method, (1997) 70 Temp. L.

Often it is understood to include only downside risk, meaning the potential for financial loss and uncertainty about its extent. A science has evolved around managing market and financial risk under the general title of modern portfolio theory initiated by Dr. Harry Markowitz in 1952 with his article, \\"Portfolio Selection\\". In modern portfolio theory, the variance (or standard deviation) of a portfolio is used as the definition of risk. Types Market risk = The four standard market risk factors are equity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, and commodity risk: Equity risk is the risk that stock prices in general (not related to a particular company or industry) or the implied volatility will change. When it comes to long-term investing, equities provide a return that will hopefully exceed the risk free rate of return The difference between return and the risk free rate is known as the equity risk premium. When investing in equity, it is said that higher risk provides higher returns. Hypothetically, an investor will be compensated for bearing more risk and thus will have more incentive to invest in riskier stock. A significant portion of high risk/ high return investments come from emerging markets that are perceived as volatile. Interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates or the implied volatility will change. The change in market rates and their impact on the probability of a bank, lead to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk can affect the financial position of a bank and may create unfavorable financial results. The potential for the interest rate to change at any given time can have either positive or negative effects for the bank and the consumer. If a bank gives out a 30-year mortgage at a rate of 4% and the interest rate rises to 6%, the bank loses and the consumer wins. This is an opportunity cost for the bank and a reason why the bank could be affected financially. Currency risk is the risk that foreign exchange rates or the implied volatility will change, which affects, for example, the value of an asset held in that currency. Currency fluctuations in the marketplace can have a drastic impact on an international firm's value because of the price effect on domestic and foreign goods, as well as the value of foreign currency denominate assets and liabilities. When a currency appreciates or depreciates, a firm can be at risk depending on where they are operating and what currency denominations they are holding. The fluctuation in currency markets can have effects on both the imports and exports of an international firm. For example, if the euro depreciates against the dollar, the U.S. exporters take a loss while the U.S. importers gain. This is because it takes less dollars to buy a euro and vice versa, meaning the U.S. wants to buy goods and the EU is willing to sell them; it's to expensive for the EU to import from U.S. at this time. Commodity risk is the risk that commodity prices (e.g. corn, copper, crude oil) or implied volatility will change. There is too much variation between the amount of risks producers and consumers of commodities face in order to have a helpful framework or guide. =Model risk= Financial risk measurement, pricing of financial instruments, and portfolio selection are all based on statistical models. If the model is wrong, risk numbers, prices, or optimal portfolios are wrong. Model risk quantifies the consequences of using the wrong models in risk measurement, pricing, or portfolio selection. The main element of a statistical model in finance is a risk factor distribution. Recent papers treat the factor distribution as unknown random variable and measuring risk of model misspecification. Jokhadze and Schmidt (2018) propose practical model risk measurement framework. They introduce superposed risk measures that incorporate model risk and enables consistent market and model risk management. Further, they provide axioms of model risk measures and define several practical examples of superposed model risk measures in the context of financial risk management and contingent claim pricing. = Credit risk = Credit risk management is a profession that focuses on reducing and preventing losses by understanding and measuring the probability of those losses. Credit risk management is used by banks, credit lenders, and other financial institutions to mitigate losses primarily associates with nonpayment of loans. A credit risk occurs when there is potential that a borrower may default or miss on an obligation as stated in a contract between the financial institution and the borrower. Attaining good customer data is an essential factor for managing credit risk. Gathering the right information and building the right relationships with the selected customer base is crucial for business risk strategy. In order to identify potential issues and risks that may arise in the future, analyzing financial and nonfinancial information pertaining to the customer is critical. Risks such as that in business, industry of investment, and management risks are to be evaluated. Credit risk management evaluates the company's financial statements and analyzes the company's decision making when it comes to financial choices. Furthermore, credit risks management analyzes where and how the loan will be utilized and when the expected repayment of the loan is as well as the reason behind the company's need to borrow the loan. Expected Loss (EL) is a concept used for Credit Risk Management to measure the average potential rate of losses that a company accounts for over a specific period of time. The expected credit loss is formulated using the formula: Expected Loss = Expected Exposure X Expected Default X Expected Severity Expected Exposure refers to exposure expected during the credit event. Some factors impacting expected exposure include expected future events and the type of credit transaction. Expected Default is a risk calculated for the number of times a default will likely occur from the borrower. Expected Severity refers to the total cost incurred in the event a default occurs. This total loss includes loan principle and interests. Unlike Expected Loss, organizations have to hold capital for Unexpected Losses. Unexpected Losses represent losses where an organization will need to predict an average rate of loss. It is considered the most critical type of losses as it represents the instability and unpredictability of true losses that may be encountered at a given timeframe. = Liquidity risk = This is the risk that a given security or asset cannot be traded quickly enough in the market to prevent a loss (or make the required profit). There are two types of liquidity risk: *Asset liquidity ‚Äì An asset cannot be sold due to lack of liquidity in the market ‚Äì essentially a sub-set of market risk. This can be accounted for by: **Widening bid-offer spread **Making explicit liquidity reserves **Lengthening holding period for VaR calculations *Funding liquidity ‚Äì Risk that liabilities: **Cannot be met when they fall due **Can only be met at an uneconomic price **Can be name-specific or systemic =Operational risk= Operational risk means the risk that a company or individual has to face due their own operation and decisions made for the investment =Other risks= Non-financial risks summarize all other possible risks *Reputational risk *Legal risk *IT risk Diversification Financial risk, market risk, and even inflation risk can at least partially be moderated by forms of diversification. The returns from different assets are highly unlikely to be perfectly correlated and the correlation may sometimes be negative. For instance, an increase in the price of oil will often favour a company that produces it, but negatively impact the business of a firm such an airline whose variable costs are heavily based upon fuel. However, share prices are driven by many factors, such as the general health of the economy which will increase the correlation and reduce the benefit of diversification. If one constructs a portfolio by including a wide variety of equities, it will tend to exhibit the same risk and return characteristics as the market as a whole, which many investors see as an attractive prospect, so that index funds have been developed that invest in equities in proportion to the weighting they have in some well-known index such as the FTSE. However, history shows that even over substantial periods of time there is a wide range of returns that an index fund may experience; so an index fund by itself is not \\"fully diversified\\". Greater diversification can be obtained by diversifying across asset classes; for instance a portfolio of many bonds and many equities can be constructed in order to further narrow the dispersion of possible portfolio outcomes. A key issue in diversification is the correlation between assets, the benefits increasing with lower correlation. However this is not an observable quantity, since the future return on any asset can never be known with complete certainty. This was a serious issue in the late-2000s recession when assets that had previously had small or even negative correlations suddenly starting moving in the same direction causing severe financial stress to market participants who had believed that their diversification would protect them against any plausible market conditions, including funds that had been explicitly set up to avoid being affected in this way. Diversification has costs. Correlations must be identified and understood, and since they are not constant it may be necessary to rebalance the portfolio which incurs transaction costs due to buying and selling assets. There is also the risk that as an investor or fund manager diversifies, their ability to monitor and understand the assets may decline leading to the possibility of losses due to poor decisions or unforeseen correlations. Hedging Hedging is a method for reducing risk where a combination of assets are selected to offset the movements of each other. For instance, when investing in a stock it is possible to buy an option to sell that stock at a defined price at some point in the future. The combined portfolio of stock and option is now much less likely to move below a given value. As in diversification there is a cost, this time in buying the option for which there is a premium. Derivatives are used extensively to mitigate many types of risk. According to the article from Investopedia, a hedge is an investment designed to reduce the risk of adverse price movements in an asset. Typically, a hedge consists of taking a counter- position in a related financial instrument, such as a futures contract. The Forward Contract The forward contract is a non-standard contract to buy or sell an underlying asset between two independent parties at an agreed price and date. The Future Contract The futures contract is a standardized contract to buy or sell an underlying asset between two independent parties at an agreed price, quantity and date. Option contract The Option contract is a contract gives the buyer (the owner or holder of the option) the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset or instrument at a specified strike price prior to or on a specified date, depending on the form of the option.

The population at the 2011 census was 15,241. Geography Stapleford lies on the border between Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. To the north of Stapleford is Ilkeston and to the east is Beeston. To the west across the River Erewash is Sandiacre, and in the south is Toton. Politics Stapleford is part of Broxtowe borough and the Broxtowe Parliamentary Constituency. From 1935 until 1974 Stapleford was paired with the town of Beeston in the Beeston and Stapleford Urban District, having previously been part of the Stapleford Rural District. The town was parished in 1987 and now has a town council. The local MP is Darren Henry of the Conservative Party from December 2019, and the town is represented on Nottinghamshire County Council by the Conservative Party and also on Broxtowe Borough Council by two Labour Party, one Conservative Party and one Independent Councillor and two Liberal Democrats. The town council is a mixture of Labour Party, Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Green and 4 Independent Councillors since the election in May 2019. Brief history The place-name is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears, unusually, spelt as now, and in the Pipe Rolls of 1194 . The name means \\"ford marked by a post or posts\\".Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.439. Stapleford's origins can be traced to before the Norman Conquest.http://www.stapleford-notts.co.uk/stapleford%20history.htm In the churchyard of St Helen's church is the Stone Cross which is Saxon and believed to be the oldest Christian monument in the Midlands.http://www.stapleford- notts.co.uk/places%20of%20interest.htm Stapleford owed its development in part to its closeness to the River Trent and the River Erewash as the town became a central point for trade. The antiquary John Weever defined a staple town \\"to be a place, to which by the prince's authority and privilege wool, hides of beasts, wine, corn or grain, and other exotic or foreign merchandize are transferred, carried or conveyed to be sold.\\"Weever, Antient Funeral Monuments, section \\"Within the Diocese of Rochester:Deptford\\" (1767 ed. p 134), noting the Florentine merchant Lodovico, Guicciardini. The area also expanded in the late 18th century when the stocking hose trade thrived in the Midlands. Evidence of this history can be found today with the original Stocking Knitters' Houses still standing alongside more modern properties and shops such as on Nottingham Road. The main crossroads in Stapleford at the junction of Nottingham Road, Derby Road, Toton Lane and Church Street is called The Roach. The name is from the time when French prisoners from the Napoleonic Wars were set the task of cutting through rock to create roads and this was referred to as La Roche. Stapleford is also home to the Hemlock Stone on Stapleford Hill. It is approximately 200 million years old, dating to the Triassic Period. In 2006, a new NHS Health Centre and Walk-In Centre opened in the town, but has since closed and has been succeeded by a large multi use healthcare centre with a mental health unit and cafe on site. Sainsbury's local was opened on the site of the former Total petrol station in 2007. Stapleford is the home of the Full Mash microbrewery.

The film noir drama, filmed and set in England, stars Alex Nicol and Hillary Brooke, who are the only Americans in the cast, although Brooke plays a British character, as she did in most films. (Her mastery of a \\"posh\\" accent caused her to be typecast as British in Hollywood films starting in the 1940s.) Sid James plays a prominent supporting role in which he is, unusually for him, a \\"good guy\\". Plot An American pulp novelist, Mark Kendrick (Nicol), meets his rich neighbours across the lake and is soon seduced by beautiful blonde Carol (Brooke), the wife of Beverly Forrest (James), despite Beverly treating him as a friend. When Beverly is badly injured by a fall on his boat, Carol fails to persuade Mark to throw him overboard, so Carol does it. After first refusing to go along with her plan to call it an accident, Mark agrees when Carol tells him that they will meet up again later and live off her dead husband's money. However, after the coroner rules the death an accident, Mark does not hear from her, but the still suspicious CID inspector on the case arranges for Mark to find out that Carol has secretly married another old flame and changed residences. Mark angrily confronts her, but she sneers that she only used him and that there is nothing he can do about it without implicating himself. Mark decides to confess, thinking that, although it will probably mean a prison sentence for him, it will mean the rope for Carol.

It is a local of The Newspaper Guild/Communications Workers of America and is the largest media local union in North America. It was formerly known as The Canadian Wire Service Guild and was created in 1950 by employees of The Canadian Press. It expanded to CBC newswriters, who carried it after a decertification campaign at The Canadian Press succeeded. CP employees rejoined and won a contract in 1976. The Guild, as it has always been known, increased in size from about 700 to more than 3,000 in 1993 when CUPE and ACTRA members at the CBC voted to join. It adopted its current name in 1994. Four years later another 400 CUPE members joined the Guild and, in 2003, CBC technicians, formerly represented by Communications Energy and Paperworkers, became part of CMG in a consolidation vote. It is part of Ottawa-based CWA/SCA Canada, which is the Canadian arm of the 700,000-member Communications Workers of America, and also includes newspapers such as the Victoria Times Colonist, Montreal Gazette and Ottawa Citizen. In recent history, on August 15, 2005, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation locked out its 5500 members in the Canadian Media Guild. The key point of contention was the broadcaster's insistence on more term contract employees in the future while guaranteeing no change in employment status for existing employees. The dispute lasted eight weeks and ended with both sides compromising on this point. In August 2015, the Canadian Media Guild, became a registered third party in order to speak up for better funding for the national public broadcaster, more transparency in the appointment process for the President & CEO of CBC/Radio-Canada and its board of directors, and for CBC/Radio-Canada's arm's-length relationship and independence from the government of the day .

Hiyya. Hiyya bar Abba or Rabbi Hiyya (Hebrew: ◊®◊ë◊ô ◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ê ◊ë◊® ◊ê◊ë◊ê) was a third generation amoraic sage of the Land of Israel, of priestly descent, who flourished at the end of the third century. Biography In the Jerusalem Talmud he is also called Hiyya bar Ba or Hiyya bar Wa.Jerusalem Talmud (Berakhot 3 (6a), 4 (7d) In both Talmuds he is frequently called merely R. Hiyya. He may have briefly studied with Samuel of NehardeaWeiss, \\"Dor,\\" 3:94 in Babylon, his native land. When he was still very young, Hiyya migrated to Israel where he studied under Hanina and Joshua ben Levi. He may also have been influenced by Shimon ben Lakish. Hiyya was also a student of Rabbi Johanan. After Rabbi Johanan's death, Hiyya and his friends Rav Ammi and Rav Assi became recognized as some of Israel's brightest halakhic scholars. Hiyya was distinguished for the care with which he noted the sayings of his masters.Berachot 38b When questions arose about being faithful to tradition, Hiyya's interpretation was widely accepted.Berachot 32b, 38b Though he was the author of many aggadot, he denounced every attempt to collect and commit his tales to writing. Whenever he came upon such a collection, Hiyya cursed the hand that wrote it.Jerusalem Talmud, Shabbat 16 (15c) His focus was squarely on Halakhah. The Jerusalem Talmud relates that when the Roman emperor Diocletian visited Tyre, Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba went so far as to \\"trample over graves\\" to go out and see him.Jerusalem Talmud, Berakhot 3:1 With the help of Ammi and Assi, Hiyya formed a court of law. One day a woman named Tamar came before the court. Her case was a difficult one. The sentence handed down was controversial; Hiyya and his associates might have suffered disastrous consequences if Abbahu himself had not come to their assistance.Jerusalem Talmud, Megillah 3 (74a) Hiyya was forced to lecture from town to town in an effort to make ends meet. He even had to leave Israel temporarily.Jerusalem Talmud, Ma'aser Sheni 5 (56b) During these travels, when another lecturer on aggadah drew a bigger crowd than he did, Hiyya couldn't hide his annoyance.see Jew. Encyc. i.36, s.v. Abbahu To improve his circumstances, Hiyya accepted a commission from Judah II to collect money to help rebuild the decaying patriarchate. The esteem in which Hiyya was held is evident in a letter of introduction Eleazar ben Pedath provided for him: \\"Behold, we have sent you a great man, our envoy. Until his return he possesses all the powers that we do.\\" According to another version, the introduction read: \\"Behold, we have sent you a great man. His greatness consists in this, that he is not ashamed to say 'I know not'.\\"Jerusalem Talmud, Hagigah 1 (76d), Nedarim 10 (42b) Hiyya, Ammi, and Assi visited various communities in Israel at the behest of Judah II who entrusted them with reawakening interest in the study of Jewish Law.Jerusalem Talmud, Hagigah 1 (76c) Hiyya had several brothers: R. Nathan ha-Kohen, also known as R. Kohen (or R. Nathan) b. Abba; Rabbannai, or R. Bannai; and R. Simeon ben Abba. He had several children, including R. Abba, R. Kahanah, and R. Nehemiah.

He was active in Caesarea in the Land of Israel, from around 180 to 220 CE. His name, meaning \\"Son of Kapparah\\", was taken from his father, Eleazar ha-Kappar. He was one of the students of R' Judah haNasi, and an Amora of the first generation. He was a talented poet and storyteller, and it is said that at the wedding feast of Simeon, the son of Rebbi, he kept the guests captivated with fables until their food got cold. However, his satirical wit (he once ridiculed the son-in- law of Rebbi by telling him to ask Rebbi a riddle that really was an insulting criticism of Rebbi's household), lost him the chance to be ordained. Name His full name was Eleazar (there seems to be no ground for the form \\"Eliezer\\") ben Eleazar ha-Kappar. This is the form appearing in the tannaite sources, ToseftaTosefta Beitzah 1:7; Tosefta Hullin 6:3 and Sifre;Sifre Numbers 42, ed. Friedmann, p. 12b the usual Talmudic form, \\"Bar Kappara,\\" and the frequent appellation, \\"Eleazar ha-Kappar Berabbi\\", are abbreviations of this. According to a later source, his given name was Shimon rather than Eleazar.Netzach Yisrael 43 Biography Bar Kappara was a pupil of Judah haNasi. His teachers seem to also include R. Nathan the BabylonianMidrash Tehillim 12:4 ed. Buber; other editions and manuscripts read \\"Jonathan\\" and R. Jeremiah ben Eleazar (probably identical with the Jeremiah mentioned in the Mekhilta and Sifre).Pesikta 27 172b; Tanhuma Aharei Mot, 6 [ed. Buber, 7]; and parallel passages cited by Buber =Conflict with Judah haNasi= Bar Kappara and R' Judah haNasi seem to have been opposites in personality, with Judah haNasi's princely grandeur contrasting with Bar Kappara's poetic abandon and vivacious attitude. Perhaps as a result, the two are recorded as coming in conflict in various ways. Judah initially refused to invite Bar Kappara to the wedding of Judah's son Shimon,Nedarim 50b and after Judah changed his mind, Bar Kappara went on to mock Judah at the wedding.Nedarim 51a According to another source, Bar Kappara took revenge in a different manner: At the feast which Judah subsequently gave in Bar Kappara's honor, the latter told a vast number of fox fables (300, it is reported) and the guests left the food untouched in order to listen to him.Leviticus Rabbah 28:2 On another occasion, Bar Kappara belittled Judah in the presence of Judah's son Simon. Judah, upon hearing of this from his son, informed Bar Kappara of his firm resolve never to grant him ordination.Moed Kattan 16a The Jerusalem Talmud tells a slightly different version of this story, where Bar Kappara prompted Judah's ignorant son-in-law Ben Elasah to ask Judah the following riddle: *\\"High from Heaven her eye looks down; Constant strife excites her frown; Winged beings shun her sight; She puts youth to instant flight; The aged, too, her aspect scout; Oh! oh! the fugitive cries out. And by her snares whoever is lured, Shall never more from sin be cured!\\"Translation based on that by A. Sekles, in \\"The Poetry of the Talmud,\\" pp. 87, 88, New York, 1880. Hebrew: ◊©÷∞◊Å◊ê◊ï÷π◊ú ◊û÷¥◊©÷∏÷º◊Å◊û÷∑◊ô÷¥◊ù ◊†÷¥◊©÷∞◊Å◊ß÷∏◊§÷∏◊î, ◊î÷π◊û÷¥◊ô÷∏÷º◊î ◊ë÷∞÷º◊ô÷∑◊®÷∞◊õ÷∞÷º◊™÷µ◊ô ◊ë÷µ◊ô◊™÷∏◊î÷º, ◊û÷∑◊§÷∞◊ó÷∂◊ì÷∂◊™ ◊õ÷∏÷º◊ú ◊ë÷∑÷º◊¢÷≤◊ú÷¥◊ô ◊õ÷∞◊†÷∏◊§÷∑◊ô÷¥◊ù. ◊®÷∏◊ê◊ï÷º◊î÷∏ ◊†÷∞◊¢÷∏◊®÷¥◊ô◊ù ◊ï÷∞◊†÷∂◊ó÷∞◊ë÷∏÷º◊ê◊ï÷º, ◊ï÷¥◊ô◊©÷¥◊Å◊ô◊©÷¥◊Å◊ô◊ù ◊ß÷∏◊û◊ï÷º ◊¢÷∏◊û÷∏◊ì◊ï÷º. ◊î÷∑◊†÷∏÷º◊° ◊ô÷π◊ê◊û÷∑◊® \\"◊î◊ï÷π ◊î◊ï÷π\\", ◊ï÷∞◊î÷∑◊†÷¥÷º◊ú÷∞◊õ÷∏÷º◊ì ◊†÷¥◊ú÷∞◊õ÷∑÷º◊ì ◊ë÷∑÷º◊¢÷≤◊ï÷π◊†◊ï÷π. When Judah turned round after hearing the riddle, he discovered Bar Kappara smiling, and exclaimed: \\"I do not recognize you, old one!\\" (meaning also, \\"I do not recognize you as an elder, a sage!\\"). Bar Kappara understood from this that he would never receive ordination.Yerushalmi Moed Kattan 3:1 81c What the riddle really signifies is not known, despite many attempts to explain it. The most probable view is Abraham Krochmal's, that Bar Kappara intended it as a criticism of Judah's unrelenting severity toward young and old. The verse is notable as an example of Hebrew poetry in Talmudic times; its few lines may be the sole testimony to the activity of the Jews of that time in secular poetry. Its language is classic, but not slavishly so; forceful and pure, yet easy and flowing. Curiously, the one other preserved example of Bar Kappara's poetry is the eloquent words in which he proclaimed Judah haNasi's death to the assembled people of Sepphoris: \\"Brethren of the house of Jedaiah [an epithet of the inhabitants of Sepphoris], listen to me! Mortals and angels have long been wrestling for the possession of the holy tablets of the Law; the angels have conquered. They have captured the tablets\\".Yerushalmi Kilaim 9 32b; Yerushalmi Ketuvot 12 35a; Bavli Ketuvot 104a; Ecclesiastes Rabbah 7:11, 9:10, with many variants of the text, which is here given according to Ecclesiastes Rabbah l.c. Bar Kappara's presence in Sepphoris suggests that, despite Judah's attitude toward him, he appreciated his great obligations to his teacher; and that his grief for Judah's death was sincere. =Activity in Caesarea= His conflicts with Judah haNasi induced him to leave the Galilee for Caesarea. The academy he set up there came to be a serious rival of Judah haNasi's. Among the most important of its scholars were Hoshayah, \\"the father of the Mishnah\\",Keritut 8a and Joshua ben Levi, the distinguished aggadist, who to a large extent transmitted Bar Kappara's aggadic teachings.Shabbat 75a The greatest admirers of Judah haNasi and supporters of Judah's patriarchial house, Hanina bar Hama and Johanan ben Nappaha, could not refrain from acknowledging Bar Kappara's greatness.Niddah 20a; Avodah Zarah 31a It is related of him that once while walking on the mole of Caesarea and seeing a Roman that had escaped from shipwreck in utter destitution, he took him to his house and provided him with clothing and all necessaries, including money. Later this castaway became proconsul of Caesarea, and occasion soon offered itself to show his gratitude to his rescuer, when Jews involved in a political disturbance were arrested, and he released them on Bar Kappara's intervention.Ecclesiastes Rabbah 11:1, on \\"Cast thy bread upon the waters\\" Upon Bar Kappara's death, Rabbi Yohanan went to Parod (◊§◊®◊ï◊ì or ◊§◊ê◊®◊ï◊ì) in order to question people who may have remembered sayings that were passed down in the name of Bar Kappara.Avodah Zarah 31a Nothing further is known of this place; Bacher\\"Agada der Tannaiten,\\" ii. 505 suggests it may have been a suburb of Caesarea. Teachings Bar Kappara was particularly known to the amoraim as the author of a compilation called the Mishnah of Bar Kappara.Pesikta 15 122a; Yerushalmi Horayot 3 48c; and many other places. This work has not been preserved, and probably at the final redaction of the Talmud it was no longer extant.Meiri, in commentary on Avot (ed. Vilna, p. 14) does not mention the fact of having had such a Mishnah collection [thus Schorr, \\"He-·∏§alu·∫ì,\\" i. 44, and A. Krochmal, ib. iii. 118], but a Baraita cited in Bar Kappara's name in the Talmud. In fact, it is questionable whether the work ever reached Babylonia, as the one passage in the Bavli referring to it originated with Shimon ben Lakish, a Palestinian.Bava Batra 154b In any case, the numerous passages from his Mishnah that found their way into the Talmud suffice for judgment upon its character. Menachem Meiril.c. quite correctly designates it as a supplement to the Mishnah of Judah haNasi, intended chiefly to explain it, and, on rare occasions, to give differing opinions (see Baraita). It also presented variants to Judah haNasi's Mishnah, and later on became occasionally so interwoven in the text of the latter that doubt arose whether the Mishnah in question belonged to the one or to the other.Yerushalmi Pesachim 10 37d The Mishnah of Bar Kappara was also used by the redactor of the Tosefta, who derived many decisions from it.For instances, see Weiss, \\"Dor Dor we-Dorshaw,\\" ii. 219 Is. Halevy, however, denies the existence of Bar Kappara's Mishnah,\\"Dorot ha-Rishonim,\\" ii. 123‚Äì125 without sufficient reason. Bar Kappara ascribed great value to the study of astronomy: \\"He who can calculate the solstices and movements of the planets and fails to pay attention to these things, to him may be applied the verse (Isaiah 5:12) 'They regard not the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands\\".Shabbat 75a This statement is particularly striking when compared to his opinion about the obligation to study Torah: that a Jew who reads just two portions from the Torah daily‚Äîone in the morning and one in the evening‚Äîfulfills the commandment to meditate in God's law by day and night.Psalms 1:2; Midrash Tehillim on 1:2 Bar Kappara appreciated not only natural science, but also the Greek love of the beautiful. He explained Genesis 9:27 as follows: \\"The words of the Torah should be recited in the speech of Japheth (i.e. Greek) in the tents of Shem (i.e. in the synagogues and schools)\\".Genesis Rabbah 36:8 Bar Kappara's respect for the exact sciences was equaled by his aversion for metaphysical speculation, which in his time flourished among Jews and Christians in the form of gnosis. Referring to Deuteronomy 4:32 (\\"Ask now of the past days, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth\\") Bar Kappara says, \\"Seek to know only of those days that followed Creation; but seek not to know what went before\\".Genesis Rabbah 1:10 The Jerusalem Talmud contains a prayer he wrote and included in the repetition of the 18th section of Thanksgiving in the Amidah.Yerushalmi Brachot 1:5 The sayings of Bar Kappara regarding the incense offering (qetoret) are recited thrice daily by Sephardi Jews (before and after Shacharit, and before Mincha); twice daily by Hasidic Jews (before Shacharit, and before Mincha); and once daily by Ashkenazi Jews (before Shacharit).Online Siddur = Quotes = * Which is a brief passage upon which all fundamentals of the Torah are dependent? \\"In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct your paths\\" (Proverbs 3:6).Berakhot 63b * A man should always teach his son a clean and easy profession.Berakhot 63a References * Encyclopaedia Judaica, 1972, Keter Publishing House, Jerusalem, Israel. * Sefer Ha-Aggadah (Book of Legends), 1992, Schocken, New York. =Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography= * Bacher, Agada der Tannaiten, ii. 503‚Äì520 (for other passages in the same, see the Index); * Br√ºll, Mebo ha-Mishnah, i. 244, 289‚Äì292; * Frankel, Darke ha- Mishnah, p. 313; * idem, Mebo, 20a et seq., 71a; * Gr√§tz, Gesch. der Juden, 4th ed., iv. 198, 199, 211; * Hamburger, Supplement to R.

He served on the U.S. Army General Staff from the Great War, when he was a major, to the Second Great War, which he began as a colonel. Abell disliked many of the tactics and operations proposed by Irving Morrell, but the two men shared a hatred of the Confederacy and a wary respect for each other's abilities. Abell is typically portrayed as an excellent soldier in his role as a General Staff officer, but is an occasional antagonist to Irving Morrell and Abner Dowling, both field officers, as their approaches to war differ radically. However, Abell and Dowling make common cause with regard to Daniel MacArthur's debacle in northern Virginia. Dowling and Abell even appear to become friends (to the extent that either man has friends), both men sharing an ironic sense of humor and low regard for MacArthur. During the war, Abell was promoted twice: first to brigadier general, then to major general. After the war ended, it was his duty to inform General Abner Dowling of the possibility that Dowling retire. =Blackford, Hosea= (HFR, GW:B-AE:VO) Hosea Blackford was first introduced in HFR in a train ride across the northern Great Plains at 1881, while talking with former US President Abraham Lincoln, a founder of American Socialism whose disciple the earnest young Blackford considers himself to be. Blackford re-entered the series in GW:B when, as a Congressman in the House of Representatives for the Socialist Party (representing Dakota), he became friendly with freshman Congresswoman Flora Hamburger (S-New York), developing a romantic relationship. They ultimately married despite religious and political differences (Hosea was Protestant while Flora was Jewish). They would later have a son named Joshua. In 1920, he was asked by presidential candidate Upton Sinclair to be the Socialist Party nominee to be the Vice President. The Socialists defeated Democratic incumbent Theodore Roosevelt, who was running for a third term. Sinclair and Blackford were re-elected in 1924. Blackford described the job as being a \\"$12,000 a year hatrack.\\" In 1928, Blackford became the Socialist Party nominee for President with Hiram Johnson as his running mate while the Democratics nominated Calvin Coolidge of Massachusetts. Blackford defeated Coolidge by a small margin and became the 30th president after finally taking Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Socialists also carried New York, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Colorado, and California. The Democrats were able to capture all six of the New England states (including Coolidge's home and birth states of Massachusetts and Vermont), Kentucky, Houston, Kansas, Montana, Idaho, and Nevada. It was a closer race than the 1924 election had been, but Coolidge ultimately conceded to Blackford over the telephone. While conceding, Coolidge predicted that the bull market could not last and that a dramatic crash was certain. Blackford naively dismissed Coolidge's predictions believing that the Socialists had enacted adequate safety measures. However, history proved Coolidge right as an economic panic and subsequent stock market crash came in late 1929. The crash and depression were largely blamed on Blackford. Shantytowns of unemployed people in the United States become known as Blackfordburghs in honor of the failure of the Blackford Presidency. In response he tried passing make-work legislation, but nothing helped. The fact that the Democrat-controlled Congress defeated most of those make-work bills did not help matters much. Things were made even worse for Blackford in 1932 when the caught a disguised Japanese ship supplying weapons to Canada's resistance. The Japanese responded by sneak attacking Los Angeles. This destroyed Blackford's hopes of reelection, and began the Pacific War. Blackford was easily defeated by Calvin Coolidge for the Presidential spot in 1932. However, Coolidge never got to become the 31st president. He died on January 5, 1933 (the same date as he died in real life) of a heart attack, less than a month before he could be inaugurated president on February 1. This resulted in Coolidge's running mate Herbert Hoover becoming the 31st president, instead. After Hoover became president, Blackford retired to Dakota, and then returned to New York and Philadelphia with his wife, Flora, when she was elected to Congress in 1934 after a six-year absence. He died in 1937, shortly after Alfred E. Smith succeeded Hoover as President. Incumbent President Smith, and both Sinclair and Hoover, who were the only living former US Presidents, served as Blackford's pallbearers. =Blackford, Joshua= (AE:CCH-SA:ID) Joshua Blackford was the son of President of the United States Hosea Blackford and Congresswoman Flora Blackford. He lived most of his life in Philadelphia. He was born in 1925. During the Second Great War, he was conscripted into the US Army shortly after his 18th birthday in 1943. His mother immediately offered to find a way to disqualify him from conscription despite her support of the war; she had refused to do the same thing for her brother (Joshua's uncle), David Hamburger, during the Great War, which she did not support. Blackford refused his mother's offer and joined the Army. In the fall of 1943, he was still in training when General Irving Morrell's forces entered Georgia. Despite the success of Morrell's offensive, Blackford was sent into combat. He was injured in 1944, losing the middle finger of his left hand. He was taken to a military hospital in Thayer, Missouri. =Bliss, Luther= (GW:WH-GW:B, AE:CCH, SA:RE, SA:G-SA:ID) Luther Bliss was a Kentuckian who sided with the occupying US forces during the Great War. He became head of the Kentucky State Police and was instrumental in persuading a rump legislature to petition for re-entry into the United States. During the years before the war, Bliss used his power effectively and ruthlessly to crack down on black Marxists and Confederate saboteurs alike. He left when Kentucky voted to rejoin the Confederate States, but returned to Covington during the 1941 war to coordinate sabotage missions against Confederate armed forces. In 1943, with US forces approaching the Ohio River, he was in conference with Intelligence officers to coordinate a rising behind the Confederate lines and help the US invasion. At the end of the war, Bliss was still present in Covington, where he had one final run-in with his old sometime-nemesis-sometime-ally Cincinnatus Driver, whom he did not trust. =Carsten, Sam= (Viewpoint character, GW:AF-SA:ID) Sam Carsten was a member of a gun crew on the battleship USS Dakota during the Great War. He was also a member of a landing party that overran the British coastal defenses at Pearl Harbor in the Sandwich Islands, as well as serving in the Battle of the Three Navies. Falling into conversation with a friendly surfing Hawaiian native while on leave, Carsten suspected him of being a British spy and reported the encounter to his superior officers. Upon investigation, his suspicions were confirmed, which led to the Hawaiian's arrest and execution, and resulted in Carsten's promotion for his initiative. After the war, he was transferred to the aircraft carrier , where he served as a gun captain during the suppression of a pro-British rebellion in Ulster. Carsten was selected for Officer Candidate School and was commissioned in 1924. He served as a damage-control officer aboard the Remembrance during the Pacific War, until its sinking during the American defeat off Midway in 1941. Carsten was then appointed commanding officer of the destroyer escort USS Josephus Daniels, which served in several actions in the Atlantic, including transporting U.S. Marine Corps raiders to capture a working Confederate coastal Y-range (radar) station, as well as intercepting British attempts to land arms to the Canadian resistance in Newfoundland. After these successful missions, the Daniels was chosen to run guns to rebels in Confederate Cuba by disguising her as a Confederate warship. The ship later takes part in a large naval battle in the Atlantic between the U.S. Navy and combined British and French naval forces, followed by a mission to smuggle arms into British-occupied Ireland. During the final stages of the war, Carsten and the Josephus Daniels play a major role in the mid-ocean transfer of vital German superbomb research into American hands, and helped in the liberation of Haiti which had been brutalized by CSA invasions. After the war ended, he was promoted to lieutenant commander, and assigned to patrol the occupied CSA east coast. Near the end of Settling Accounts: In at the Death it is implied that he has developed melanoma due to decades of his fair skin being exposed to the sun, as he absentmindedly picks a bleeding mole on the back of his left hand. =DeFrancis, Terry= (SA:G-ID) Terry DeFrancis was a colonel in the US Army in 1943, specializing in aircraft. He was assigned to General Dowling's Eleventh Army in west Texas to support the drive on Camp Determination. He was very young to be a full colonel, and still very young when promoted to commander of the 11th Army after Dowling departed to attack Richmond again. Much as DeFrancis's use of fighter-bombers and heavy bombers proves key to providing Dowling the edge over the Confederates in west Texas, now the recreated US state of Houston. =Dowling, Abner= (Viewpoint character, GW:AF-SA:ID) Abner Dowling was a major in the US Army in 1914, serving as Lieutenant General George Custer's adjutant. Physically overweight, Dowling was the butt of many of Custer's jokes, and his rather-good judgment on military matters was overlooked or denounced as \\"stupid\\" by the 75-year-old war hero, who used his First Army as a commander would use the obsolete cavalry: charge straight at the target and full steam ahead. Dowling recognized that strategy as costly and inefficient, but could only influence Custer indirectly. After three years of brutal advancing through western Kentucky and into northern Tennessee, First Army stood in front of Nashville. Custer, following the advice of Colonel Irving Morrell, began to mass his armor, contrary to US War Department doctrine. Dowling was coerced by Custer into faking reports to the War Department about how the general was allocating his armor and between them they convinced the General Staff and President Theodore Roosevelt to believe these reports. Custer went on to win the USA's first major victory of the Great War: the Barrel Roll Offensive. The First Army then captured Nashville and was planning a march on Murfreesboro when the Confederates asked for an armistice. Following the end of the Great War, Dowling was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and Custer to full general. After spending time in the War Department offices, Custer and Dowling were transferred to Winnipeg, Manitoba, which had been set up by the victorious Americans as the capital of Occupied Canada. Custer became governor-general, while Dowling typed his reports. Following two assassination attempts by a Canadian farmer named Arthur McGregor, who was ultimately killed by his intended target, Custer was forced by the new President Upton Sinclair to retire, and Dowling became army-commandant of Salt Lake City with the rank of colonel. Following the 1929 assassination of Utah Governor-general John Pershing, Dowling became the military governor. After several more years, military rule in the state was lifted and Dowling was reassigned once more. As his experience in Utah was unique among most of his peers, Dowling became the head of US military forces fighting Freedom Party rebels in Kentucky. After the Richmond Agreement of June 1940 between Presidents Al Smith and Jake Featherston, a plebiscite took place and Kentucky voted for a return to the Confederacy. With war clouds between North and South looming, the now- brigadier general became commander of the Army of Ohio, in charge of defending the Midwest. On June 22, 1941, the Confederates invaded Ohio with barrels and troops. Being unsupplied and unsupported by the War Department, the Army of Ohio was rolled back as the Confederates blitzed to Sandusky, Ohio, on the south shore of Lake Erie, cutting the USA in half. Dowling was blamed for the disaster, but with War Department assistance, he appeared before the Congressional Committee on the Joint Conduct of the War, and pointed out the budget cuts of the Sinclair and Blackford Administrations as a significant cause of the U.S. defeat. Instead of being cashiered in disgrace, he was placed under the command of Daniel MacArthur, who led an inept counterattack in Northern Virginia. Dowling managed to prevent George Patton, from striking MacArthur's rear, saving the Rappahannock front from destruction as MacArthur pushed south. 1942 found Brigadier General Dowling being promoted to Major General, then being put charge of the 11th Army headquartered in Clovis, New Mexico. The 11th Army began an offensive into West Texas to coincide with the U.S. counter-attack around Pittsburgh. Shortly after the fighting in Pittsburgh ended, Dowling and his army learned of the existence of Camp Determination through photographic evidence. This struck a nerve in Dowling, who then used whatever resources he could to advance through Texas and get to the camp. By the time Dowling could seize Amarillo and Snyder, the Confederates destroyed the camp and most of the evidence that was there. This did not stop Dowling from forcing prominent local citizens from touring the mass graves of several hundred thousand black victims of Featherston. After the invasion of Texas was halted by limited resources and the vast amounts of empty land, Dowling was sent to command an army in the final attack on Virginia. In 1944, after the war ended, Dowling was approached by Major General John Abell and it was made clear that Dowling must retire to make room for younger officers. Abell noted that Dowling's work significantly changed the moral nature of the war from merely a defense of the United States to a moral crusade against Featherston and his ideology. Dowling is portrayed as an excellent officer who is often forced to work with limited resources and relegated to sideshow fronts and operations, and as such his results tend to be less than spectacular or decisive. Despite these limitations, (most the result of an unfortunate tendency to speak his mind) he almost always achieves his objectives and enjoys the professional respect of the fearsome Confederate General George Patton. He has an ironic sense of humor and is a close ally of Irving Morrell. =Driver, Cincinnatus= (Viewpoint character, GW:AF-SA:ID) Born in Covington, Kentucky, CSA, Cincinnatus, who like most CSA Blacks, had no surname, worked as a delivery driver before the Great War. When Covington was overrun by U.S. forces, Cincinnatus found himself working for Lieutenant Straubing as a military driver, but also being a pawn in the intelligence game between Confederates, black Marxists, and U.S. forces in Kentucky. Luther Bliss, head of the United States's new Kentucky State Police, detained him on suspicion of espionage but was freed after a personal intervention by US President Theodore Roosevelt. Following the Great War, when Kentucky became part of the USA, and its Blacks were allowed to take surnames, Cincinnatus chose the name Driver after his profession and moved to Des Moines, Iowa, where he set up business as a hauler. In the mid 1920s, he was briefly lured back to Kentucky by Luther Bliss and once again imprisoned without charge for several months, but this time was freed due to the legal efforts of attorney Clarence Darrow. Driver returned to Kentucky in late 1940 to see to a family crisis, but was trapped behind the international border when the Confederates reoccupied the state. He and his father, Seneca Driver, were exchanged in 1942 and he returned to Des Moines, where he volunteered as a civilian auxiliary driver for the U.S. Army, this time being allowed to carry a weapon. After a brief interlude assisting in the planning of underground operations in Covington, Kentucky, with Bliss (his one-time nemesis, now something of a grudging ally), Driver followed the Army into Tennessee and Georgia, enthusiastically seeing the reactions of Confederates who saw a black man carrying a weapon. After the war, Driver returned to Covington one last time, saddened to see that all his friends had apparently been killed in the recent genocide, except for two men whom he suspected of \\"selling out\\" all the other Blacks, before returning home to Des Moines to see his daughter, Amanda, get married. =Engels Brothers= (AE:CCH, SA:RE-SA:ID) The Engels Brothers are a comedy group and common cultural icon. The Engels brothers apparently served in the Great War in the trenches, and then became a vaudeville act in the United States. They appeared in stage plays and movies and recorded an anti- Confederate number, \\"Featherston's Follies.\\" They are noted for wearing beards dyed in many different colors. The Engels Brothers are analogous to the Marx Brothers, and are named after the long-time writing partner of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels. =Enos, George Sr.= (Viewpoint character GW:AF-GW:B) George Enos was a fisherman from Boston, Massachusetts, on the F/V Ripple when the Great War began. He continued to fish until the Ripple was captured by a Confederate commerce raider, the CSS Swamp Fox, and was interned in North Carolina until exchanged. Enos joined the U.S. Navy shortly afterward to avoid conscription in the army and to fight the Confederacy. He served on a Q-boat which sank a Confederate submarine, and in 1916 was transferred to the USS Punishment, a river monitor which fought on the Mississippi and Cumberland Rivers, until it was destroyed. Enos was not aboard at the time. He was then transferred to the destroyer USS Ericsson, which was sunk illegally after the U.S.-C.S. armistice of 1917 by the CSS Bonefish, captained by Roger Kimball. =Enos, George Jr.= (GW:AF-AE:VO; Viewpoint character AE:VO-SA:ID) George Enos Jr. was born in 1910 and was only 7 years old when his father, George Enos Sr., was killed when the USS Ericsson was illegally torpedoed on the day after the U.S.-C.S. armistice. The tragedy of the Enos family acquired notoriety after Junior's mother Sylvia struck down the murderer and was acquitted for justifiable homicide in 1923. Junior became a fisherman like his father before him, married Connie McGillicuddy, and joined the U.S. Navy in 1941 to avoid conscription into the Army, seeing action in the Sandwich Islands, which were being threatened by the Japanese, aboard the destroyer USS Townsend. In 1943, the Townsend was sunk near Baja California in a direct hit by Confederate divebomber. Enos survived and was transferred to the USS Josephus Daniels, under the command of Sam Carsten, whom he recognized from a chance encounter in his childhood. In 1944, Enos was transferred again, this time to the USS Oregon. With the intervention of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., an admirer of Sylvia Enos, Enos Jr. was able to obtain his release from the navy after the Second Great War concluded, after which he returned home to Boston. =Enos, Sylvia= (Viewpiont character, GW:AF-AE:VO) Sylvia Enos, born in 1886, was the wife and widow of Boston fisherman and U.S. Navy man George Enos Senior. After his death in 1917, she struggled to support her two children. In 1923, thanks to complex developments in Confederate politics surrounding resistance to the Freedom Party, she learned the identity of the Confederate Navy officer who illegally killed her husband on the USS Ericsson, Roger Kimball. Sylvia traveled to South Carolina and killed Kimball, then surrendered to authorities. She was spared prosecution through the intervention of Anne Colleton, a political rival and ex-lover of Kimball. Following her return, she became a heroine. Boston Democrat boss Joseph P. Kennedy exploited her fame for political uses and also tried and failed to seduce her. She ghost-wrote a book entitled I Sank Roger Kimball along with a frustrated writer named Ernie. Against the advice of her son George Enos Junior, she began a romantic and sexual affair with Ernie, who had been wounded in his genitalia during the Great War. She was frightened by Ernie's dark mood swings but resisted her son's advice to break off the affair. This ultimately proved fatal one day in 1939 when, in a very black melancholy, Ernie accidentally shot and killed Sylvia, during his own suicide. =Grimes, Armstrong= (AE:BI-AE:VO; Viewpoint character AE:VO-SA:ID) Armstrong Grimes (named after George Armstrong Custer) is the son of Merle Grimes and Edna Grimes and the grandson of Nellie Semphroch. He grew up in Washington, D.C. He graduated from high school in 1940 and then spent the next year of his life looking for work with little success, until he was conscripted into the U.S. Army in 1941. His basic training facility was attacked on the first day of the war as part of Operation Blackbeard, at which point he was awarded the rank of Private First Class. He took part in the initial, unsuccessful defense of Ohio under General Abner Dowling. When Sandusky fell, marking the conclusion of that operation, he was transferred to Utah, which had recently erupted into a Mormon uprising. There he befriended Yossel Reisen Jr., the nephew of Flora Hamburger. In Utah he was involved in both heavy fighting and terrorist attacks, eventually attaining the rank of sergeant. After the Mormons surrendered in 1943, Grimes was transferred to Canada, where he was wounded. After recovery, he was sent to Tennessee to take part in the U.S. push into Georgia. Grimes ended the war in Alabama, and remained there as part of the U.S. occupying force in the state. =Hamburger, Flora (Blackford)= (Viewpoint character, GW:AF-SA:ID) Flora Hamburger is the wife of US President Hosea Blackford and a major political figure in her own right. At the beginning of the series she is a Socialist grassroots activist and agitator in a working-class Jewish neighborhood of New York City, a member of the party's left-wing who is opposed to the leadership's decision to vote credits for the just-started war. In 1916, Hamburger takes the quite daring decision to contest the race for the area's Congressional seat and wins, becoming one of just two women in the United States House of Representatives. On arrival in Philadelphia, the de facto capital, she is welcomed by the experienced and far older Congressman Hosea Blackford, member of the party's more moderate wing from the State of Dakota. They develop a romantic relationship and finally marry. Hamburger refuses an offer by General Leonard Wood to have her brother, David Hamburger, transferred out of the front line because her Socialist principles forbid her from accepting special favors; later, David loses a leg in battle. She is often called the \\"Conscience of the Congress.\\" She opposed the repression of the Mormons of Utah, for example, and she vainly tries to draw the attention of U.S. public opinion to the plight of Blacks in the Confederacy, even before the rise of Jake Featherston. During the 1930s, although her earlier belief in the inevitable revolution of the proletariat has been tempered somewhat by age and experience, she is seen as the only member of Congress who really seems to care about the revival of the CSA and the rise of the Freedom Party. An independently active First Lady, she refuses to be sidelined after her husband was defeated in the 1932 election, fell to ill health, and died in 1937, leaving her with one son, Joshua. She quickly resumes her old seat and her Congressional career in 1934. In 1941, she noticed a peculiar budget item appropriating a large amount of money for a secret project in Hanford, Washington. She used this to strike a deal with President Al Smith which forced the president to publicly condemn the Confederate atrocities against Southern blacks. Throughout 1942 and 1943, Blackford found herself agreeing more with Democratic Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio about taking a hard line towards the war and towards the Mormon rebellion in Utah. Her son was drafted into the Army in 1943, and she felt some guilt after he was wounded (though not seriously) in the closing days of the war. Blackford was among the members of Congress to tour the site of the superbomb attack on the outskirts of Philadelphia in 1944. She spent much of the postwar 1944 campaigning for her re-election to Congress (which she won) and for Charles W. La Follete's election bid (which he lost). She gave a speech in Congress expressing thanks to the black guerrilla Cassius Madison for killing Jake Featherston, and was present at the inauguration of Thomas E. Dewey on February 1, 1945. =Ironhewer= (SA:ID) General Ironhewer of the United States Army, accepted the surrender of Confederate General George Patton in Birmingham, Alabama the closing days of the Second Great War in July 1944. Ironhewer was a long-faced bald man. Ironhewer's name is a literal translation of the German Eisenhower, and his brief description suggests a similarity to the real life U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower. =Jacobs, Hal= (GW:AF-AE:CCH) Hal Jacobs was a cobbler in Washington, D.C., during the Great War. He was an agent for the spy ring for the U.S. run by Bill Reach, with Nellie Semphroch a fellow agent who reported to him. Jacobs was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his actions, despite being a civilian, by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1921. He married Nellie after the Great War, and died of lung cancer in 1933. He and Nellie Semphroch had a daughter, Clara. =La Follette, Charles W.= (AE:VO - SA:ID) The fourth Socialist President of the United States, Charles W. La Follette was elected Vice President of the United States in 1936 and served from 1937 until the death of President Al Smith in 1942. LaFollete also promised to keep the agreement between his office and Flora Blackford on the African-American holocaust in return for her keeping quiet about the atomic bomb project in western Washington State. After the U.S. made significant progress in 1943, invading Kentucky, Tennessee, and capturing Camp Determination, La Follette demanded Jake Featherston's surrender. Featherston responded by firing two rockets into Philadelphia. As the war was drawing to a close, La Follete issued an executive order barring discrimination in the armed forces on the basis of race. He also pledged to introduce civil rights legislation into Congress to protect all blacks under U.S. jurisdiction. Though he led the U.S. to victory in 1944, La Follette was defeated by Thomas E. Dewey and his running mate Harry S. Truman in the Presidential election later that year. This might be intended to parallel the real world defeat of Winston Churchill at the close of World War II by Clement Attlee in 1945. Readers have long debated this character's connection to the historical La Follette family of Wisconsin. In May 2018, Turtledove settled the matter by explaining that Charles W. is a fictional son of Robert M. La Follette, Sr., and is primarily modeled on Robert M. La Follette, Jr., much in the way that Daniel MacArthur is a fictional analog of Douglas MacArthur.https://twitter.com/HNTurtledove/status/1000485494503849985 =Lavochkin, Boris= (SA:G - SA:ID) Lieutenant Boris Lavochkin was assigned as a platoon leader to the infantry company Chester Martin served in as first sergeant. He was an aggressive, violent man who enjoyed leading raids across the lines and attacking both civilians and military targets in South Carolina, and apparently had no sense of conscience or remorse. At times, he threatened his own men with violence if they did not cooperate, and he had to be threatened himself from leading a raid into Charleston, South Carolina when the unit was halted to allow a nuclear bomb attack on the city. =MacArthur, Daniel= (GW:WH-GW:B, AE:VO-SA:DE, SE:ID) During the Great War Daniel MacArthur became the youngest division commander in the history of the US Army and a newspaper hero. This achievement was overshadowed somewhat by his serving under First Army commander George Custer, also a publicity-conscious personality who ensured that MacArthur did not win any major victories. MacArthur was eclipsed still further when Lieutenant-Colonel Irving Morrell succeeded in using innovative tactics and barrels to break the Confederate lines in early 1917. MacArthur spent the 1930s as commandant of the new US state of Houston. Despite his best efforts he never entirely stopped the flow of Freedom Party men and weapons from Texas, but open rioting and revolt was ruthlessly crushed wherever it occurred. After Houston's return to Texas and the CSA and the subsequent outbreak of war in 1941, MacArthur was assigned to lead the US offensive in Virginia. The assault on northern Virginia failed in its objective of seizing Richmond, though MacArthur did succeed in crossing the Rappahannock. Heavy casualties on both sides and a failed Confederate counter-attack out of the Appalachians resulted in stalemate by Christmas. MacArthur was still confident of victory, even colluding with Rear Admiral William Halsey, Jr. about the scheme of landing troops at the mouth of the James River and advancing on Richmond from the rear. His subordinate Abner Dowling managed to prevent this, leaving northern Virginia as of February 1942 in stalemate. MacArthur launched two direct assaults into the heavily defended Confederate line at Fredericksburg, losing thousands of US soldiers to Confederate guns positioned on Marye's Heights above the town. The general was criticized heavily by the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, by Brigadier General Dowling, and by the press for his actions. In 1944, General MacArthur finally succeeded in his drive into Richmond, after the Confederacy was exhausted and forced to fight on several fronts. He victoriously led an attack capturing most of Virginia. General Abner Dowling served as a commander under MacArthur in this phase. MacArthur was known for the plainness of his uniform, and his trademark cigarette in a holder, similar to the main timeline Douglas MacArthur. Turtledove has explained that Douglas' birth was prevented in this timeline due to his parents being from opposing nations, so his fictitious half-brother Daniel took his place. =Mantarakis, Paul= (Viewpoint character, GW:AF-GW:WH) Born in Philadelphia but proud of his Greek heritage, Chef Paul Mantarakis was conscripted as a private in the U.S. Army, serving in the West with Gordon McSweeney during the early part of the Great War. There was some friction between the two when the fanatically Presbyterian McSweeney, an outspoken religious bigot who railed particularly against Roman Catholicism, mistook Mantarakis' Greek Orthodox prayer for a Latin liturgy. Ultimately, everyone in the unit learned to take McSweeney's phobia in stride and not let it harm their working relationship, and McSweeney acknowledged that Mantarakis was a steadfast comrade in arms, although he distrusted his religion. Mantarakis rose to sergeant in fighting against the Mormon rebels in 1915 up until the Mormons' surrender and Utah's placement under martial law (which would last until 1937). Mantarakis was killed during a U.S. invasion of Baja California in 1916, and McSweeney took up his \\"viewpoint slot\\" in the story. =Martin, Chester= (Viewpoint character: GW:AF-SA:ID) Chester Martin was the son of Stephen Douglas Martin and a steelworker in Toledo, Ohio. He served on the Roanoke, Virginia (\\"Big Lick\\") front during the Great War and received a commendation for saving the life of US President Theodore Roosevelt, in an analog of how Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. saved Abraham Lincoln in the 1864 of our timeline. In 1917, as a sergeant, he briefly served as a company commander of B Company, 91st Infantry Regiment, taking part in the Remembrance Day offensive. After the war, Martin returned to his civilian job in Toledo, Ohio, as a steelworker. He became a Socialist Party member and union organizer, taking part in strikes and fighting company police and strikebreakers, as well as the police, during the 1920s. Martin married Rita Habicht, who had lost her first husband in the Great War, in 1926; their son, Carl, was born in 1936. The Depression of 1929 saw Martin lose his job; he and his wife went to Los Angeles, where he began in construction work and became a union official. When the 1941 war started, Martin returned to the Army and served as a first sergeant in the infantry, fighting in Ohio and taking part in the successful counterattack against Confederate forces there. He is shown fighting at the front lines throughout Kentucky and Tennessee and eventually ends up commanding a platoon. Throughout 1944, Martin was part of the drive to Savannah, Georgia, and participated in the burning of Hardeeville, South Carolina and the murder of most of its citizens, instigated by Martin's much- younger superior, the psychopathic Lt. Boris Lavochkin. Martin briefly considered staging an accident to assassinate Lavochkin afterward, but never summoned the courage. He was saved from being in Charleston, SC when it was destroyed by a superbomb, when the foolhardy Lavochkin was ordered to halt several miles from the city. After the war ended, Martin was able to obtain his release from the Army and returned to Los Angeles, where he resumed negotiating labor contracts. He decided to keep his less-savory deeds a secret from his wife and son. =McKenna, Walter= (GW:B-AE:BI) Walter McKenna served as vice president under Democratic President Theodore Roosevelt from 1913 to 1921, which included the Great War. He was described as an \\"amiable non-entity who was almost as fat as Congressman William Howard Taft\\". Originally elected vice president under Roosevelt in 1912 and reelected in 1916, he and Roosevelt were defeated in bid for a third term in the 1920 election by the Socialist ticket of Upton Sinclair and Hosea Blackford. In The Great War: Breakthroughs, he is mistakenly referred to as Kennan. =McSweeney, Gordon= (GW:AF-GW:WH; Viewpoint character, GW:WH-GW:B) Gordon McSweeney was a U.S. Army soldier who served in Utah and Baja California with Paul Mantarakis, and later in Arkansas during the Great War. A conservative Presbyterian, McSweeney was an outspoken religious bigot, particularly against Roman Catholicism, and saw himself as the instrument of God. He eschewed all reading material except for the Bible, regarding even basic newspapers as dirty, and his favorite song was \\"A Mighty Fortress is our God.\\" Friction was caused between McSweeney and Mantarakis when the former mistook the latter's Greek Orthodox prayer for a Latin liturgy, but the Scot ultimately came to recognize the Grecian as a good brother in arms, even while distrusting his religion. McSweeney saw the enemy, whether they were Mormon, Mexican, or Confederates, as persons to be slaughtered without pity or mercy. He would use flamethrowers on enemy bunkers, for example, but also used them on trench patrols. McSweeney, a stickler for the smallest regulations, was as hard on his own soldiers as he was on himself and the enemy; despite this, his fighting skills were highly respected by his platoon and the Army as a whole. He was commissioned while serving in Arkansas, and won the Medal of Honor twice during the Great War, the second awarded for destroying a Confederate river gunboat single-handedly. McSweeney was killed by shellfire during the last days of the Great War. =Morrell, Irving= (Viewpoint character, GW:AF- SA:ID) Born in late 1891, Irving Morrell graduated from West Point. At the outbreak of the Great War he was a captain on the southwest border. Leading his company against a Confederate farmhouse in Sonora in September 1914, Morrell was severely wounded in the thigh, and would permanently suffer from a slight limp. While in the hospital he and a doctor jointly proposed the idea of metal helmets after a conversation concerning head wounds. Upon his recovery in 1915, Morrell was dispatched to eastern Kentucky, where his aggressive tactics resulted in a posting to the General Staff. Morrell's star rose still further that year when President Theodore Roosevelt, after an informal talk about the ongoing Mormon uprising in Utah, 'persuaded' the War Department to adopt Morrell's more imaginative plans. When the Mormons stalled the resulting US advance by doing the unexpected, General Leonard Wood protected the young officer by sending him to British Columbia to cut Canada's Pacific coast off from the interior. Morrell spent most of 1916 doing that, earning praise from observers Eduard Dietl of Austria-Hungary and Heinz Guderian of Germany. In the final year of the war Morrell's innovative use of barrels ensured the seizure of Nashville, and the subsequent rupture of Confederate lines. Soon, General Custer's and Morrell's doctrine of massed barrel attacks was in use along every eastern front in North America. When the war ended, Morrell was a Colonel, a national hero, and was given his choice of assignments. He decided to head Barrel Works in Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas, and initially made great strides in designing the next generation of barrels. While stationed in Leavenworth, Morrell met Agnes Hill, a widow who lost her husband early in the Great War. They married in 1921, and their daughter, Mildred, was born in 1925. The cost-cutting of Upton Sinclair's Socialist administration ensured that Barrel Works was closed down in 1923. His subsequent posting to Philadelphia lasted only two years, with his outspoken criticism of America's foreign policy resulting in a transfer to occupation duty in Kamloops, British Columbia. The next seven years proved largely uneventful, with Morrell handling a sullen but acquiescent region. He received a visit in 1926 from now-Lieutenant-Colonel Guderian, along with an unnamed German sergeant who had strong anti-semitic views. With the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1932, Morrell found himself back at Barrel Works, though he was soon transferred to occupation duty in Houston, his wife and daughter remained at Fort Leavenworth, as Morrell didn't want to risk their lives in the hostile state. With the plebiscite of 1940 came Houston's return to the CSA, and Morrell was assigned as barrel commander in Ohio under Brigadier General Abner Dowling, Custer's former adjutant. When Confederate Operation Blackbeard was launched on June 22, 1941 Morrell found himself in an unenviable position. Despite his best efforts, the prewar shortage of soldiers and barrels ensured that General George Patton's armor succeeded in reaching Sandusky on Lake Erie by late August. With the United States cut in half, Morrell found his attempts to throw the Confederates back frustrated not only by CS sabotage in eastern Ohio but the War Department's focus on northern Virginia. In January, 1942, Morrell was badly wounded by a Confederate would-be assassin, which ironically served to bring him to his own superiors' attention as to just how skilled and dangerous a commander the CSA viewed him to be. Upon recovery and a promotion to Brigadier General, he commanded the US forces in Ohio and Pennsylvania during Operation Coalscuttle. His victory at Pittsburgh in early 1943 was the beginning of the end for the CSA. Morrell planned an assault on Kentucky and Tennessee. Knowing that the Confederates were familiar with the details of the 1917 attack, he used deception to concentrate Confederate forces around Covington, but struck further west in a massive amphibious assault across the Ohio River in the summer of 1943. He drove past Bowling Green and moved into east Tennessee towards Chattanooga. In August, an airborne assault on Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge prevented Chattanooga from becoming a Confederate Pittsburgh. Morrell's troops then moved towards Atlanta, the industrial heart of the Confederacy. Morrell succeeded in taking Atlanta, and proceeded to head towards Savannah, cutting the Confederacy in two. This action was similar to Sherman's March to the Sea in the American Civil War. Morrell witnessed the superbomb attack on Philadelphia, during which drops of radioactive liquid came into contact with his skin, which he wisely chose to scrub off as quickly as possible. On July 14, 1944, Morrell arrived in Pineville, North Carolina to accept the surrender of the Confederate States from President Don Partridge. When the U.S. moved into the former Confederacy to occupy it, Morrell was made military governor of Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. As military governor, Morrell made it clear that any attempt to rebel against the United States would result in the use of force; in addition, any attempt to stir up mob action against returned black concentration camp survivors would also be met by force. Morrell supervised the production of a pamphlet, Equality, which stated the U.S. position of total legal equality between black and white ex-Confederates, including marriage if both parties wanted it. This pamphlet was produced throughout the former Confederacy. Asked to testify for the defense in the trial of Clarence Potter, Morrell magnanimously agreed, though it was Potter who tried to have Morrell assassinated in the early part of the war. Morrell's testimony, confirming the United States also used the \\"ruse of war\\" of having troops dressed in enemy uniform infiltrate behind the lines. It was probably Morrell's testimony which saves Potter's life and made it impossible for the court to sentence him to death for using the same \\"ruse\\" in the bombing of Philadelphia. There is a direct parallel between Irving Morrell and Erwin Rommel, as both fought in their respective First World War, and both started the Second World War as colonels and as leading proponents of armored warfare. This is acknowledged in the character's name: Irving is the Anglo version of Erwin, and Morrell is a near-anagram of Rommel. =Moss, Jonathan= (Viewpoint character, GW:AF-SA:ID) Jonathan Moss grew up in a well-to-do Chicago family, and enlisted as a U.S. fighter pilot out of college. Flying on the southern Ontario front in the Great War, Moss established a strong relationship with a Canadian farmer named Laura Secord. Moss studied law at Northwestern University near Chicago after the War, pining after Secord all the while, and moved to Berlin, Ontario in Occupied Canada to establish his career as an attorney in military occupation courts. He earned some fame as a defender of Canadians' rights, though Moss readily admitted this only meant he lost less often than most of his peers, as the legal system created by the occupiers was heavily weighted against the \\"Canucks\\". By patient wooing Moss eventually won the love of Laura Secord and married her. However, marrying an American, even a liberal one, made her a traitor in the eyes of Canadian nationalists, and she was suspected of having betrayed the rebellion of 1924. Fascinated by the new fighter planes which he sees, Moss persuades the authorities to let him take up part-time flying for the United States armed forces. This act, widely publicized in the press, acts as the final trigger causing Mary McGregor Pomeroy to send a package bomb which kills Moss' wife and daughter. Full of anger and bitterness, Moss turned his back upon Canada and rejoined the U.S. Army as a full-time fighter pilot. When World War II erupted he fought for approximately a year on the Ohio and Virginia fronts, was shot down over Virginia, and sent to Andersonville, Georgia as a POW. He escaped during a tornado along with Nick Cantarella, and the two joined a band of black guerrillas, led by Spartacus, fighting the Confederacy. Throughout 1942 and 1943, he and the black guerrilla band continued to wage operations against Confederate civilians and Mexican troops across rural Georgia. However, an attempt to steal a plane - with which Spartacus wanted Moss to strafe the Confederates from the air while Moss himself hoped to use it to return to the US Army positions - led the band into an ambush in which it was badly mauled. In 1944, Moss was rescued by advancing U.S. forces, and was able to return to flying near the end of the war. He finished the Second Great War with three kills, after having been an ace in the earlier Great War. Considered too old to be a fighter pilot anymore, he took up lawyering again, and was invited to Houston, Texas, part of a nominally restored independent republic, to defend concentration camp commandant Jefferson Davis Pinkard, because the man originally assigned to Pinkard's case was in bed with a broken leg. Although Moss made the best possible Sisyphean effort to defend the indefensible and save his client's life, Pinkard condemned himself by proudly and remorselessly bragging about his efficient \\"reduction of population,\\" and therefore was found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death. The judge and prosecutors were moved by Moss' steadfast fortitude in his thankless task, and offered him a place on the Judge Advocate's staff. Moss accepted, and took up helping the surviving Southern blacks as his new cause. =O'Doull, Leonard= (GW:WH-AE:VO, Viewpoint character AE:VO-SA:ID) Leonard O'Doull, M.D., was a surgeon who served in the U.S. Army on the Quebec front in the Great War at a military hospital in Rivi√®re-du-Loup. While stationed there, he met Nicole Galtier, the daughter of Lucien Galtier, upon whose land the hospital had been built. He married Nicole in 1917 and after the war he settled down to practice in Rivi√®re-du-Loup in the Republic of Quebec. The marriage produced one son, Lucien O'Doull, named for his maternal grandfather. In his time in Rivi√®re-du-Loup, O'Doull developed a fondness for the Qu√©b√©cois people and culture, and became very close to his wife's family, especially his father-in-law. His French, fluent to start with, developed from \\"Parisian\\" into the quite distinct Qu√©b√©cois dialect. When the Second Great War began, O'Doull was encouraged by US authorities to rejoin the US Army. Despite his having grown very comfortable in the Republic of Quebec, he found his loyalties remained with the nation of his birth and rejoined the Army's Medical Service, where he was given the rank of major. He was stationed on the Virginia front, where he befriended Granville McDougald, and was transferred to the city of Pittsburgh when it was invaded by the Confederates. After the decisive U.S. victory in Pittsburgh, O'Doull found himself as a front line surgeon in an army rapidly advancing through Kentucky and Tennessee. O'Doull remained with the Army through the end of the war, making lieutenant colonel, and the beginning of the occupation in Alabama; however, he was able to secure his discharge through the offices of the Qu√©b√©cois government and returned to private practice in Rivi√®re-du-Loup. =Pound, Michael= (AE:BI-SA:RE; Viewpoint character SA:DE-SA:ID) Michael Pound was a U.S. Army sergeant who had fought in the First Great War. During the Second Great War, he served under Colonel Irving Morrell's command. After Morrell's wounding in 1941, Pound was transferred to another unit. He was rash, loud, and outspoken towards senior officers, but an effective mentor to junior officers who served with him. He saw action in Ohio, despite having a tank shot out from under him, and in the Battle of Pittsburgh as gunner in a U.S. barrel. Because of Pound's experience in barrel development, he was proficient at judging distance, a trait he used to destroy many Confederate barrels that otherwise would have been out of range in Pittsburgh. He received a battlefield commission in 1943. As a lieutenant, Pound commanded a platoon of five barrels in the attacks through Kentucky and Tennessee. He used deception to seize a key bridge in Kentucky, enabling the U.S. advance to go faster than planned. Pound eventually took part in the charge into Alabama, where he was burned when his barrel was attacked. After recovery, he was sent to Tallahassee, Florida to take part in the U.S. occupation there, where he helped defuse boycotts of services imposed by Confederate businesses. Whatever his personality was before the war, Pound had become a bit psychopathic by the end of it, showing little remorse for any civilian casualties for which he was directly or indirectly responsible, and had no moral objections to the ever more brutal hostage policy of the US forces. During the postwar occupation, incoming US Vice President Harry Truman was shocked to hear Lt. Pound casually propose a strategy that sounded like the genocide of the CSA's white population. Truman vowed that he (Truman) would not become as bad as Jake Featherston. Pound figured that he (Pound) may very well have just killed his own chances for promotion, but did not care, because he loved his current job so much. =Quigley, Jedediah= (GW:AF-AE:BI, SA:RE, SA:ID) Lieutenant Colonel Jedediah Quigley, from New Hampshire, was the U.S. Army officer in charge of the military government of Rivi√®re-du-Loup, Quebec, during the Great War. He seized land from Luicien Galtier to build a military hospital in 1915; however, he agreed to pay back rent to the Galtiers when Galtier's attitude became more positive toward the U.S. After the Great War, he became the U.S. military representative to the Government of Quebec, which had become a republic separate from Canada. He returned to Quebec shortly after the outbreak of the 1941 War to persuade Leonard O'Doull to return to active duty as an Army doctor for U.S. forces fighting in Ohio. After the war, he appeared once more, in his seventies, to ask O'Doull to make a report on ways and means military medicine could be improved. =Reach, William= (GW:AF-GW:B) William \\"Bill\\" Reach was a reporter for the Washington Evening Star before the Great War. Before that, although it is not clear, he intimated that he was Nellie Semphroch's lover, maybe even her procurer, and perhaps the father of Edna Semphroch. He was in charge of the U.S. spy ring in Washington, D.C., to which Nellie Semphroch and Hal Jacobs reported. He was able to warn Jacobs and Semphroch of an artillery bombardment that killed Edna Semphroch's fianc√© in 1916. He was killed in self-defense by Nellie Semphroch when he attempted to rape her during the Confederate withdrawal from Washington in 1917. =Reisen, Yossel Jr.= (GW:WH-AE:BI, AE:VO-SA:G) Yossel Reisen Jr. is the nephew of Congresswoman Flora Blackford. He was born in 1915 during the Great War. Reisen never knew his father, who was killed in the war before he was born. By 1941, Reisen had been conscripted in the Army and served in the same regiment with Armstrong Grimes, taking part in fighting against the Mormon rebellion in Utah. =Semphroch, Edna (Grimes)= (GW:AF-AE:VO, SA:G) Edna Semphroch, along with her mother Nellie, ran a coffee shop in Washington, D.C., before, during, and after the Confederate occupation of the city from 1914 to 1917. She was unaware of her mother's activities as a U.S. spy, and in fact was ready to marry a Confederate officer, Lieutenant Nicholas H. Kincaid, when shellfire from a U.S. cannon hit the church on H Street where the wedding was to be held, killing him. Edna received the Order of Remembrance, Second Class, from President Theodore Roosevelt after the Great War for her \\"services to the U.S,\\" though Nellie believed that she had done nothing to deserve it. She married Merle Grimes, a government clerk, after the war to avoid any possible scandal. She gave birth to a son, Armstrong Grimes, and a daughter, Annie Grimes. =Semphroch, Nellie (Jacobs)= (HFR, Viewpoint character, GW:AF- AE:VO) Nellie Semphroch was born in the mid-1870s in Washington, D.C., and experienced the first Confederate bombardment of the city during the Second Mexican War. In 1881, German military observer Alfred von Schlieffen saw her walking along a road in Washington in between bombings and the subsequent evacuation of government personnel to Philadelphia. She apparently struggled as a young woman and supported herself as a prostitute, using the name \\"Little Nell.\\" By 1914, however, she had managed to purchase a small restaurant in Washington, and was greatly concerned to hide her shady past from everybody else in general and from her daughter Edna in particular. The restaurant became a popular place for Confederate officers to eat, and Nellie found herself involved gathering intelligence for a U.S. spy ring run by Hal Jacobs, a cobbler, who also gathered information on Confederate forces. Near the end of the war in 1917, she killed Bill Reach, a US spymaster, when he tried to rape her. It would always haunt her when Hal Jacobs talked of him. It was also intimated that Bill Reach may have been Edna's biological father. Because her restaurant had been popular with the Confederates, she was initially arrested as a collaborator when the U.S. reoccupied the city in 1917. However, charges were dismissed and President Theodore Roosevelt awarded her with the Order of Remembrance, First Class. After the Great War, Semphroch married Jacobs and continued to run her coffee shop, catering to both Washingtonians and Confederate businessmen who remembered her place affectionately. She did not reveal her role as a U.S. spy until the mid 1930s. She died in 1937 of blood poisoning, not long after attending Alfred Emanuel Smith's presidential inauguration, her dying words being a confession of Bill Reach's death, though it is not clear if anyone ever believed her. Confederate StatesBartlett, Reginald= (Viewpoint character, GW:AF-AE:CCH) Reggie Bartlett was a pharmacist's assistant in Richmond, Virginia, when the Great War began in 1914. Shortly after being fired for skipping work to see President Woodrow Wilson's declaration of war speech, he joined the Seventh Virginia Regiment of the Confederate Army, fast becoming a hardened veteran. He was captured by Chester Martin's unit but eventually escaped from captivity, together with submarine commander Ralph Briggs. He was severely wounded and captured again by U.S. forces and remained a prisoner of war hospital patient until the Armistice, there becoming friendly with Rehoboam, a black Confederate POW who might have been a former Marxist rebel. Returning to Richmond and the pharmacy business, Bartlett saw the rise of Jake Featherston's Freedom Party and actively opposed it, supporting instead the Radical Liberals. He was gunned down by Freedom Party stalwarts in 1925 after he had torn down their posters. =Brearley, Tom= (GW:AF-AE:BI) Lieutenant Tom Brearley was a Confederate States Navy officer and was Roger Kimball's XO of the submarine CSS Bonefish throughout the Great War. Kimball considered him a comrade and a superb officer, but he immensely disliked his soft political philosophy. On the day when Kimball torpedoed the USS Ericsson, just after the war between the USA and the CSA ended, Brearley was the only crew member of the Bonefish against Kimball's decision and thus refused to man his battle station to carry out the order. In return, Kimball threatened Brearley's life if he ever spoke of the war crime to anyone. After the war, Brearley drifted like other veterans and kept Kimball's secret. But when he becomes horrified by the rise of the fanatical Freedom Party aided by Kimball's involvement, he decides to break his silence. He tries to convince Kimball's lover, Anne Colleton, to withdraw her support for the Freedom Party by telling her about Kimball's actions, but she coldly refuses to due to her hatred of the United States and threatens him as well, but Brearley is undeterred. With help from Reggie Bartlett, Brearley goes to the press and tells his story anonymously. Though the secret is out, not many people in the Confederacy care due to the Freedom Party's popularity, at least until President Hampton V's assassination. Though published anonymously, Brearley's identify is figured out and he is killed when his house is burned down by Freedom Party stalwarts with Brearley trapped inside. His story reaches the United States and to Sylvia Enos, which allows her to finally learn the identity of the man who killed her husband, George Enos, who was aboard the Ericsson when it was sunk. When the US government does nothing to demand for Roger Kimball's extradition, she travels to South Carolina and kills him herself, finally exacting justice. =Butler, Clark= (SA:ID) Clark Butler is a throwaway gag character from near the end of the series. His name is an amalgam of Clark Gable and Rhett Butler of Gone With the Wind fame. A local official in Georgia who is willing to collaborate with the victorious \\"Yankees\\" following the disbanding of the CSA, Butler is nevertheless shocked to learn that the new conquerors will enforce a racial equality law. General Morrell responds to Butler's discomfort by saying \\"Frankly, Butler, I don't give a damn,\\" parodying the signature line of the eponymous Margaret Mitchell creation. =Calkins, Grady= (AE:BI) Grady Calkins was a Confederate veteran of the Great War, and member of the Birmingham, Alabama chapter of the Freedom Party. In 1922, he assassinated Confederate President Wade Hampton V. He was gunned down by the state militia after a brief shootout moments later. This act brought a temporary halt to the momentum the Freedom Party had built up throughout the 1920s, leaving the party in the political wilderness until the Great Depression and the 1933 election. =Carter, Jack= (SA:ID) Jack Carter, owner of the Tarkas estate, was a Richmond, Virginia gentleman who protected his Black house staff from Jake Featherston's Second Great War genocide, in an analog of Schindler's List. At war's end, United States General Abner Dowling summoned Carter to congratulate him and recruit him as a collaborator, but Carter coldly refused all praise and offers of friendship. He insisted that he, a dyed in the wool Whig, only did it for his personal convenience and his fondness for the good old days of the CSA. He hated Featherston for overthrowing the Whigs and wasting useful Blacks, but hated the Yankees more because they were foreigners. He is named for characters from Edgar Rice Burroughs's \\"Barsoom\\" series of novels: CSA Captain John Carter of Virginia and his friend the Martian chieftain Tars Tarkas. =Cassius= (GW:AF-GW:B) Cassius was the huntsman for the Marshlands Plantation in St. Matthews, South Carolina, owned by the Colleton family. He was also head of the Marxist underground in the area. When the Red Rebellion of 1915-16 broke out, Cassius became the leader of the Congaree Socialist Republic and was responsible for ordering the execution of many \\"enemies of the people,\\" both black and white. He escaped the crushing of the Republic in 1916 and with his female companion, Cherry, continued guerrilla operations against the CSA, and in particular against Anne Colleton. Cassius was killed by Anne's brother Tom shortly after the Armistice of 1917. =Colleton, Anne= Viewpoint character, (GW:AF-SA:RE) Anne Colleton, in 1914, was the owner of the Marshlands Plantation of St. Matthews, South Carolina, a supporter of the arts, including Marcel Duchamp, and a prominent political figure in the state. The Red rebellion of 1915 resulted in the loss of the mansion house at Marshlands, which was burned down by her chief hunter, Cassius, and the death of her brother, Jacob, who had been a soldier and was debilitated by mustard gas. This started a personal vendetta between Colleton, whose political influence could raise the state militia, and Cassius and his female partner, Cherry, which lasted until Cassius was killed by her brother Tom shortly after the Armistice of 1917. She was briefly involved in a romantic affair with Confederate Navy commander Roger Kimball during the Great War, but broke off the affair when Kimball became too involved in the Freedom Party. She was also intimately involved with Clarence Potter for a brief time, though their conflicting politics prevented them from establishing a long-term relationship. During the period between the Great Wars, Colleton became involved with the Freedom Party as a designer for mass-rallies, but stopped her support after a Freedom Party sniper killed Confederate President Wade Hampton V. However, as she realized that the Freedom Party was likely to win control of the nation, Colleton worked her way back into favor with Jake Featherston. Colleton was killed, shortly after listening to a speech by Congressman Strom Thurmond (F-S.C.) in a 1941 U.S. bombing raid on Charleston, South Carolina, in the early days of the Second Great War while in the city on Freedom Party business. =Colleton, Tom= (GW:AF-SA:RE, Viewpoint character SA:RE-SA:DE) Tom Colleton was the brother of Anne Colleton. He served as a Confederate infantry officer during the war of 1914-1917, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel, but left the army after the war ended. He, and his sister, using South Carolina militia, ended up hunting down the last remnants of the Congaree Socialist Republic, and he personally killed their leader Cassius. He was recalled to service in World War II, as a lieutenant colonel. He disliked the Freedom Party but nevertheless went out to fight in Jake Featherston's war, out of patriotism and hatred of the Yankees. Colleton's unit was involved in the invasion of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and was trapped in the Battle of Pittsburgh, where he was killed in late January 1943, just days before the Confederate pocket surrendered. =Dover, Jerry= (AE:CCH-SA:DE; Viewpoint character SA:G-SA:ID) Jerry Dover was a frontline Great War veteran and the manager of the Huntsman's Lodge in Augusta, Georgia and was Xerxes' (Scipio's) boss. He was known to protect his black workers from Freedom Party cleanouts by sheltering them and their families in the Lodge overnight. This was more out of personal liking for Scipio and other workers, and for the benefit of the Lodge, rather than from any revolutionary feeling of racial enlightenment on his part. Dover was righteously rude to anyone who stood in the way of his doing his job, and he let people know how he felt in richly profane language. Dover is first seen through Scipio's eyes, then becomes a viewpoint character in his own right. In 1942, Dover signed up for the Quartermaster Corps as a major, and was called to active duty later that year. Dover was known to work his men \\"like niggers\\" according to observers. When his commander went missing in 1943, Dover organized the supplies of the Confederate Army in Kentucky, falling back to Tennessee and Georgia. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel and also received the Purple Heart for injuries sustained during a U.S. bombing raid. Although married, Dover also had a female friend, who blackmailed him for money and military information. The fact that Dover reported the blackmail first and was good at his job saved him from being arrested by the Confederate intelligence. Dover was captured in Alabama and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner. At the end of the war, he was one of the first CSA officers to be released from prison, due to a good word from Cassius Madison (slayer of Jake Featherston), whose life had once been saved by Dover when the latter had allowed him to shelter overnight at the restaurant. Returning to Augusta, Dover resumed managing the Huntsman's Lodge, and had a brief encounter with the woman who had blackmailed him, and who turned out to be working for the Yankees, as he had suspected. =Dresser, Anthony= (AE:BI) Anthony Dresser founded the Freedom Party in Richmond, Virginia after the end of World War I in 1917. The party consisted only of a few people and was only able to get fliers across war-ravaged Richmond because one of its members was a printer. Jake Featherston became interested in the party and soon became one of its members. Anthony Dresser tried giving a speech at a campaign for the Confederate Congress and was nearly laughed off the stage until Featherston stepped up. Featherston began blaming the blacks and war department for the CSA's loss in the war, and struck a chord with many Confederates. Featherston began a speaking tour to raise support for the party, and soon became the Freedom Party's Head of Propaganda. With this new- found support for Featherston, Dresser became afraid for his position in the party and tried to have Featherston removed, stating Featherston had turned the party's message into one saying \\"Hang the generals and hang the niggers\\" and was giving people the wrong idea about the party. Though Dresser found some support amongst the rank-and-file Party members, Featherston pointed out that he raised more than half of the party's funding and without him, the party would go back to being nothing. The motion to remove Featherston failed, and Featherston himself raised the motion to remove Dresser. The motion was carried out by a landslide and Featherston became head of the Freedom Party, while Dresser faded into obscurity. Dresser is an analog to Anton Drexler, the founder of the Nazi Party which was then hijacked by Adolf Hitler. =Featherston, Jake= (Viewpoint character, GW:AF-SA:ID) =FitzBelmont, Henderson V.= (SA:RE-SA:ID) Professor Henderson V. FitzBelmont was a physicist at Washington University in Lexington, Virginia. In 1941, he attempted to convince President Jake Featherston to provide him with funding to begin work on an atomic bomb project. Featherston denied this request, and it wasn't until the next year when Confederate intelligence found that the United States were working on their own uranium enrichment project. Shortly after finding this out, Featherston gave permission to FitzBelmont to begin work on his project. Partly because of Featherston's initial refusal, the U.S. nuclear program had a clear advantage over the Confederate one, a fact that was made clear by FitzBelmont after his second meeting with the President. Nevertheless, due to FitzBelmont's brilliance and dedication, he and his team managed to produce a nuclear \\"superbomb\\" under constant heavy bombing by the US Air Force, and were able against all odds to be the first on the North American continent to produce a nuclear superbomb which was exploded at the outskirts of Philadelphia, with gruesome results. However, before they could produce a second one the Confederacy collapsed and Lexington was captured by the US Army. After being thoroughly interrogated, FitzBelmont hoped to be allowed to resume his academic career - telling his American captors that he was no longer a danger to them, since building a bomb was dependent on the resources of major power which the defunct Confederacy would no longer put at his disposal. However, the Americans considered him a dangerous \\"bomb\\" in himself, since he could have been captured by a rival power seeking nuclear arms, placing his knowledge and ability at such a power's disposal. For this reason, General John Abell says that FitzBelmont, and certain other Confederates, may have to be liquidated in staged automobile accidents, but no results of this plan are ever revealed, leaving FitzBelmont's ultimate fate to the reader's imagination. Analogous to Robert Oppenheimer =Goldman, Saul= (AE:CCH-SA:ID) Saul Goldman is a high-ranking member of the Freedom Party. Goldman was the director of the first radio network in Richmond, Virginia in the 1920s when Jake Featherston of the Freedom Party found him. Being the first politician to recognize radio's full potential, the Freedom Party leader uses Goldman's studio to broadcast speeches to the people of the Confederate States. Goldman isn't turned away by the repulsive nature of the Freedom Party; rather, he is glad the Party goes after blacks and not Jews, the way the Russians did in Poland. In 1933, Featherston is elected Confederate President, and he gives Goldman the post of Director of Communications (the head of the Freedom Party's propaganda). Goldman consolidates the media networks and publishing companies of the CSA into one ministry under the Freedom Party's direction, and imposes near-totalitarian control over what the Confederate people read and hear. While doing all this, Goldman remains a quiet, shy man, never becoming the balls-and-fists type of stalwart that the Freedom Party attracts in droves. Featherston gives him credit for being the one man in the Party that \\"had more brains than balls.\\" In 1944, Goldman flees Richmond with Featherston and other important Confederate officials, but is captured after Featherston is killed. Along with Ferdinand Koenig, Goldman is tried by the U.S. for crimes against humanity and hanged - it being judged that systematically instilling racist hatred of blacks in the Confederacy's population makes him a full accomplice in the Black Holocaust, even though he was not directly involved in the killings themselves. Goldman is analogous to Joseph Goebbels and is possibly modeled after Samuel Goldwyn as well, with an obvious irony that an alternate Nazi analog is Jewish. =Hampton, Wade V= (AE:BI) Wade Hampton V is a fictional descendant of Wade Hampton III and a prominent member of the Whigs. In 1921, Hampton V ran for President of the CSA and won election over both Jake Featherston (Freedom) and Ainsworth Layne (Radical Liberals). His presidency came to a premature end in June 1922 when he was assassinated by Freedom Party member Grady Calkins at a Birmingham, Alabama, rally. Hampton became the first president in the history of either the Confederate States or United States to be assassinated. His vice-president Burton Mitchel III was sworn in as president afterwards to finish the remainder of his six-year term. His assassination shares many similarities with the historical Beer Hall Putsch. =Kimball, Roger= (GW:AF, Viewpoint character, GW:WH-AE:BI) Lieutenant Commander Roger Kimball was a submarine commander in the Confederate States Navy during the Great War. He received a Confederate Navy Cross for sinking two US gunships during a raid in a Chesapeake Bay harbor. He later was given a promotion to Commander after another raid into New York harbor which ended with the sinking of two US Battleships. He resumed command of a submarine until receiving news of the Armistice in 1917, upon which he knowingly torpedoed the USS Ericsson after hostilities ended, killing, among others, Seaman George Enos. Kimball was romantically involved with Anne Colleton in 1915. They resumed their relationship after the War, when both were involved in the Freedom Party's rise; however, Colleton broke off the relationship when the Party lost prestige following the assassination of Confederate President Wade Hampton V by a Freedom Party member. Shortly after their breakup, Kimball was shot and killed in 1923 by Sylvia Enos, widow of George Enos. =Kincaid, Nicholas= (GW:AF-GW:B) Nicholas H. Kincaid was a lieutenant in the Confederate Army during the Great War. He was stationed in Washington, DC.. He became romantically and sexually involved with Edna Semphroch (despite her mother's best efforts). The two were engaged to be married, but their wedding was interrupted when the United States Army began its campaign to retake the city in 1917. Kincaid was killed in the opening bombardment by being decapitated by a gun shell. =Knight, Willy= (AE:BI-SA:RE) Willy Knight was the first Vice-President of Jake Featherston's Confederate government. He was the head of Texas-based Redemption League, which held similar goals to the Freedom Party, and was then absorbed into it. Towards the crucial 1933 elections, Featherston decided to take Knight as his running mate so as to unite the White racist, anti-establishment vote. This aroused the anger of Ferdinand Koenig, Featherston's faithful lieutenant, leading to their only serious quarrel. Featherston, however, managed to convince Koenig that he was setting a trap for Knight, fobbing him off with a meaningless title, while Koening as \\"Attorney General\\" would create and head a fearsome secret police. It took some years for Knight to understand the situation in which he was trapped, the full reality hitting him when Featherston got the Confederate Constitution amended so as to allow Presidents to serve a second term in office. This precipitated Knight's failed coup d'etat in 1939, after which Knight was imprisoned in Louisiana's Camp Dependable, run by Jefferson Pinkard - being placed as the only White prisoner among hundreds of Black rebels. Presumably, Ferdinand Koenig and Featherston assumed that they could neatly get rid of Knight by putting him at the mercy of militant Blacks who hated Whites in general, and senior Freedom Party officials in particular. However, rather than being killed by his Black fellow-inmates, Knight won their grudging respect. After a long period in which Pinkard repeatedly reported to Richmond that Knight was still alive, and that the Blacks were showing no inclination to kill him, in 1941 Koening at last ordered Knight summarily executed, an order which Pinkard duly implemented. His name may be derived from the Willys- Knight automobile. The internal struggle in the Freedom Party has rough historic parallels with the R√∂hm-Putsch. =Koenig, Ferdinand= (AE:BI-SA:ID) Ferdinand Koenig is a high-ranking member of the Freedom Party and the CSA's Attorney General. His character appears to have been inspired by both Heinrich Himmler and Hermann G√∂ring. It is interesting that he is one of the few Confederates in this series with a German name, as the Germans are theoretically \\"good guys\\" (allied with the USA), and the Nazis never exist. The name Koenig means King. Koenig began his career as Party secretary, where he was found by Jake Featherston and molded into his staunchest supporter. Twice he ran on the Freedom ticket as vice president, but allowed the spot to go to Willy Knight in 1933. Instead Featherston made Koenig attorney general of the Confederate States. Once in office, Koenig searched for ways to disband the Supreme Court and increase Featherston's power by arresting and executing members of the opposition parties. As the 1940s dawned, Featherston decided that the time had come to begin \\"population reductions\\" (i.e.: killing off the Confederacy's blacks). Koenig was tasked with overseeing this program, for which he ordered a number of camps established in Louisiana. Shipments of Negroes commenced in 1940, composed of men from Confederate jails or those arrested at roadblocks in the towns. Before long places such as Camp Dependable, outside of Alexandria, Louisiana, were filled to overflowing. Shortly before the outbreak of War in 1941, Koenig phoned Camp Dependable's commandant, Jefferson Pinkard, with the news that 2000 more blacks would arriving, along with an unspoken order to ensure there was sufficient room for them. Other camps received similar instructions, resulting in the first massacres. In early 1942, Koenig upped the ante. Entire portions of black districts in towns would be cleared out over the course of a single night. Even as the situation of the war grew obviously worse, Koenig rarely wavered in his belief that Confederates will win the war as Featherston promised. Evidently, his blind devotion to Featherston and his cause prevented him from making rational decisions in the better interest of the nation. Under Featherston's orders, he diverted badly needed resources from the war effort into the extermination program, which he believed takes priority to winning the conflict. He authorized the building of Camp Humble when Camp Determination was overrun by U.S. troops. In 1944, Koenig fled Richmond with Featherston and other important Confederate officials, but was captured after Featherston was killed. Koenig was among the Confederate officials put on trial for crimes against humanity. Found guilty, he was hanged together with Saul Goldman. =Layne, Ainsworth= (AE:BI) Ainsworth Layne was the Radical Liberal Party candidate for the President of the Confederate States in the 1921 election. While he was defeated by Whig Party candidate Wade Hampton V, the final polling suggested that his loss was at least in part because of the candidacy of Freedom Party candidate Jake Featherston. Layne was earnest in his desire to reconcile with both the United States and with the colored residents of the CSA, unpopular positions immediately after the Great War. During the campaign, Featherston made much of the fact that Layne was Harvard- educated, and during one speech, accused Layne of wanting to bring the Confederacy back into the United States. Like the Whigs, Layne and the rest of the members of the Radical Liberal Party were often subjected to violence by the Freedom Party. During a speech in Charleston, South Carolina, Layne's supporters were set upon by Freedom Party Stalwarts led by Roger Kimball. Shots were fired, and Kimball had to prevent a Stalwart from shooting Layne. =Longstreet, Samuel= (AE:CCH) Samuel Longstreet was a Whig Senator from Virginia. The grandson of former general and President James Longstreet, Samuel himself was the Whig nominee for the presidency in 1933. He and his running-mate Hugo Black were defeated by the Freedom Party's Jake Featherston. This defeat made Longstreet the first Whig candidate to lose a Presidential election in Confederate history. =Madison, Cassius= (AE:CCH-SA:DE; Viewpoint character SA:G-SA:ID) Named for the late huntsman at the Marshlands Plantation, Cassius is the son of Scipio (also called Xerxes) and Bathsheba, and brother of Antoinette. As he grew up in Augusta, Georgia's Terry district, he developed a sense to strike back at the white \\"ofays\\" who oppressed him and his family. In early 1943, Cassius told his father that he would not be attending church one Sunday, which meant that he escaped a cleanout of the Terry which took his father, mother, and sister to Camp Determination in Texas and their eventual deaths. For a time after leaving the Terry, Cassius looked for whatever work he could find, eventually joining a resistance group led by Gracchus. After US forces occupied the part of Georgia he was operating in, Cassius became an auxiliary for the US Army in Madison, Georgia. While serving in this capacity in 1944, he came across Jake Featherston and other top Freedom officials walking down a road from Athens after their plane was shot down. Cassius shot Featherston several times, killing the President of the Confederate States and making sure the tyrant was dead, and taking the rest of the group prisoner. He became famous, given a cash reward and became a U.S. citizen, taking the last name of Madison after the town where he shot and killed Featherston. He attended the inauguration of US President Thomas E. Dewey on February 1, 1945 as a special guest. There may be symbolism in his name, as Gaius Cassius Longinus, often known simply as Cassius, was one of the assassins of another larger-than-life head of state, Julius Caesar. =Mattox, Lulu= (AE:BI-SA:ID) Lulu Mattox is the personal secretary of Jake Featherston. She was hired by the Freedom party in the early 1920s to work for Featherston, though the Freedom Party leader had shown no interest in hiring a secretary. In later years, however, Featherston would credit Mattox for the Party's survival, especially after the anti-Freedom backlash resulting from the assassination of Confederate President Wade Hampton V, and was one of the few people whose feelings mattered to Featherston. Mattox presented herself as an obstacle to people who wished to meet with Featherston, especially those who weren't close associates with him. During Featherston's presidency she took care of her boss, making sure he ate and got enough sleep between meetings and events. That helped endear her to Jake Featherston. In 1944, she fled Virginia and North Carolina with her boss and several other Freedom Party officials. Attempting to flee South Carolina by plane, she was badly wounded when the group was shot down. She pleaded with Jake Featherston to shoot her before he makes his getaway, as she did not want to be taken by US forces and live the rest of her life in a world without Featherston. With great reluctance, her boss carried out her last wish, shooting her dead with his Colt .45. The character has some characteristics in common with Eva Braun (although there is no sexual relationship with the boss in this case), and her name recalls controversial Georgia politician Lester Maddox. =Mitchel, Burton= (AE:BI-AE:CCH) Burton Mitchel was Vice President of the CSA when Wade Hampton V was assassinated at a rally in 1922, only three months after his inauguration. Upon taking office, Mitchel asked U.S. President Upton Sinclair to repeal the reparations payments that had severely damaged the Confederate economy. In 1927, the C.S. Supreme Court ruled that Mitchel was eligible to run for a full six-year term, despite his serving more than five years of Hampton's term. He won the election (erroneously reported as having won re-election), but was burdened by the economic collapse in 1929, which left many Confederate citizens homeless; as a result, many people set up in \\"Mitcheltowns\\" across the CSA (these were called \\"Blackfordburghs\\" in the United States; both were analogs to Hoovervilles). He left office in 1934 as the Freedom Party's control over the CSA began. Michel is likely meant to be a fictional descendant of Charles B. Mitchel, who served in the U.S. and C.S. Senates in the 1860s. =Partridge, Donald= (AE:VO-SA:ID) Donald Partridge was the Freedom Party's replacement for the slot of the vice-presidency after Willy Knight's attempted coup. He was chosen because Jake Featherston reckoned him a useless, harmless idiot, unlike the ambitious Knight. Partridge spent his time in the vice-presidency thinking of dumb farm-girl jokes to tell Featherston, or in the company of various ladies in hotels here and there, according to secret Freedom Party guard reports. He also spent most of his time promoting the war effort, traveling from city to city across the CSA making speeches and imploring the Confederates to fight on. After Featherston's death in 1944, Partridge became the 14th and last president of the CSA, with his presidency lasting only a week. He unconditionally surrendered to US forces, and as a result, the CSA was disbanded as a nation. Afterward, Partridge was taken prisoner by Morrell, but presumably was released after a short time, as he had only been a figurehead who did not take part in the genocide. Partridge is a caricature of Dan Quayle, as seen with their similar names (cv. Quail and Partridge) and the image of Quayle in popular culture as a clueless buffoon. =Pinkard, Jefferson Davis= (Viewpoint character, GW:AF-SA:ID) An Alabama native, Jefferson Pinkard is a steelworker at the Sloss Works in Birmingham when the Great War breaks out. Pinkard as originally introduced to the reader - before being traumatized by the combination of war and personal crisis - is a highly sympathetic character. To begin with, he is not a racist, fully willing to accept a black co-worker and accord him the respect due to a skillful steel man in a dangerous and demanding job. (Even Jake Featherston, who would later develop into a Hitler-like racist, does not initially display a noticeably higher level of anti-black racism than other Confederate characters). The war affects Pinkard more fundamentally - and negatively - than many other characters in the series. Conscripted into the Confederate Army late in 1915, he and his friend, Sonoran recruit Hipolito Rodriguez, receive their baptism by fire when they go into combat against the \\"Red\\" rebels. Home on leave in 1917, he catches his wife Emily performing fellatio on his best friend and next-door neighbor, Bedford Cunningham, a crippled veteran. That, combined with the Confederacy's defeat that year, leaves him a bitter and vengeful man. Although his wife betrayed him with a white man, in his mind the deep sense of personal betrayal by her seems to blend with the widespread feeling in the surrounding society that the Confederacy had been \\"betrayed\\" by the black rebels who \\"stabbed it in the back\\" and caused its defeat. During the postwar years he finds solace in the Freedom Party, becoming a regular attendee at Birmingham chapter meetings and joining other Freedom Party stalwarts in disrupting their opponents' rallies. At his steel works job he shocks the black fellow-worker with whom he was previously friendly by hurling the Freedom Party greeting at him - a watershed moment where Pinkard starts down an ominous road. Devotion to the party would pay dividends in later years, but costs him his marriage: though he tries to forget his wife's adultery, his increasing distance leads to her being unfaithful once more. Catching Emily in the act, Pinkard throws her out into the street. Between the divorce and the Freedom Party's decline after Wade Hampton V's assassination, Pinkard decides to fight for the Imperialist side in the Mexican Civil War (similar to our timeline's Spanish Civil War.) Pinkard's stint in Mexico turns out to be a blessing to his personal fortunes. He finds himself almost by accident running a prisoner of war camp, an experience which proves to be a turning point in his life. In this initial venture into the business of guarding prisoners, Pinkard actually tries to be humane, being appalled by the cruelty of the Imperialists to their captives. This proves, however, a step down a slippery slope which is described in detail from book to book in the series. After the Business Collapse, Pinkard, who had resumed his job at the Sloss Works, is laid off. The Freedom Party quickly sets him up with a new occupation as a prison guard, and when the first camps for political prisoners are set up, Pinkard is offered a job as an assistant camp commandant at a Mississippi facility, and subsequently the head commandant at Louisiana's \\"Camp Dependable\\". Pinkard at first is in charge of detaining white political prisoners, especially the followers of Louisiana governor Huey Long, who is assassinated by Featherston's men. After Vice President Willy Knight attempts to assassinate Featherston, Knight becomes Pinkard's most notable prisoner. Soon many suspected black rebels are imprisoned as well. Gradually, a shift is made from detaining black rebels, or those suspected of being such, to detaining blacks solely on the basis of their race. More and more blacks are sent to the camp, and the government fails to supply food rations to feed them all. When Pinkard complains, he gets a phone call directly from Ferdinand Koenig (who under the innocuous title of \\"Attorney General,\\" heads the analog of the S.S.), who informs him that no extra food is forthcoming, and hints that a solution is available - \\"reducing the population\\" by taking black prisoners to deserted areas and having firing squads shoot them. That is the final watershed, which once crossed makes Pinkard a mass murderer. Soon, he is not only obeying orders (and soon loses any sense of remorse), but gives much \\"creative thought\\" to the improvement of the killing methods. The executions, where the killers must look their victims in the face, are too much for many guards (which is what happened in the actual early Nazi killings, as noted in the minutes of the Wannsee Conference). A guard named Leroy \\"Chick\\" Blades kills himself by venting carbon monoxide into his car, giving Pinkard the idea to put the disposable prisoners in trucks (telling them that they are being relocated to another prison) and gas them while simply driving to the burial sites, avoiding the need for the killer to actually witness what he is perpetrating. This is used to great effect, leading to his promotion to Brigade Leader (equivalent to a brigadier general in the army.) Pinkard is eventually ordered to have Willy Knight shot, which he does. He marries Edith Blades (Chick Blades' widow) and moves to a camp being built to his specifications near Snyder, Texas: Camp Determination, this timeline's analog of Auschwitz. When Pinkard comes up with an even more efficient way to \\"reduce the population\\", i.e. gas chambers disguised as bath houses, he is promoted to the rank of Group Leader (equivalent to a major general in the army.) Unlike at Auschwitz, the camp's victims are not cremated but buried in mass graves dug by bulldozers in the Texas Panhandle prairie. This becomes of crucial importance when it becomes clear that U.S. forces are closing in to capture Camp Determination. Pinkard arranges to destroy as much evidence as possible, including blowing up the gas chambers and destroying records. However, he does not succeed in hiding the mass graves, which are found by the U.S. Army, exhumed and presented to the whole world. Pinkard, however, succeeds in moving the killing operation and setting up Camp Humble in east Texas, near the town of the same name, with the killing facilities further \\"improved\\" with the addition of crematoria. However, these prove to be poorly designed, and the mayor of Humble, originally enthusiastic about the presence of the camp (because of the economic opportunities it provides and the \\"population reduction\\" going on there), later bitterly complains about the townspeople smelling the fumes from the malfunctioning crematoriums and seeing the bits of incompletely burned corpses floating down onto the town. The last year of the war proves disastrous for Pinkard, despite the birth of his son Raymond. In 1944, the state of Texas secedes from the Confederacy, declaring itself an independent republic, and surrenders to the United States. One of the terms of surrender is the arrest of all persons involved in the death camps. Pinkard's wife has just given birth to Raymond, and he is unwilling to leave them. The camp commandant is soon taken into custody by the U.S. Army. He is placed on trial, where, despite the best Sisyphean efforts of his defense attorney, Jonathan Moss, Pinkard condemns himself by proudly and remorselessly bragging about his efficiency in \\"taking care\\" of the Black \\"problem,\\" and is found guilty of crimes against humanity for his role in the slaughter of the black population of the Confederate States. In early 1945, Pinkard is executed by hanging. Pinkard has many parallels with Rudolf Lang, the protagonist of Death Is My Trade by the French author Robert Merle, who in turn is derived from Auschwitz commander Rudolf H√∂ss. =Potter, Clarence= (GW:AF-AE:BI, Viewpoint character AE:CCH-SA:ID) Clarence Potter, along with Tom Colleton, is an analogue of the Wehrmacht officers who despised Hitler but faithfully served Germany. Potter in particular appears to be based on Wilhelm Canaris, but his role in the failed attempt on Jake Featherston's life bears striking resemblances to Erwin Rommel's role in the July 20 Plot. Potter was from Richmond, Virginia, and seems to have come from a middle-class background. Before the Great War, he attended Yale, leaving him with a permanent half- Yankee accent that sometimes earned him suspicious looks from other Confederates. Potter's time there also gave him a greater understanding of the United States than most of his compatriots. During the Great War Potter was a CS Army major assigned to Army of Northern Virginia intelligence. It was in 1915 that his path first crossed with that of Jake Featherston, an artillery sergeant. When attempting to dig out Marxist Negro cells within the army, Featherston mentioned his suspicions about his commanding officer's body servant Pompey. That CO was Jeb Stuart III, son of General Jeb Stuart, Jr., a mighty power in Richmond and the man who quashed the investigation. Unfortunately for all involved, Pompey was revealed to be a leader in the Red Rebellion of 1915-16. Disgraced, Jeb III threw his life away in combat and neither Potter nor Featherston ever saw a promotion for the rest of the war. The latter turned into a bitter, vengeful man; Potter was the only officer he had any respect for, though not that much. The two men both hung tight while the rest of the Army of Northern Virginia fell to pieces during the summer of 1917, and shared a whiskey when the cease-fire went into effect. Their uneasy relationship fell apart after the war. Featherston moved to Richmond and began his rise within the Freedom Party. Potter, discharged from the army, made his living as a private detective while becoming increasingly involved in Whig Party activities. During the postwar years he and ex-submariner Roger Kimball attempted to get hold of Featherston once the former sergeant became a public figure. His half-hearted intentions of influencing Featherston were dashed when the Freedom Party leader sent a dismissive telegram in reply. Kimball became one of Featherston's right-hand men until his death in 1923; Potter sought to contain the damage by working with the Whigs, including briefly with Anne Colleton. He had little success, as his fellow party members remained mired in anachronistic thinking and procedures. After Featherston became president in 1934, Potter believed that it was only a matter of time before he found himself in a camp for political prisoners. Instead, he resolved to rid the Confederacy of what he was convinced was a leader who would bring ruin upon his country. Potter traveled to Richmond for the 1936 Olympics and took a seat in the swimming stadium, intending to kill Featherston. Fate intervened when a black frankfurter seller with the same idea pulled out a submachine gun and sprayed bullets around so recklessly Potter had to shoot him in self- defense. With Potter an overnight hero, Featherston (having his own suspicions about Potter's true intentions that day) decided that rather than dispose of him, the former Whig would be a greater asset elsewhere. Despite his aversion for the Freedom Party, Potter's patriotic sentiments won out, and he duly accepted a colonel's commission and a posting to Intelligence. An outsider in Confederate Intelligence (being neither part of the old guard nor a fanatical Freedom Party supporter), Potter nonetheless distinguished himself in the years before the 1941 War. He was the first to seriously consider not just what Confederate agents could do to the US but also the havoc that Yankee spies could wring within the Confederacy. When Featherston read Potter's conclusions, he promoted his old enemy to Brigadier General and allowed Potter to manage operations against the US. Prior to Operation Blackbeard in June 1941, Potter and his agents were instrumental in keeping the US off-guard while ascertaining American strength and doctrine. Though Featherston acted too rashly for Potter's comfort (he was convinced that had his advice been acted on the invasion would have been a strategic as well as tactical surprise), Potter's competent organization of pro-Confederate saboteurs helped George Patton's army reach Lake Erie by August. Further sabotage prevented the American barrel commander Irving Morrell from doing any serious damage to the Confederate corridor for the rest of the year. After Operation Blackbeard's initial success, Potter concentrated upon ferreting out spies within the Confederacy and keeping Generals Nathan Bedford Forrest III and Patton apprised of US movements in northern Virginia. After the disastrous Confederate defeat at Pittsburgh, Potter joins with General Forrest and other Confederate officers in a possible plot to overthrow Jake Featherston. This plot did not come to pass in 1943. The Richmond ghetto rebelled in April, forcing Potter and other staff officers to take part in its suppression. Following that, Potter oversaw an attempt to knock out the U.S. nuclear program at Hanford, Washington. This failed. Because of the need for manpower in the summer of 1943, he was given command of a brigade under General Patton's army. There, Potter infuriated the Confederate commander in much the same way he infuriated President Featherston: by telling the truth as he saw it. Potter was present at the U.S. airborne assault on Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain in August 1943, and was relieved of his command later that year. At this time Potter decided to abandon his involvement in the plot against Featherston, judging that the US would not budge from their demand for \\"unconditional surrender\\", whoever headed the Confederacy, and that the charismatic Featherston ‚Äî however much Potter despised him ‚Äî was the only leader capable of continuing the war and possibly snatching victory from the jaws of the impending defeat. The defection of Potter, with his skill at undercover operations, doomed the far more inept conspirators under Nathan Bedford Forrest III to failure and slow death by torture. Potter was placed in charge of sneaking a Confederate superbomb into the U.S. He did this by disguising a C.S. truck in U.S. colors and insignia, and he even wore a U.S. uniform. The superbomb was set off in Philadelphia, causing horrific bloodshed by the direct explosion and indirect effect of radioactivity. Afterwards, Potter was able to escape back to the C.S. Subsequently, he fled Virginia with Featherston and other Confederate officials, and was with them when a plane carrying them crashed in Georgia. This band of high-ranking castaways wandered too close to a US encampment, resulting in Featherston's death at the hands of a teenage sentry named Cassius, and the capture of the others. Potter was arrested and charged with violating the laws on war stemming from use of U.S. uniforms during his superbomb attack on Philadelphia. However, Irving Morrel ‚Äî whose assassination Potter had tried to arrange in earlier stages of the war, and who reaped the glory of being the USA's chief savior ‚Äî showed magnanimity by appearing as a defense witness at Potter's court-martial and stating clearly that the U.S. had done the same by using U.S. soldiers in Confederate uniforms to launch attacks. Thanks mainly to Morrel, Potter was found not guilty and released. He settled in Richmond (with the assistance of the U.S. government, which wanted to keep him under surveillance). Upon his release, Potter began writing his memoirs, entitled How I Blew Up Philadelphia. After having resettled in Richmond, Potter encounters an embittered young soldier whose words are similar to those of Jake Featherston's in the aftermath of the Great War. Potter decides to act this time, and advises the man to abandon his hatred and get on with his life. =Quinn, Robert= (AE:CCH-SA:RE, SA:G-SA:ID) Robert Quinn was a Freedom Party organizer in Baroyeca, Sonora. Though a white English-speaker, Quinn spoke Spanish fluently and was sensitive to the Hispanic culture of Baroyeca. He was also successful as an advocate for public works projects in the region. The combination of these two factors made Quinn an effective recruiter, and the Freedom Party became Baroyeca's dominant political organization during his time there, easily toppling the Radical Liberal organizations that dominated politics there and whose power was based on the traditional political patronage wielded by the rich land owners, against which Quinn mobilized a grassroots movement of poorer peasants. One native of Baroyeca who found Quinn's advocacy of the Freedom Party convincing was farmer and Great War veteran Hipolito Rodriguez. During the Second Great War, Quinn convinced Rodriguez to join the Freedom Party Guards and ultimately to take part in the Black Holocaust at Camp Determination, an assignment which later caused Rodriguez to commit suicide. In 1943, Quinn left Baroyeca and joined the Confederate Army, a clear sign that the C.S. Army was beginning to grow shorthanded given his age and status in the Freedom organization. He returned to Sonora after the war was over and began talking of starting an uprising against the U.S. occupation. He was prevented from doing so by Jorge Rodriguez (son of Hipolito), who wrote an anonymous letter to U.S. authorities detailing Quinn's Freedom Party connections. Jorge Rodriguez thought that resistance against the US was bound to fail. Quinn was subsequently arrested for his connections. =Ramsay, Stephen= (Viewpoint character GW:AF) Stephen Ramsay was a cavalry corporal in the Confederate Army serving in Sequoyah at the beginning of the Great War. He was part of a raid into Kansas in August 1914 to concentrate on railroad sabotage. Ramsay was next assigned to the Creek Nation Army of the Five Civilized Tribes as an officer/advisor, attaining the rank of captain in the army by 1915. Though Ramsay's army managed to hold off a U.S. advance, falling back towards Okmulgee in the process, the Creeks ordered the army to try to retake all U.S. positions in Sequoyah later in the year. After his commanding officer Hiram Lincoln was killed, Ramsay took command of the offensive, but only for a very brief time; he was killed by machine-gun fire while charging a United States trench only minutes after Lincoln's death. The fact Ramsay is only in the book for a short time, and has no 'follow on' character to take up his viewpoint slot, indicates that Turtledove created him simply to demonstrate how cavalry and old fashioned tactics and soldiers had no place in modern war. Ramsay is initially introduced (at least in the Audiobook) as \\"Colonel Ramsay\\". =Rodriguez, Hipolito= (GW:WH-GW:B, Viewpoint character AE:CCH-SA:G) Hipolito Rodriguez was a farmer from Baroyeca, Sonora, which was part of the Confederate States since 1881. His first combat action was against Negro rebels in South Carolina in 1915, after which Rodriguez served with Jefferson Pinkard on the West Texas front of the Great War. Upon demobilization, he returned to his farm in the far western CSA. In the 1920s, upon meeting Robert Quinn, a Freedom Party organizer, Rodriguez joined the Freedom Party and became a strong supporter, including taking part in actions against Radical Liberal landowners who discouraged voting for Jake Featherston and who hitherto dominated the formerly-Mexican parts of the Confederacy. This amounted to a kind of social revolution by the poorer peasants, roughly equivalent to our history's Mexican Revolution though here manipulated by the Freedom party for its own ends. He was among those who rallied in support of Featherston's continued presidency in 1939 (supporting the overturning of the law that limited a Confederate President to one six-year term), and enrolled his sons in the Hitler Youth-like Freedom Youth Corps; when the war began, they would go into the CS Army. The loyalty of Rodriguez and other Hispanic stalwarts seems amply rewarded when Featherstone's party embarks on fast modernization and development of the backward Spanish-speaking states, especially manifested in connecting all houses to electricity - a hitherto undreamed-of luxury for the Sonoran peasantry. This is not without its own dangers, however, and Rodriguez is electrocuted nearly to death by his carelessness with his new Frigidaire. Despite the lingering, debilitating effects of Rodriguez's electrocution, Quinn convinced him to join the Confederate Veterans' Brigades, a Freedom Party paramilitary organization. After training, Rodriguez was sent to Camp Determination, where he was reunited with Jeff Pinkard, his friend from the Great War. Up to that point, Rodriguez was depicted as a sympathetic and fairly decent character. While he takes at face value the party's anti-Black demagoguery (and like Saul Goldman, figures pragmatically that it is better for him and his that this hatred is not directed at Hispanic \\"greasers\\") this had hitherto no direct implications as there were no actual Blacks living anywhere near his home. This abruptly changes with his becoming a guard in the extermination camp, accepting the role after an initial shock at first witnessing the killing of Blacks, and soon actively participating in the killing and even taking various grisly initiatives. In this he goes much faster down the road of his friend Pinkard, who also started out as a fairly decent person and took decades to become a ruthless mass killer. Some of the camp's white guards looked down on Rodriguez because of his race and his personal connection to the commandant. But his chance remark concerning the use of poison to remove pests from the guards' quarters led Pinkard to think up the idea of gas chambers to kill the camp's prisoners en masse. This action led to Rodriguez' promotion to Troop Leader (the Freedom Party Guards' equivalent to sergeant). Despite little outward evidence of his faith, Rodriguez thought of himself as a very religious man. At first, he was able to reconcile his duty and his faith by not viewing the prisoners as human beings. But he became sympathetic to a woman prisoner named Bathsheba (Scipio/Xerxes' wife), and this sympathy awakened feelings of remorse and guilt. Suddenly burdened by the deaths of thousands of people by his actions, Rodriguez calls upon the Holy Virgin, but concluded that even she could not cleanse his hands from \\"the oceans of blood\\" staining them, and became certain he was damned. He then shot himself dead with his submachine gun. This last act is not so much derived from religion (the Catholic Church frowns upon suicide) as from Rodriguez's personal code of honour. His stricken wife, who knew him well, would later write to her son that he could only have killed himself in order to atone for a wrong which could not be atoned for otherwise - which is precisely the truth, though his grieving family members, not having shared his epiphany about the Blacks, do not realise that this was indeed the specific terrible wrong he sought to atone for. =Rodriguez, Jorge= (AE:CCH-AE:VO; Viewpoint character SA:G-SA:ID) Jorge Rodriguez is one of three sons of Hipolito Rodriguez; Miguel and Pedro were the others. In the 1930s, he served in the Freedom Youth Corps, and later in the Second Great War. By 1943, he was part of the Army of Northern Virginia until transfer to Tennessee in the failed defense of that state. He was also part of the failed defense of Atlanta and the rest of Georgia until he was transferred by sea from Savannah to Beaufort, South Carolina. During this period, he was promoted to corporal and ended up commanding a platoon. Moving to Virginia, he fought until captured by U.S. forces near Appomattox, Virginia. He spent the rest of the war in a POW camp. He returned to Bayoreca, Sonora after the war ended, and took over management of the Rodriguez family farm. Feeling that the Confederacy was decisively defeated and that further acts of resistance would merely bring ruthless retaliation upon the townspeople, Rodriguez anonymously denounced Freedom Party organizer Robert Quinn to U.S. occupation authorities to save his older brother Pedro from being involved in a resistance which he felt would be futile. =Scipio aka Xerxes= (Viewpoint character, GW:AF- SA:G) Scipio (no last name), known as \\"Kip\\" to some, was, in 1915, the butler of Anne Colleton. He was born a slave around 1873, before the manumission following the Second Mexican War. Scipio was highly educated and was able to switch on a moment's notice between speaking with a \\"white\\" accent and with the local Black accent (Congaree). He found himself drawn by the chief hunter Cassius into the Red Rebellion of 1915 as a member of the cell controlling Marshlands, and was forced to serve as a \\"revolutionary judge\\" of the Congaree Socialist Republic and as an intermediary with Confederate forces. When the rebellion was crushed, Scipio escaped from South Carolina into Augusta, Georgia, where he assumed the name \\"Xerxes\\" and over the years worked as a waiter at several restaurants: first that of Jerry Oglethorpe, then Erasmus, a prosperous black, and finally under Jerry Dover at the prestigious Huntsman's Lodge. At one point, Anne Colleton (who had blamed Scipio for much of the destruction at her beloved Marshlands Plantation) found that Scipio worked at the Huntsman's Lodge. She came to arrest him, but Scipio wasn't working at the time. Jerry Dover, who didn't want to lose such a talented employee, convinced Anne that this wasn't the Xerxes that she wanted by showing her paperwork that proved a man named Xerxes had been working there for many years. (There had actually been another Xerxes that had worked at the Lodge years before, so the paperwork checked out for Scipio's sake.) Scipio/Xerxes married Bathsheba and had two children: Cassius and Antoinette. He found himself trapped behind the barbed wire the Confederates established around the Terry, Augusta's Black district. Jerry Dover protected his employees and their families from deportation when he could (out of personal likes and desire for restaurant efficiency, rather than from a revolutionary racial sympathy), but was then drafted into the army, thus removing Scipio's protection. Eventually, in early 1943 a Freedom Party roundup of Augusta's Blacks caught him and his family while attending church (save Cassius, who was elsewhere), and deported them west. Scipio, Bathsheba, and Antoinette were sent to Camp Determination, where he was separated from his family and sent to Barracks 27 in the men's section of the camp. He later died in the gas chambers. That was the most likely fate of a black sent to this camp, as of a Jew sent to our history's Nazi death camps; nevertheless, the death of Scipio, who had been a prominent viewpoint character for 8 previous books, is especially traumatizing to the reader, despite being obvious for a page or two before it actually happens. Scipio has always been the consummate survivor, being able to talk, sneak or threaten his way out of the tightest worst-case scenarios against all probability, but now his luck has run out. Making it even crueler is that it comes immediately after he has a falsely hopeful encounter with the guard Hipolito Rodriguez who brought him a message from his wife and daughter, but then was among the guards who led Scipio and many others to their deaths. =Semmes, Gabriel= (GW:AF-AE:BI) Gabriel Semmes was a prominent Whig politician during the Great War, and is possibly a fictitious grandson of Raphael Semmes. From 1910 to 1916, he served as Woodrow Wilson's vice-president. In the 1915 presidential election, he easily defeated Doroteo Arango, the Radical Liberal candidate from Chihuahua and became the tenth president. However, Semmes' term was marred by the Confederacy's defeat in the Great War and the subsequent loss of territory to the United States. In the aftermath of the Red Rebellion, Semmes proposed a bill to the Confederate Congress to allow black soldiers to fight in the war; this was done as a result of a shortage of available white conscripts. Semmes left office in 1922 disgraced after the C.S. loss and humiliation in the war. =Steinfeldt= (HFR) Lieutenant Colonel Steinfeldt was second in command of the Third Virginia Regiment, positioned south and west of St. Matthews during the Siege of Louisville. When the Army of Ohio made its second crossing in an attempted to outflank the Army of Kentucky while it was busy in the city of Louisville, Colonel Tinker's regimental headquarters came under heavy attack. The headquarters was hit by artillery fire and Steinfelft was killed along with Tinker. =Stuart, Jeb Jr.= (HFR, AE:BI, AE:VO) General James Ewell Brown (Jeb) Stuart Jr. is a fictionalized character in this series. There was a real JEB Stuart Jr. but he was born in 1860, and this character is said to have been born in 1864; it is unknown whether this was a gaffe on Turtledove's part, or a deliberate plot point. Stuart entered combat in 1881 as a lieutenant of infantry in the Army of Kentucky, which was charged with the defense of the state it was named for. When the US Army of the Ohio under the command of General Orlando Wilcox invaded Kentucky at Louisville, Stuart and his company distinguished themselves under fire when they held and repulsed Wilcox's flanking move. In the middle of the fighting, Stuart saved his company when its commander was wounded, and became a war hero just like his father, who was serving in the invasion of New Mexico. Right after the battle, Stuart personally met the Confederate Army chief, General Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson. For the next thirty years, Jeb Stuart, Jr. rapidly advanced through the ranks, rising to the top of the chain of command by virtue of his glory in 1881 and through the magic of his family's name, which would prove thicker than merit in the caste- world of the Confederacy. When the world went to war in 1914, Stuart was in charge of the War Department. He unleashed the Army of Northern Virginia north through Washington, DC and Maryland in a move aimed at capturing Philadelphia, the de facto capital of the United States. In 1915, as the Army of Northern Virginia stood on the Susquehanna River, disturbing reports filtered from the front to the War Department of a nature endangering the safety of the entire CSA. Many cells of Marxist black laborers had been uncovered in the various armies, one such cell including Pompey, the manservant of Stuart's son, Captain Jeb Stuart III of Battery C, First Richmond Howitzers. The accusation there had been made by one of Stuart's sergeants in Battery C, Jake Featherston, and passed on to the top by a major from Intelligence named Clarence Potter. Jeb Stuart, Jr. didn't wish to upset his son by having the manservant, Pompey, taken away for detention. He ordered the affair hushed up, not believing that Pompey was even capable of plotting rebellion or anything seditious. When the Red Rebellion of 1915-16 broke out in autumn of 1915, Pompey disappeared with the other rebels. Jeb Stuart III was now under a cloud, and when Pompey was captured and brought back to the captain for confirmation of identity, any chances of his being promoted went down the drain. Jeb Stuart III died in combat not long after the affair, recklessly attacking the enemy with the intent of being killed. Jeb Stuart, Jr. punished Sergeant Featherston and Major Potter for their parts in the controversy by blocking their promotions. Potter got over his situation; Featherston was enraged and began the descent into madness that would blaze through the world in future years. Despite the Confederacy's defeat, Stuart remained the head of the postwar Confederate Army. Though often singled out by Featherston as the example of the nepotism and conservatism which had crippled the CS Army during the war, Stuart remained silent until 1923. When President Wade Hampton V's assassination seemed sure to consign the Freedom Party to the dustbin of history, Stuart personally met with Featherston for the first time. He quietly but smugly informed Featherston that he had come to say goodbye, as he believed that the Freedom Party would no longer be a force in Confederate politics. While it did not consume his outer appearance, it seemed he deeply regretted his actions that allowed the Red Rebellion to occur. He believed that the death of his son was a result of his mistake. Stuart's confidence proved misplaced. Featherston did recover from the 1923 debacle, and eleven years later was sworn in as the Confederacy's President. Despite his campaign promises, Featherston walked softly around the army for the first two years of his presidency. But in the aftermath of a failed assassination attempt at the 1936 Richmond Olympics, Featherston's popularity was such that he felt the time had come to shake up the CS Army's leadership. He called Stuart into his office and gloatingly reminded him of their last meeting before asking for his resignation. The icy civility of both men swiftly gave way to abuse; when Stuart labeled Featherston 'white trash' the enraged president threatened to charge the general with treason for his part in facilitating the Red rebellion, as well as exposing his son's involvement with protecting the Marxist Pompey. A shaken Stuart promptly resigned. Shortly afterward news of the Pompey Affair went out over the Confederate wireless and cinema. =Stuart, Jeb III= (GW:AF-GW:WH) Son of General Jeb Stuart, Jr., and the commanding officer of Battery C in the First Richmond Howitzers, Army of Northern Virginia, Jeb Stuart III was a young man when he was promoted to captain and given command of Battery C, which helped explain his cockiness and self-assured stance on whatever situation arose. When his manservant, a black man named Pompey, came under investigation for possible connections to the Confederate Marxist underground, Stuart was convinced of his servant's innocence. He asked his father, the head of the CSA War Department, to cancel the investigation, never finding out that it was one of his own sergeants, Jake Featherston, who tipped off Army Intelligence about Pompey. When the black Marxists finally rose up in revolt in the autumn of 1915, Pompey was discovered to be the leader of one of the cells in the Army, which included Featherston's gun handlers Nero and Perseus, among others. Pompey was captured and was later, we assume, executed (we never hear of his actual fate), but before the sentence was carried out Major Clarence Potter, who had led the earlier investigation, chastised Captain Stuart for his mistake. Shortly thereafter, during a U.S. Army breakthrough on that front in Maryland, Stuart ordered Sergeant Featherston to unlimber his gun and fight the U.S. soldiers to their last breath. He was shot and killed immediately afterward, having openly exposed his body to the enemy marksmen; he intended to die in a blaze of glory to atone for ignoring the signs of black rebellion. For their roles in the controversy, both Sergeant Featherston and Major Potter were punished by Captain Stuart's father, being blacklisted from further promotion in the Confederate States Army. It was the events surrounding Jeb Stuart III and Pompey that sparked Jake Featherston's intense racism and contempt for the Confederate aristocracy, leading to his involvement in the newly formed Freedom Party and his rise to power. =Tinker= (HFR) Colonel Tinker was the commanding officer of the Third Virginia during the Second Mexican War, positioned south and west of St. Matthews during the Siege of Louisville. When the Army of Ohio made its second crossing in an attempt outflank the Army of Kentucky while it was busy in the city of Louisville, Colonel Tinker regiment came under heavy attack. His headquarters was hit by artillery fire and he got killed. =Wood, Apicius= (GW:AF-GW:B) Before the Great War, Apicius (no last name) was the proprietor of The Kentucky Smoke House, a barbecue restaurant in Covington, Kentucky, which was patronized by both the white and black community. He was also the head of the Marxist underground in Covington, and thus was involved in a three-way fight between the Marxists, the Confederate underground (led by Tom Kennedy), and the Kentucky State Police led by Luther Bliss. He adopted the surname \\"Wood\\" when blacks were allowed to take surnames in 1916 during the short period of U.S. rule, because \\"you can't make good barbecue without good wood.\\" He died in 1925, and his son Lucullus continued to run the barbecue and the Marxist underground during the Second Great War. However, Cincinnatus Driver, revisiting Covington in 1944, was unable to find any of the Woods, and surmised that Lucullus had been killed by Featherston's brutal policies. CanadaMcGregor, Arthur= (Viewpoint character, GW:AF-AE:BI) Arthur McGregor owned a farm in southern Manitoba near the town of Rosenfeld. The town was occupied by United States forces early in the Great War. When his 15-year-old son, Alexander, was arrested and then shot by the U.S. Army for sabotage (based on only circumstantial evidence), McGregor began a secret campaign of bombing American institutions. He remained undetected for years, but his luck ran out in the 1920s when he attempted to kill General George Armstrong Custer with a bomb. Alone amongst US officers, Custer strongly suspected McGregor was a bomber (despite no evidence having been found to convict him). Custer noticed McGregor in the crowd during Custer's retirement parade. When McGregor threw a bomb at Custer, Custer caught the bomb and threw it back at McGregor, killing him instantly. McGregor had a daughter named Mary, who later married Mort Pomeroy. She continued in her father's footsteps, secretly making bombs to keep the American occupiers off guard. =McGregor, Mary (Pomeroy)= (GW:AF-AE:BI, Viewpoint character AE:CCH-SA:DE) Mary McGregor was the daughter of Arthur McGregor, the prominent Anti-American Canadian nationalist. She had married Mort Pomeroy, the owner of a Rosenfeld, Manitoba diner, in the 1930s and had one son, Alexander Arthur (\\"Alec\\") Pomeroy (named for his uncle and grandfather). Mary continued her father's legacy after his accidental death in 1923, by carrying out a series of bombings. Among other attacks, she planted a bomb in Rosenfeld's general store, and sent a mail bomb which killed Laura Moss and Dorothy Moss. She was arrested by American soldiers at her childhood home outside of Rosenfeld in 1942, and was caught with explosives. She was tried on terrorism and weapons- related charges and sentenced to death. Reluctant to execute a woman (especially the mother of a young child), she was urged to plead for mercy, thus in effect being offered a way out. However, she refused and tried to stop her lawyer from appealing, consciously and deliberately making herself a martyr for the cause. As a result, appeals by her lawyer proved unsuccessful, and she was executed by firing squad. Though not explicitly mentioned, since after her death there is no Canadian viewpoint character left, her proud stance and widely publicised martyrdom might have helped to set off the uprising in Canada, mentioned soon afterwards. =Pomeroy, Alexander Arthur= (AE:VO-SA:G) Alec Pomeroy is the son of Mort and Mary Pomeroy. He was named for his late uncle Alexander and his late grandfather Arthur MacGregor. Born in 1936, he was only six years old when his mother was executed by U.S. firing squads after a series of bombings. Earlier, Mort Pomeroy ‚Äì though by no means liking the occupying Yankees ‚Äì was not a white-hot patriot, striving to make the best of the situation (with a considerable economic success), and trying (this without success) to dissuade Mary from her bombing campaign against the Americans. As evident from the fact that in 1943 Pomeroy's Diner was the point of most persistent resistance to the American forces invading Rosenfeld, the execution of his beloved wife pushed Mort to extreme militancy and resistance until his own death at Yankee hands. The six-year-old Alexander was the lone survivor of the U.S. assault on the diner turned stronghold. He lost a joint on his pinkie, which was bandaged by Armstrong Grimes; though Grimes acted kind towards him and gave him a candy bar, Alec, who just lost his father, was ungrateful towards him and the other U.S. soldiers. His ingratitude was ignored. =Secord, Laura (Moss)= (GW:B-AE:VO) Laura Secord was a Canadian farmer descended from (and named for) the Canadian patriot of the War of 1812. She lived in Berlin, Ontario, and lost her first husband, a Canadian soldier, during the Great War. After the war ended, she established an antagonistic but oddly strong relationship with an American pilot named Jonathan Moss, who moved to the town (now a part of Occupied Canada) to establish his career as an attorney in military occupation courts - a decision taken, to a considerable degree, by Moss' love for her and determination to win her, as well as by Moss' guilty feeling about his acts during the war and his feeling that the Canadians were \\"getting a raw deal\\". Eventually, the two got married and had a daughter, Dorothy. Laura and her daughter were killed (while Jonathan was at work) by a mail bomb sent to them by Mary MacGregor Pomeroy, who saw Laura Moss as a traitor to their country. Republic of QuebecGaltier, Lucien= (Viewpoint character GW:AF-AE:VO) Lucien Galtier was a farmer in Rivi√®re-du-Loup, Quebec, which was occupied by U.S. forces early in the Great War. Although not expressing overt hostility to the U.S. occupation, the occupiers decided to confiscate part of his land to build a military hospital. After his daughter, Nicole, married Leonard O'Doull, one of the U.S. Army surgeons, the U.S. military government and the government of the new Republic of Quebec decided that Galtier was friendly, and he was compensated for the land and paid back rent. The Republic of Quebec later bought the land the hospital was built on for a large sum. That money, combined with the rent he had received, made him one of the wealthier farmers in the area. His wife died of cancer a few years after the war ended, and he died of a heart attack while \\"enjoying the company\\" of his new lady-friend, Eloise Granche, a few months before the 1941 war began. His son, Charles, inherited the farm. The careers of Galtier and of Arthur McGregor are evidently intended as a kind of symmetrical pair. Both start off in very similar circumstances, as hard- working Canadian farmers who both resent the American occupation but (to start with) neither opposing it head-on. However, the circumstance of Galtier's daughter falling in love with an American and marrying him, while MacGregor's son was unjustly executed by the Americans, draws the two in diametrically opposite directions. =Talon, Pascal= (GW:AF-AE:CCH) Father Pascal Talon was a Catholic priest in Rivi√®re-du-Loup. An opportunist as well as a man of the cloth, he supported the Americans early in the occupation, assisting U.S. Army Major Jedediah Quigley with the pacification of his area by delivering pro-American sermons to his congregation. He was made Bishop in 1916 when his church in Rivi√®re-du-Loup became the seat of a diocese. This coincided with the establishment of the Republic of Quebec and may be evidence of cooperation between the Holy See and the Central Powers. In 1926 Bishop Pascal found himself at the center of a scandal when it was revealed that he had taken a mistress and had fathered twins with her. He was very abruptly defrocked. As a layman, he married the mother of his twins and moved his family to Quebec City to begin a new life and a political career with the intent to make Quebec more like the United States. As Lucien Galtier noted, Pascal served God and himself at the same time. Empire of MexicoMaximilian II= (HFR) Maximilian II had served as the Emperor of Mexico since at least 1880. He maintained the close ties between his country and France. In 1881, with his nation desperate for money, Maximilian II decided to sell the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora to the Confederate States, which would cause the Second Mexican War with the United States. The following year, the war ended with a Confederate and allied victory and the US was forced to recognize Chihuahua and Sonora as Confederate territory. =Francisco Jos√© I= Francisco Jos√© I served as the Emperor of Mexico after Maximilian II. During his reign as emperor, he saw Mexico enter the Great War on the side of the Entente Powers with the Confederate States, the United Kingdom, France, and Russia. Despite the Entente Powers losing the war, Mexico did not lose any territory to the Central Powers. =Maximilian III= (AE:CCH-VO) Maximilian III served as the Emperor of Mexico after Francisco I. During his reign as emperor during the late 1910s and early 1920s, anti-Habsburg Revolutionaries sought to remove him from the throne and sparked the Mexican Civil War in 1917. The Revolutionaries were supported by the United States while the Monarchs were supported by the Confederate States. The civil war ended with a Monarch victory in 1925 and Maximilian's throne was safe. He served as the emperor until at least 1942 and saw the beginning of the Second Great War and Mexico join the Entente Powers once again. =Francisco Jos√© II= (SA:RE-SA:ID) Francisco Jos√© II is Emperor of Mexico in the 1940s (successor of Maximilian III), and as such, analogous to the role of minor Axis leaders in our timeline, particularly Benito Mussolini of Italy, and, in the case of the Battle of Pittsburgh (analog to our timeline's Battle of Stalingrad), Ion Antonescu of Romania. He is a descendant of the House of Habsburg, his name being a Hispanization of \\"Franz Josef\\". Ironically, he finds himself a minor partner in the Entente fighting against his ancestral Austria-Hungary. During the Second Great War, he sent his three best army divisions to assist the Confederate States in Operation Coalscuttle in Pennsylvania. These forces were annihilated in General Morrell's counterattack, which led to the destruction of the Confederate army in Pittsburgh. Afterwards, Confederate Secretary of State George Herbert Walker 'persuaded' him to provide five more divisions for use as 'internal security' against Negro marauders. Not much is known about the Emperor personally. He was one of the few Entente heads of state to remain as such after the war without being killed (as Charles XI of France, Jake Featherston of the CSA, and (possibly) Michael II of Russia were) or voted out of office (as Winston Churchill was). It is also unclear what genetic stock the series' fictitious Mexican emperors come from. The only real monarchs of that Empire - Maximilian and Carlota - are generally regarded by historians as having been an infertile couple. The historical Maximilian indicated that he planned to adopt Agust√≠n de Iturbide y Green and Salvador de Iturbide y Marz√°n, the grandsons of Agust√≠n I, as his heirs. FranceCharles XI= (AE:CCH- AE:VO, SA:ID) King Charles XI was put in power by the Action Fran√ßaise movement in post-Great War France. After the overthrow of the French Third Republic around 1930, Charles XI took the movement's position to reclaim Alsace-Lorraine from Germany. When Kaiser Wilhelm II died on 4 June 1941, Charles XI formally demanded the return of Alsace-Lorraine. After Wilhelm's successor Wilhelm III denied this request, France, supported by the United Kingdom and the Confederate States, declared war on Germany, and the Second Great War began. Charles XI was killed in the superbomb attack on Paris in 1944 and was succeeded by King Louis XIX, who made an armistice with Germany. There was formerly a popular consensus that Charles XI is historical politician Charles Maurras. In a tweet in 2020, Turtledove flatly denied this. =Louis XIX= (SA:ID) King Louis XIX became the King of France in 1944 after Charles XI was killed in the German superbomb attack that destroyed most of Paris. He initially announced France's intention to continue to fight Germany, but ultimately accepted capitulation. Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoul√™me had technically reigned as King Louis XIX of France on 2 August 1830, albeit for a mere twenty minutes. The correct name of the monarch should be Louis XX, although not all monarchists accept the Louis XIX of 1830 as a true king. Empire of BrazilDom Pedro IV= (GW:B) Dom Pedro IV is the Emperor of Brazil during the Great War. Through most of the war, he keeps his country neutral, although both sides actively court him. In 1917, when it is clear that the Central Powers have the upper-hand, Dom Pedro IV declares war on the Entente. Brazil's entry into the war bottles up Argentina and cuts off a valuable supply line to the United Kingdom, which helps to accelerate the Entente's capitulation.

The publisher was Scanlan's Literary House. Edited by Warren Hinckle III and Sidney Zion, it featured politically controversial muckraking and was ultimately subject to an investigation by the FBI during the Nixon administration. It was boycotted by printers as \\"un-American\\" by 1971. According to the publishers, more than 50 printers refused to handle the January 1971 special issue Guerilla War in the USA because it appeared to be promoting domestic terrorism. The issue was finally printed in Quebec and in a German translation in Stuttgart (Guerilla-Krieg in USA, Deutsche Verlagsanstalt 1971). The magazine produced a total of eight issues during its existence. Scanlan's is best-remembered for featuring several articles by Hunter S. Thompson, and especially for what is considered the first instance of gonzo journalism, Thompson's \\"The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved\\". Thompson's articles from this period are collected with others in The Great Shark Hunt. In the magazine, its name was described as being that of a \\"universally despised Irish pig farmer\\". The September 1970 issue included an editorial entitled, \\"Nixon And The Bums\\", with an accompanying picture of President Nixon having lunch with a group of construction union leaders who attended the so-called White House Hard Hat Luncheon. The editorial identified each of the individuals and enumerated each one's alleged criminal record. To advertise the issue, Scanlan's ran two full-page ads in the New York Times which were noticed by The White House. This was the primary reason for the enmity that ensued in Washington.

Medland's 1792 engraving of W. Hilton's ca. 1791 colour oil painting. George Cartwright (12 February 1739/40 - 19 May 1819) was an English army officer and a trader and explorer in Newfoundland and Labrador. His name is borne by Cartwright, a settlement at the entrance to Sandwich Bay.  Early Life and Family  George Cartwright was born at Marnham in Nottinghamshire, England, an elder brother of Edmund Cartwright, clergyman and inventor of the power loom, and of John Cartwright, naval officer and English parliamentary reformer. Army career Cartwright became a gentleman cadet in the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, London when he was fifteen. He served in India as ensign in the 39th Foot. In 1759, he was promoted lieutenant while in Ireland. In 1760 he was aide-de-camp to the Marquess of Granby in Germany and a staff officer under Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick. He was brevetted captain in 1762, returned to England and went on half pay from 1762 to 1766. In 1766, Cartwright was commissioned Captain in the 37th Foot, and went to Minorca during 1766 and 1767. Voyages to Newfoundland and Labrador George Cartwright's brother John Cartwright was first lieutenant on HMS Guernsey. In the 1766 season, George Cartwright cruised the Newfoundland coast on this vessel with his brother. In 1768, George Cartwright went to Newfoundland again and accompanied John Cartwright's voyage attempting to contact the Beothuk people on the Exploits river. Between 1770 and 1786, Cartwright occupied a number of fishing and furring stations from Cape Charles to Sandwich Bay and developed connections with the Inuit and Innu people there. His financial successes was mixed at best, and his many setbacks included being thoroughly raided by American privateers in 1778. This came about when his servant Dominick Kinnien defected to join the crew of the Bostonian John Grimes.D. W. Prowse, A history of Newfoundland from the English, colonial, and foreign records, p. 600. London: 1895. Accessed 18 August 2016. In 1772, Cartwright brought five Inuit individuals from what was then called Labrador. However, it is ambiguous to whether or not this was done forcefully or in collaboration with the chosen individuals. Traveling on this ship to England was Atajug, his youngest wife Ikkanguaq and their toddler daughter Ikiunaq. Joining Atajug‚Äôs family was Atajug‚Äôs younger brother Tuglavingaaq and his wife Qavvik, also known as Caubvick. They traveled with Cartwright to Ireland and England, where they were a sensation, drawing the attention of King George III, Joseph Banks, John Hunter, James Boswell, Samuel Johnson, and great crowds. Similar to other Indigenous travellers to London in the past, this Inuit family was ‚Äúsubjected to the spectacle of Georgian London.‚Äù The intention was both to show off the Imperial city and to show off them, the Inuit family, to the curious and consumer eyes of London society. In May, 1773, Cartwright and Atajug‚Äôs family started the journey home. However, before they had even left the Thames, Qavvik fell ill with smallpox. Three weeks later Atajuq, Ikkanguaq, Ikiunaq and Tuglavingaaq had all died. Qavvik lived, returning to Labrador. Nearly a year later, Cartwright noted the devastation that followed Qavvik‚Äôs return. ‚ÄúThe Inuit of southern Labrador were almost entirely wiped out by the disease.‚Äù Later life in England In 1786, Cartwright returned to England. He published his diary in 1792 and continued to be interested in the politics and business of Labrador. He was barracks master of the Nottingham Militia from some time during the Napoleonic Wars until 1817. He died in 1819 in Mansfield, England. He had an unparalleled love for Labrador until his death ‚Äî as is shown, for example, in his lengthy and somewhat tedious piece of verse, of which this is a small extract: :Fish, Fowl and Ven‚Äôson now our tables grace: :Roast Beaver too, and ev‚Äôry Beast of Chase. :Luxurious living this! who'd wish for more? :Were Quin alive, he'd haste to Labrador!George Cartwright, Labrador: A Poetical Epistle, page 19.

It was directed by William Cameron Menzies and distributed by Allied Artists Pictures. This was to be the second 3-D film designed and directed by William Cameron Menzies, who was known as a director with a very \\"dimensional\\" style (e.g. many shots are focused in layers). This was his final film as production designer and director. Plot A Scotsman named Gerald MacTeam (Richard Carlson) abruptly breaks off his engagement to pretty Kitty (Veronica Hurst) after receiving word of his uncle's death. He inherits a mysterious castle in the Scottish highlands and moves there to live with the castle servants. Kitty refuses to accept the broken engagement and travels with her aunt (Katherine Emery) to the castle. When they arrive, they discover that Gerald has suddenly aged and his manner has changed significantly. After a series of mysterious events occur in both the castle and the hedge maze outside, they invite a group of friends, including a doctor, to the castle in the hopes that they can help Gerald with whatever ails him. Although the friends are equally concerned by Gerald's behavior, they are at a loss as to its cause. One night, Kitty and her aunt steal a key to their bedroom door (which is always locked from the outside) and sneak out into the mysterious maze. There they discover Gerald and his servants tending to a frog-like monster. The monster panics upon seeing the strangers and runs back to the castle, hurling itself from a top-story balcony to its death. At the end, Gerald explains that the amphibious creature was the actual master of the castle, Sir Roger MacTeam, and that he and his ancestors were merely its servants. The death of Sir Roger releases him from his obligation and he is able to return to a normal life.

Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film two out of four stars, calling the finale \\"ludicrous (and unsatisfying)\\". Brett Gallman from Oh, the Horror! gave the film a negative review, criticizing the film's \\"bloated\\" runtime, and plot development, calling it a footnote in director Menzies' career. Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews awarded the film a grade B, calling it, \\"A moronic but entertaining horror/sci fi film.\\" TV Guide awarded the film two out of four stars, commending the film's acting, direction, and set design, calling it above-average. However, the reviewer felt that the film was somewhat hampered by its low budget. Dave Sindelar, on his website Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings gave the film a more positive review, writing, \\"I have a lot of affection for this eerie horror/SF movie, though it took me a couple of viewings. The first time I saw the movie, I did get caught up in the eerie mood and the atmospheric sense of dread and tragedy that pervaded the castle, but the revelation concerning the nature of the true lord of the castle caused me to break out in laughter rather than to rear back in horror, and it ruined the movie for me. The second time I saw it, I was prepared, and was able to see beyond this flaw and appreciate how touching and sad the ending of the movie was.

Bridgeville is located on the Neversink River on New York State Route 17 (future Interstate 86), at an elevation of . It has hilly terrain. Since Bridgeville is not a corporate entity and does not have a post office of its own, population figures are not available. See Town of Thompson for area demographic information. Bridgeville shares a ZIP code with nearby Monticello of 12701 and telephone area code 845. Attractions The Neversink River is well known for fly-fishing and Bridgeville is a popular location for fishermen. Bridgeville is also the site of Holiday Mountain Ski Park. History right Indigenous inhabitants of this area included members of the Algonquian and Lene Lenape (aka Delaware) tribes. Bridgeville was the site of the first covered bridge in New York State, built in 1807 to facilitate construction of the Newburgh-Cochecton Turnpike, a major frontier thoroughfare connecting communities on the Delaware and Hudson rivers. From Newburgh, the turnpike took the route of the modern N.Y. State Route 17K to Bloomingburg in the Town of Mamakating, from there following the present N.Y. State Route 17 (future I-86), and thence for the entire length of N.Y. State Route 17B from Monticello west to Cochecton, on the upper Delaware. The ambitious project of building this road opened new territory for European conquest and development, spread commerce and greatly enhanced the tanning industry, which subsequently provided much of the leather used in boots for Union soldiers during the American Civil War. The old bridge was demolished in 1923, replaced by the present-day span (Sullivan County Bridge #285) over the Neversink River. According to a marker that was placed on the original bridge, the architect was Maj.

An early 19th- century hand-drawn lubok, attributed to Mikhail Grigoriev. The Solovetsky Monastery uprising (–°–æ–ª–æ–≤–µ—Ü–∫–æ–µ –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–µ in Russian) was an uprising of Old Believer monks, known as the Raskol, of the northern Solovetsky Monastery against the policies of Tsar Aleksey I. The uprising involved the siege of the Solovetsky Monastery by the Tsar's forces over the years from 1668 to 1676. The uprising started in the summer of 1668, when the high-ranking clergy of the monastery rose in opposition to Patriarch Nikon‚Äôs ecclesiastic reform soon after his defrocking. The majority of regular monks came out against the centralization of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian government, which had been reinforcing this centralization. Lay brothers, monastic workers, and pilgrims (–ø—Ä–∏—à–ª—ã–µ –ª—é–¥–∏, or prishliye lyudi) protested against the feudal oppression and monastic serfdom regulations in particular. An estimated 450-500 rebels took part in the Solovetsky Monastery Uprising, which began under the slogan of the struggle for the \\"Old Faith\\" in connection with the Old Believers movement (see Raskol). On June 22, 1668, a Streltsy unit under the command of I. Volkhov arrived at the Solovetsky Islands to suppress the rebels. The monastery locked itself up and refused to let the Streltsy in. The uprising was supported by local peasants and workers (—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –ª—é–¥–∏, or rabotniye lyudi), which would allow the monastery to withstand more than seven years of siege without experiencing any serious difficulties with food supplies and other necessities. Beside the regular food assistance from the outside, many visiting workers, runaway soldiers, and even Streltsy made their way onto the island and joined the rebels. In the early 1670s, a large number of Stenka Razin‚Äôs supporters joined the monastery uprising, which boosted it even more. The besieged would often sally out of the monastery under the leadership of elected sotniks, such as the runaway boyar kholop I.Voronin, monastery peasant S.Vasiliev. The runaway Don Cossacks P.Zapruda and G.Krivonoga supervised the construction of new fortifications. By 1674, there had already been some 1000 Streltsy and a large number of guns outside the walls of the Solovetsky Monastery. The siege was now headed by voyevoda I.Mescherinov. The rebels had been successfully defending themselves until their betrayal by a monk named Feoktist, who showed the Streltsy an unprotected window of the monastery‚Äôs White Tower. This brought about the end of the uprising, which was suppressed with incredible brutality in January 1676. Only sixty rebels out of five hundred survived the seizure of the monastery. Large supplies of food were discovered stored in the monastery which would have been sufficient to withstand siege for several more years. Almost all of the remaining insurgents were later executed.

It quickly grew to be one of the world's largest bulletin board systems in the 1980s and throughout the 1990s, competing with the likes of Compuserve and Prodigy. ExecPC began offering Internet access in 1994 as ExecPC Internet, and being based in New Berlin, WI, quickly grew to be the largest Internet service provider in Wisconsin. The company was sold in 1998 to Voyager.net of East Lansing, MI. After a lengthy series of acquisitions, the assets are now held by LocalNet of Buffalo, NY.http://www.localnet.com/releases1.phtml Retrieved 12 July 2007  History  The Exec-PC BBS = 300 px The Exec-PC BBS launched on November 28, 1983 in the den of owner Bob Mahoney. Known primarily for its extensive shareware software archives, the BBS also offered E-mail, message forums, and BBS door games to paying subscribers.Jason Scott Sadofsky (July 2001 ‚Äì December 2004), BBS: The Documentary (3 DVDs) As the file archives grew in size, Mahoney created the Hyperscan feature, allowing members to quickly search for files by keyword ‚Äî a common feature today, but rare at the time. Mahoney became one of the earliest BBS operators to begin charging a fee for access to a BBS. The Exec-PC BBS grew to over 250 lines, with over 300 GB of file storage at its peak in the mid-90s. Callers could connect to the Exec-PC BBS via long distance at no additional charge, or connect to any CompuServe local access number for a per-minute fee. In 1996, the file collection of the Exec-PC BBS was placed on the world-wide web through the Filepile.com web site. Filepile.com was officially abandoned in 1999 having been made obsolete by other Internet services. = Exec-PC Chat = One of the major missing features of the Exec-PC BBS was the ability to speak with other members of the service in chat rooms. Instead of building chat functionality into the BBS, Mahoney created a separate system, Exec-PC Chat, which ran alongside the Exec- PC BBS. This system was a Major BBS-based system with 48 lines. While popular, the chat system did not prove to be profitable, and Mahoney divested himself of the system. The former Exec-PC Chat ran under the name Over the Edge until shutting down in 1996. = ExecPC Internet = Sensing the promise of the Internet, Mahoney built Internet functionality into the Exec-PC BBS in 1994. When calling into certain numbers known as \\"gold nodes,\\" the BBS member was connected to an Internet shell account on servers run by IBM's VNET division. This solution quickly proved to be slow and confusing to members, so Mahoney set up a separate division of the company that same year to provide dialup access via both shell accounts and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). Unlike the BBS, ExecPC Internet provided service exclusively to individuals in Wisconsin and northern Illinois. ExecPC Internet proved to be tremendously popular, and grew from its first paying subscribers in 1994 to just over 80,000 subscribers in 1998. As it grew, the company added business-class access services such as ISDN and T1 lines, as well as web hosting service. = Mergers and Acquisitions = In September, 1998, Mahoney sold ExecPC to East Lansing, MI- based Voyager.net. Voyager.net was purchased by CoreComm Ltd. in October, 2000, who then, through other acquisitions, became ATX Communications in 2004. In December, 2005, ATX Communications sold the remaining ExecPC assets and customer base to LocalNet of Buffalo, NY, the current operators.

The company was formed in March 2005 through the merger of video game developers Backbone Entertainment and The Collective.  History  Foundation 9 Entertainment was founded on March 29, 2005, in Los Angeles, through the merger of video game developer Backbone Entertainment and The Collective. The company's initial management board consisted of Jon Goldman (chief executive officer), Andrew Ayre and Douglas Hare (co-presidents), Gary Priest and Mark Loughridge (co-chairmen), Richard Hare (chief creative officer), Jeff Vavasour (vice-president of Canadian operations), Steven Sardegna (chief financial officer), and Larry Kelly (chief operating officer). Shortly after the merger, on April 12, Foundation 9 acquired and integrated Pipeworks Software. Subsequently, Dan Duncalf, the company's president and co- founder, joined Foundation 9's board of directors. In May, Foundation 9 acquired an equity stake in Circle of Confusion, a Hollywood management company, to establish a strategic partnership. On June 1, 2006, investment firm Francisco Partners (as advised by UBS Securities) agreed to provide in funding to Foundation 9 over a time frame of several years, with additional funding to be provided when needed. The investment was followed by the acquisitions of Shiny Entertainment from Atari in October 2006, Amaze Entertainment and related studios in November 2006, and Sumo Digital and its Indian sub-studio in August 2007. Under the terms of Shiny's acquisition, the studio would co-locate and merge with The Collective. The merger was formally announced in October 2007, at which point both studios had moved to new offices in Irvine, California. The amalgam was named Double Helix Games in March 2008. In January 2008, Foundation 9 promoted David Mann (previously chief operating officer), Chris Charla and Jack Brummet to president, vice- president of business development, and vice-president of quality assurance, respectively, followed by James North-Hearn, one of Sumo Digital's founders, becoming the chief executive officer of the company in March. In July 2008, Foundation 9 reinstated Griptonite Games and Fizz Factor, two studios absorbed into Amaze in 2005, under their original brandings. However, in July 2009, Fizz Factor was closed down entirely, while Amaze was merged into Griptonite and Double Helix suffered staff cuts. FXLabs, based in Hyderabad, India, was acquired by Foundation 9 in October 2010 and became part of Griptonite under the name Griptonite India. Griptonite was sold to Glu Mobile in August 2011 in exchange for 6 million shares of Glu's common stock. Backbone's location in Vancouver had been closed in May 2009, and in October 2012, its ImaginEngine studio was closed as well, while its primary location in Emeryville, California, laid off the majority of its staff. In February 2014, Double Helix was sold to Amazon. Later that year, under advisory from GP Bullhound, Foundation 9 sold Pipeworks to Italian publisher Digital Bros, and Sumo Digital to its own management, the latter of which was backed by NorthEdge Capital. In 2015, Foundation 9's board of directors elected to dissolve the company.

Life and works  Hayes was born in Birmingham, England, where, aged 12, he was selected to attend the Moseley School of Art. In 1961 he left to study at the Birmingham College of Art before travelling extensively in Africa. Over the course of several years, he worked as a ceramic artist with tribes and village potters who inspired him with the exquisite work they produced using very limited technology and tools. Moving on to India, Nepal, Japan, Korea and New Mexico, he found similar skills and adopted the techniques he learned. In 1982, Hayes came home and built a studio in a disused toll house on Cleveland Bridge, Bath. His work now builds on the techniques and methods he learned during his travels to create ceramic art that is often inspired by memories of landscapes he has seen. The distinctive appearance of Peter Hayes‚Äô ceramic works is partly a result of techniques such as Raku firing he employs but also reflects his habit of submerging pieces in the flowing river beside his studio, or sending them to Cornwall to be washed in the sea, for months at a time. The water washes minerals such as copper and metal oxides into the basic white clay with which Hayes works, creating a characteristic green-blue \\"blush\\" in his sculptures along with random elements that make every piece unique. The effect is to create objects that many feel look ancient and perhaps even a little alien. Hayes' work is generally finished by waxing and polishing.

The rally originally ended in Ulan Bator, Mongolia. However, to avoid punitive costs and taxes associated with vehicle imports and disposal, the rally now passes through Mongolia and ends in Ulan Ude. The principal launch is from Goodwood Circuit in the United Kingdom, with subsidiary starting points in the Czech Republic. It is described as the \\"Greatest Adventure in the World\\" and sees on average a 70% completion rate. There are three fundamental Rules of the Rally: #Rally vehicles have a 1200cc engine limit #Rally teams are unsupported #Rally teams need to raise at least ¬£1000 for charity The organizers (\\"The Adventurists\\") are careful to point out that racing on highways is illegal. There are other differences from mainstream rallies, particularly the fact that no support team is provided and no other arrangements are made such as for accommodation, maintenance, or fuel. History The inaugural rally took place in 2004, in which 6 teams started and 4 completed the course. The second rally, in 2005, was entered by 43 teams, and 18 automobiles arrived intact in Ulan Bator. The 2006 Rally began on 22 July with 167 cars setting off. 117 teams made it to Ulan Bator. Mongol Rally 2017 car on the street of Baku, Azerbaijan. The Mongol Rally was run as a charity event from 2004 to 2006 with all of the proceeds from the entry fees used to organise the event with the remaining donated to charity. This changed from 2007 as the event is now organised by the League of Adventurists International Ltd, a privately owned profit making UK company. However, the participants continue to raise money for charities through sponsorship. The 2007 rally left Hyde Park, London, on 21 July and was limited to 200 teams. Registration for 2007 was far more popular than the organisers could have foreseen, with the first 100 places allocated in 22 seconds. Due to this popularity, the final 50 places were awarded on the result of a ballot. In 2007, places were awarded for 2008 in two sign ups with places assigned on 1 November and 7 November. The entry fee was ¬£650 per team. The main British starting point moved from Hyde Park, London, to Goodwood in West Sussex for the 2009 to 2012 events. Cars lapped the circuit in procession before departing. In 2013 the launch was from Bodiam Castle in Sussex and in 2014 it returned to London, launching from Battersea Park.  Routes  Typical Mongolian road. There are an array of suggested routes that teams may take. After setting off from Goodwood or one of the other Western European start points (including France, Italy, and Spain), participants then generally proceed to a launch party in Prague where they converge. Typical routes then head for Moscow, Kiev or Istanbul, though teams have travelled as far north as the Arctic Circle and as far south as Iran, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan. Teams taking the Ukraine/Russia route or the more southerly Turkey and Iran route often converge at Samarkand, Uzbekistan before proceeding north-east for Mongolia. Improvised recovery of an ambulance during the 2010 rally The final leg of the rally takes surviving vehicles into Mongolia and on to finish back in Russia in Ulan-Ude. None of the available routes is comfortable or safe: damage to cars, robberies and minor injuries are common. Year on year as the rally gains popularity, more and more car accidents occur and many participants require hospital treatment. On 6 August 2010, one British participant died and one other team mate was seriously hurt after a road accident in Iran (near the border between Iran and Turkmenistan). Depending on the route taken, the total distance driven is around eight to ten thousand miles (approximately thirteen to sixteen thousand kilometres) and most teams complete the rally within three to four weeks. The most countries ever passed through on the Mongol Rally is currently 41, done in 2018 by an Australian team, Destined to Flail.  Vehicles  Mini with red telephone box embarking on the 2008 rally The original rules stated cars should be under 1000cc with no age limit. In 2009 Mongolian import restrictions meant that vehicles must be less than 10 years old and the engine limit was raised to 1200cc to account for the difficulty in finding modern cars under 1000cc. In 2013 Mongolian import restrictions meant that vehicles had to be less than 5 years old. Because vehicles less than 5 years old are outside the budget of many people in 2014 the rules were 'devolved' it was decided that cars of any age would be allowed on the Rally but they must be removed from Mongolia after the event. Without the import restrictions the engine size limit has reverted to 1000cc. = Motorcycles = Motorcycles and scooters of up to 125cc are permitted on the Rally.https://www.theadventurists.com/brochures/mongol-rally/ = Other vehicles = Comedy vehicles have always been welcome on the rally, but from 2010 to 2013 if they were over 1200cc or over 9 years old they needed to be removed after the Rally. From 2006 to 2012 emergency service vehicles were accepted for donation in Mongolia if they were in good condition, but in 2013 it was decided that Mongolia had no longer any practical need for these vehicles as it had begun to get new emergency vehicles from Japan and Korea. = After the rally = Some of the cars do not make it to Mongolia; they are sold when they break down, or are left behind due to time pressure. They may not be simply abandoned without the participants responsible losing a deposit lodged with the organisers. Previous rally vehicles can now be found operating throughout Central Asia thanks to enterprising local mechanics who have repaired abandoned vehicles. ≈†koda S110 used by ≈†koda Power Turbo Racing Team in the 2006 rally. A typical entrant prior to the 2009 rule change regarding age While the cars were imported to Mongolia and donated or sold for charity until 2013, in 2014 all Mongol Rally cars were shipped or driven back to Europe. The shipped cars were either collected by their owners or scrapped. Prior to 2014 the organisers made arrangements for the cars to be imported into Mongolia without import duties. From 2004-06 they made use of a standard procedure used by non-profit making organisations, charities, and non- governmental organisations in Mongolia that provides exemption from the most significant taxes levied on older vehicles. Under Mongolian law the importing organization in Mongolia was then prevented from selling the vehicle for 3 years. Since 2007 the organizers had a special agreement with the Mongolian government. The cars will be auctioned and the money raised donated to a project as chosen by the drivers of each car. There were many organizations in Mongolia who were grateful for the vehicles; furthermore, the low cost of labour in Mongolia made it economical to repair and run old cars that would be scrapped in Europe. Nevertheless, due to the concerns, the organizers of the Rally stipulated in the contract with teams in 2006 that they should not remove components from the car, such as the rear seats, to ensure that the vehicles remained useful and achieved a reasonable return at auction.  Teams  On average, between 250 and 300 teams enter the rally annually. Most teams have 2-4 people.  Entry fee History of the fee= In 2004 there was no entry fee, although the 6 teams had to raise a minimum of ¬£500 each, to be paid directly to that year's rally charity Send a Cow. In 2005, an entry fee of ¬£50 per person was paid to the organisers to cover the expenses of the rally. Teams were also required to raise a minimum charity donation of ¬£1000 per team split equally and paid directly to the chosen Charities Send a Cow and Save the Children. In 2006, the entry fee payable to the organisers was increased to ¬£227. Teams were required to raise a minimum of ¬£1000 per team: ¬£250 payable to Send a Cow with the remaining ¬£750 payable to either Mercy Corps, CAMDA, Wild Cru or the Christina Noble Children's Foundation. In 2006, the teams taking part in the Rally together raised in excess of ¬£200,000 for the Rally charities. Since 2009 the entry fee has been set at ¬£650, with an additional minimum charity donation set at ¬£1000 per vehicle and a vehicle deposit of ¬£500‚Äìrepayable providing the vehicle is not dumped anywhere en route.  Organizers  The Mongol Rally is now organized by the company set up by the founder, Tom Morgan, called The League of Adventurists International Limited (number 05995303) incorporated on 10 November 2006.  Sponsorship and TV coverage  On the 2006 rally a number of TV crews accompanied teams along the route. The 2006 event was also sponsored by .travel with the sponsorship money going towards the cost of organising the event. The Expedia Let Yourself Go Team were also featured on the Expedia website. The Mongolian Taxi Service team appeared on the Fifth Gear motoring program as part of a feature on the toughness of the Daihatsu Charade, inspired by their own Charade completing the rally entirely unscathed. Jack Osbourne, son of Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, took part in the 2007 rally with Amaryllis Knight,Amaryllis Knight the daughter of the former editor of The Economist and News Corporation director Andrew Knight, in a 1991 750cc Fiat Panda; their journey was aired on a television show named \\"Jack Osbourne, Mongol Rally\\". In 2009, rallier Joe Sabia created Tupac in Kazakhstan, which pieced together dozens of Kazakhs to sing Changes by Tupac Shakur. The video is the most widely watched Mongol Rally video with over a million views (June 2013).  Background  The idea later formed part of Tom Morgan's BA degree in Sculpture and was displayed at the Winchester School of Art BA Degree Show in 2003. Casualties The rally website warns against the risks of this kind of adventure. An undisclosed number of racers have been injured since 2004. In 2010 an adventurer was killed and one injured in an accident while crossing Iran.

Mithridates V was of Greek Macedonian and Persian ancestry. He was the son of the King Pharnaces I of Pontus and Queen Nysa, while his sister was Nysa of Cappadocia. His mother is believed to have died during childbirth, while giving birth to either him or his sister. He was born and raised in the Kingdom of Pontus. Mithridates V succeeded his paternal aunt Laodice and paternal uncle Mithridates IV of Pontus Justin, Epitome of Pompeius Trogus, xxxviii. 5 on the Pontian throne, but the circumstance of his accession is uncertain. Mithridates V continued the alliance with the Roman Republic started by his predecessors. He supported them with some ships and a small auxiliary force during the Third Punic War (149‚Äì146 BC)Appian, The foreign wars, Mithridatic Wars 10 and at a subsequent period rendered them useful assistance in the war against the King of Pergamon, Eumenes III (131‚Äì129 BC). For his services on this occasion, Mithridates V was rewarded by the Roman consul Manius Aquillius with the province of Phrygia. However the acts of the Roman consul were rescinded by the Roman Senate on the grounds of bribery, but it appears that he maintained his possession of Phrygia until his death.Justin, xxxvii. 1; Appian, 12, 56, 57; Orosius, Adversus Paganos, v. 10; Eutropius, Breviarium, iv. 20 Mithridates V also increased the power of the Kingdom of Pontus by the marriage of his eldest child, his daughter Laodice of Cappadocia to King Ariarathes VI of Cappadocia. The end of his reign can only be approximately determined based on statements concerning the accession of his son Mithridates VI, which is assigned to the year 120 BC, signaling the end of the reign of Mithridates V. Mithridates V was assassinated in about 120 BC in Sinope, poisoned by unknown persons at a lavish banquet which he held.Mayor, The Poison King: the life and legend of Mithradates, Rome‚Äôs deadliest enemy p.68 Mithridates V, was a great benefactor to the Hellenic culture which shows on surviving coinage and honorific inscriptions stating his donations in Athens and Delos and held the Greek God Apollo in great veneration. A bilingual inscription dedicated to him is displayed at the Capitoline Museums in Rome.Erciyas, Wealth, aristocracy and royal propaganda under the Hellenistic kingdom of the Mithradatids in the Central Black Sea Region in Turkey p.122 Mithridates V was buried in the royal tombs of his ancestors at Amasya. Mithridates V married the Greek Seleucid Princess Laodice VI, who was the daughter of Antiochus IV Epiphanes and Laodice IV.Walbank, Cambridge ancient history: The hellenistic world, Volume 7 p.491 Mithridates V and Laodice VI were related, thus he was connected to the Seleucid dynasty. Laodice bore Mithridates V eight children: Laodice of Cappadocia, Mithridates VI of Pontus, Mithridates Chrestus, Laodice, Nysa (sometimes spelt as Nyssa), Roxana and Statira. Roxana and Statira were compelled to kill themselves with poison after the fall of the Kingdom of Pontus in 63 BC. Nysa was taken prisoner by the Romans and made to march in the triumphs of two Roman generals.

The site occupies more than between 58th and 63rd Streets west of Second Avenue, on Brooklyn's western shore. The complex was originally used as a United States Army supply terminal called the Brooklyn Army Base or Brooklyn Army Supply Base. It is now used for commercial and light industrial purposes, and also serves a NYC Ferry stop. The Brooklyn Army Terminal was designed by Cass Gilbert. It contains two warehouses, three piers, several smaller administrative buildings, and rail sidings for loading cargo. When built, the warehouses were among the world's largest concrete structures. The Brooklyn Army Terminal adjoins the former Bush Terminal, which was used by the United States Navy. The Brooklyn Army Terminal's construction was originally approved in 1918, during World War I, and was completed the following year after the conclusion of the war. The terminal was subsequently leased out and used for various purposes, including as a dock, a military prison, and a storage space for drugs and alcohol during Prohibition. During World War II, the terminal was the United States' largest military supply base. The United States Army stopped using the Brooklyn Army Terminal in 1967, and the terminal was briefly used by the United States Postal Service and the Navy. The New York City government purchased the terminal in 1981, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Since then, the Brooklyn Army Terminal has undergone a series of renovations to make it suitable for commercial and light industrial use.  Description  The Brooklyn Army Terminal covers about . It includes two 8-story warehouses, three 2-story piers, several ancillary buildings, and a train storage yard with capacity for 2,200 cars. Warehouses A and B are located west of Second Avenue between 59th and 65th Streets, with warehouse A being located to the west of warehouse B. Warehouse A had a footprint of , while warehouse B measured . The 980-foot-long sides of each structure run between 58th Street on the north and 63rd Street on the south. Warehouse B was the world's largest building by floor area when it was completed. Warehouse B contains a central atrium with two railroad tracks, both of which are disused and overgrown, and there are two old train cars permanently parked on the western track of the atrium. The loading balconies in the atrium of warehouse B are staggered diagonally, and a overhead movable crane moved cargo between the balconies. Three railroad tracks ran through the space between the warehouses. An 8-story administration building measuring was located to the north of warehouse A. The warehouses and piers were connected to each other by footbridges on the third floors of each building. A footbridge also separates the former administration building from the two warehouses. There was also a power house, boiler room, and ash room. Each of the piers measured long; one of the piers was wide while the other two piers measured wide. The piers were double-decked. 58th Street, on the Brooklyn Army Terminal's northern side, separates the Army Terminal from Bush Terminal, which contains warehouses formerly used by the United States Navy. The railroad tracks connected to four car floats and a large rail yard along the western shore of Bay Ridge, to the south of Brooklyn Army Terminal. The tracks also link to the Long Island Rail Road's Bay Ridge Branch and then to the New York Connecting Railroad, which provides a railroad connection to the rest of the continental United States. The Brooklyn Army Terminal had over of tracks at its peak. Although much of the trackage was abandoned by the 1970s, including the freight yards south of the terminal, a direct track connection from the Brooklyn Army Terminal to the Bay Ridge Branch was established in 1973. Some of the tracks are still used by New York New Jersey Rail (formerly New York Cross Harbor Railroad) to carry freight along the Sunset Park shorefront. To the north, the tracks connected to Bush Terminal. Buildings A and B are operated by the New York City government as a light manufacturing space. The former administration building was remade into a food-manufacturing complex in 2017.  History  Construction = Seen from the Gowanus Expressway ramp The complex was also known as the U.S. Army Military Ocean Terminal and the Brooklyn Army Base, and was built as part of the New York Port of Embarkation. The Brooklyn Army Base was one of six United States Army terminals whose construction was approved by United States Congress on May 6, 1918, to accommodate Army activity during World War I. The base was designed by Cass Gilbert, though Irving T. Bush, who operated the adjacent Bush Terminal to the north, also helped design the complex. Construction started on May 15, 1918. The city set aside $40 million for the completion of the complex. Six thousand workers, employed by Turner Construction, helped build the Brooklyn Army Base. The scope of construction was so large that an additional train was added to subway timetables to transport workers from Manhattan to the future Army Base, and prospective workers would line up outside the construction site every morning. Several smaller contractors also helped build the complex. To save money and to reduce the use of steel, the structures were built out of reinforced poured in place concrete using wooden forms. The concrete floors were designed to support loads of . The construction process used 7 million linear feet () of wood. The Brooklyn Army Terminal was the world's largest concrete building complex at the time of construction. Ultimately, the government spent $32 million on the terminal's construction. = Military use = The Brooklyn Army Base was completed in September 1919. The base was able to accommodate of outgoing freight per hour as well as of freight storage. As World War I had already ended, this full capacity was not used for some time. However, the Brooklyn Army Base was also designed for light industrial use so that it could be used as a civilian facility after the war ended. As such, in 1920, the federal government began advertising five-year leases for parts of the base. The complex had a combined devoted to storage, which could support loads of up to . The next year, a law passed by Congress gave the United States Shipping Board access to all piers that the Army was not using. In 1923, the federal government paid $2.4 million to the estate of William C. Langley, whose plot between 61st and 63rd Streets had been seized five years earlier to make way for the Brooklyn Army Base. The same year, the Shipping Board started leasing piers 3 and 4 to private commercial tenants. The Atlantic Tidewater Terminal signed two 5-year leases for the upper floors of the warehouses, using them for storage. Under this arrangement, transatlantic liners were able to dock at the Brooklyn Army Base's piers. Starting in 1920, during Prohibition, two vaults on warehouse A's third and sixth floors were used to stock illicit alcoholic beverages, as well as narcotics. The Army installed an incinerator in 1926 so it could destroy confiscated drinks. In 1929, after a series of thefts, the U.S. Army constructed a heavily fortified vault on the seventh floor of warehouse A. Described by the Brooklyn Daily Eagle as the \\"largest vault built anywhere for the storage of dangerous drugs\\", the room measured several hundred feet in each direction. The Army also had a lab where it was able to test the chemical makeup of appropriated alcohol. Beverages deemed suitable for future medicinal use were retained, and the rest were dumped into New York Harbor. The lab was closed in 1933 after the end of Prohibition. An experimental barracks for transient service members was opened at Brooklyn Army Terminal in 1928. The barracks could accommodate 500 residents, and was designed for service members who were on leave or were awaiting discharge or transfer. By the next year, civic leaders were suggesting that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey take over the operations of the piers at Brooklyn Army Base. However, the base commander denied all rumors that the base would be abandoned or sold off. The terminal was a base for shipping to many regions during World War II, including mainland Portugal and the Azores. In March 1930, officials announced that they would construct a military prison with a 125-prisoner capacity at Brooklyn Army Base. The prison, which would be one of three Army prisons in the United States, would house deserters and servicemembers convicted of high crimes. Community members objected to the prison, stating that there had been no prior consultation with the community. Despite protests, the government decided to proceed with plans for the prison. The Brooklyn Army Terminal was the largest military supply base in the United States through World War II. The complex had its own railroad line as well as dedicated police and fire departments. According to contemporary news articles, the Brooklyn Army Base saw of cargo and was the point of departure for 3.5 million soldiers during World War II, though the Brooklyn Army Terminal's website states that the Brooklyn Army Base handled of cargo and 3.2 million soldiers.New York City Economic Development Corporation (2013). \\"Brooklyn Army Terminal: History\\" The terminal employed 20,000 workers and served as the headquarters for the New York Port of Embarkation. In mid-1941, the U.S. Army moved some civilian workers into more than at Bush Terminal, spread across three buildings along First Avenue, because there was no more space at Brooklyn Army Terminal. A rigorous safety program, enacted after the war, resulted in an 85% decrease in industrial accidents at Brooklyn Army Terminal. The base was among the safest ports of embarkation in the United States, with an average of 0.194 accidents in marine transport operations occurring per 1,000,000 man-hours; by 1947, the port had only three incidents in two years. In the aftermath of World War II, the Brooklyn Army Base received the bodies of several thousand soldiers who had died while fighting the war. The first boat carrying American World War II casualties back to the United States arrived in San Francisco in October 1947, whereupon the bodies were transported cross-country to Brooklyn Army Base. A ship carrying 4,212 soldiers' bodies traveled directly to the Brooklyn Army Terminal the next month. By July 1948, the base was receiving 18,500 soldiers' bodies within a span of two weeks. In the years after World War II ended, the Brooklyn Army Base was the port of arrival or departure for 200,000 soldiers per year. As per custom, the 328th Army Band would play every time troops arrived or departed from the base. During the late 1950s, the base received Hungarian Revolution refugees, as well as victims of a 1956 crash between the SS Andrea Doria and the MS Stockholm. In 1958, Private Elvis Presley sailed from Brooklyn Army Base to Germany alongside 1,170 other soldiers in the 3rd Armored Division. By 1963, the Brooklyn Army Terminal employed 1,800 civilians and over 200 military personnel, and another 1,600 people lived at the terminal. At that point, the terminal received of cargo every day from trucking operations, and another daily from rail operations. = Closure of military base = Seen from the New York Bay shorefront The United States Department of Defense announced in May 1964 that it was considering closing Brooklyn Army Base, as well as Fort Jay and the Brooklyn Navy Yard, as part of an effort to downsize unnecessary military installations and to save money. Immediately after the announcement, local officials and labor union leaders started advocating to save the military base from closure. Despite advocacy efforts to save the base from closure, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara announced in November 1964 that the Brooklyn Army Terminal would be one of nearly a hundred military bases that would be closed. Only the military function would be decommissioned, and 90 percent of civilian workers at Brooklyn Army Terminal would retain their jobs after the base was closed. By 1965, it was confirmed that the Brooklyn Army Terminal would close to military use on January 1, 1967. Port of Embarkation activities would be relocated to the Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne, New Jersey. Some of the base's remaining activities would be relocated to the nearby Federal Office Building at 29th Street and Third Avenue in Gowanus, Brooklyn. Officials held a decommissioning ceremony on December 9, 1966. Immediately afterward, the New York City government announced that it would acquire the terminal for maritime redevelopment. The city planned to relocate its foreign-trade zone from Staten Island to the Brooklyn Army Terminal, where there would be more room for the foreign-trade zone's operations. In addition, U.S. Senator Jacob Javits and the Brooklyn Army Terminal Development Committee discussed possible uses for the Brooklyn Army Terminal, including for the United States Post Office Department or for the Department of Defense. A dispute arose between local business owners, who wanted a large post office facility in the terminal, and the city. In June 1969, it was announced that the U.S. government would lease a section of the base to the city for two years. Afterward, the city continued to lease part of the base, and in turn, sublet the space to private companies. After a fire destroyed the Morgan General Mail Facility in Manhattan in December 1967, some of the Morgan Facility's operations were temporarily moved to the newly vacated Brooklyn Army Terminal. Soon the Brooklyn Army Terminal facility was handling 18,000 bags of international mail every day. The facility employed four thousand workers, 75% of whom lived in Brooklyn. A permanent facility to replace the Brooklyn Army Terminal operation was originally planned for Murray Hill, Manhattan, but in 1970 the planned facility was moved to Jersey City, New Jersey. In December 1970, the government announced that it was going to close the post office facility at Brooklyn Army Terminal. Shipping operations at the Brooklyn Army Terminal resumed in 1970. That same year, the federal government quietly proposed building a federal detention facility at the terminal to replace an overcrowded facility in Manhattan. The Navy moved into the terminal in 1972, and renamed it the Military Ocean Terminal. The former Brooklyn Army Base now served as the headquarters for the Military Sealift Command (MSC) Atlantic. Army shipping activities were permanently moved to Bayonne starting in 1974, saving the federal government $2 million per year. The U.S. military had completely vacated the space by October 1975. = Sale of terminal to city = Atrium of building B The United States Senate voted in August 1979 to allow the government of New York City to purchase and take over the terminal. A similar vote passed the United States House of Representatives that November. Shortly afterward, the city began tendering proposals from developers who wanted to redevelop the terminal. The city received four proposals: of these, two were for industrial redevelopment, one was for residential development, and one was for mixed-use development. In September 1980, Helmsley-Spear Inc. was selected to develop an industrial site at Brooklyn Army Terminal, in a format similar to at the nearby Bush Terminal. The federal government and the city then began discussing a purchase price for the terminal, but negotiations stalled for two months because of disagreements over sale price. By December, the federal government agreed to sell the terminal for $8.5 million; roughly half of the cost, or $4 million, would be paid by the city, while the remaining balance would be paid by the United States Economic Development Administration. The federal government withheld aid for another several months, but finally approved the $4.5 million grant in April 1981. The two sides finalized the sale in July 1981. In September of that year, Helmsley- Spear Inc. CEO Harry Helmsley announced that he was withdrawing the company from a tentative deal to sublet the Brooklyn Army Terminal from the city. The withdrawal came after a disagreement over the lease terms; the city had proposed new terms in which it would receive a greater share of the profits from subleasing the terminal to industrial tenants. By 1983, the city had hired Eastdil Realty, which was arranging for $20 million to rehabilitate the first building in the complex. Most of the $20 million would come from private sources, but the city would pledge $2 million and was awaiting another $5.6 million of federal Urban Development Action Grants. The city projected that a full renovation of the Brooklyn Army Terminal would take four years and cost $36 million. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The listing includes 11 contributing buildings on an area of . and Accompanying 22 photos and Accompanying photo captions =Use as manufacturing hub= The city government began completely renovating building B's northern half in 1985, adding of new leasable space. As part of the renovations, the city installed electrical, plumbing, and heating infrastructure; replaced the elevators; added restrooms; landscaped and cleaned up the building's exterior; added a parking lot; and improved the loading docks. The first phase consisted of 32 units of industrial space, which each had an average of of space. The renovations cost approximately $33 million. After the renovations were complete, the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) started leasing the property as a center for dozens of light manufacturing, warehousing and back-office businesses, with rents averaging $3.75 per square foot. The first industrial tenants signed leases for space in the terminal in May 1987. By August 1988, sixty percent of the available space had been leased, rising to eighty percent by December. All of the available space had been leased by October 1989. The Bibby Venture, one of the two first prison barges to be brought to New York City, was purchased and docked on the East River in summer 1988 as a result of overcrowding in the city's jails. However, by August 1988, it was moved to outside Brooklyn Army Terminal. Its location outside the terminal was a temporary measure, necessitated because residents of neighborhoods along the East River objected to the barge's presence. As originally planned, the barge would be moved to Pier 40 on the West Side of Manhattan by early 1989. While docked at Brooklyn Army Terminal, the Bibby Venture was used to house prisoners awaiting trial. However, residents of Sunset Park and Bay Ridge also objected to the prison barge, saying that they had not been consulted about the decision. The Bibby Venture was moved to Pier 40 on the Hudson River in summer 1989. The Bibby Venture and its sister barge Bibby Resolution were retired from use in 1992, to be replaced by the Vernon C. Bain Correctional Center floating jail in the South Bronx, and the barges were sold two years later. By late 1988, the city was planning to renovate another million square feet at a cost of $44.5 million. During the renovation, the city would add 40 industrial units with an average of of floor space in each unit, as well as of retail space. The city started signing leases for the space in 1990, just after construction on the second phase started. Renovations also started on parts of Building A, and work on a space in the building was completed in 1994. Upgrades to an additional of space were completed in 1995. A fourth phase of renovations was completed by 2003, adding another . By that time, of space had been renovated. The city began offering public tours of Brooklyn Army Terminal's interior in 2013. The tours, offered two weekends a month, were offered through Turnstile Tours. Two years later, the city started a $100 million rehabilitation of in Building A. This stage's high costs were attributed to asbestos abatement and other cleanup. The NYCEDC also started renovating the Administration Building into a food-manufacturing complex at a cost of $15 million. The renovations also included the restoration of of outdoor space, based on a design by WXY Architecture and Urban Design. By 2016, there were 3,700 people working in Brooklyn Army Terminal, with a thousand more jobs planned over the following ten years. The administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio set up a job center at Brooklyn Army Terminal to help local residents with limited English proficiency obtain jobs at the terminal. NYC Ferry started operating to Brooklyn Army Terminal in May 2017. The terminal's food manufacturing complex opened that June. The renovation of the 500,000-square-foot space in Building A was completed in June 2018, just after the 100th anniversary of when construction started on the terminal. The refurbished area could accommodate an additional 20 companies. By this time, the renovation of the terminal was 92% complete. The Brooklyn Army Terminal had 100 companies that collectively employed 3,800 workers, but the city projected that an additional 1,000 jobs would be added once leases were granted for all of the newly renovated space. Because of the decline of traditional manufacturing in Brooklyn, most of the new tenants were companies that worked in the technology, media, food, or manufacturing sectors, while the city had stopped renewing leases for tenants that primarily worked in distribution and storage. The total cost of restoring the complex was projected to be $280 million by 2016, a cost that had risen to $300 million in 2018.  Transportation  The piers at Brooklyn Army Terminal are used by NYC Ferry's Rockaway and South Brooklyn routes. MTA Regional Bus Operations' B9 route stops outside Brooklyn Army Terminal, while the B37 route stops along Third Avenue, close to the terminal. The nearest New York City Subway station is at 59th Street and Fourth Avenue, served by the . = Ferry service = NYC Ferry stop at Brooklyn Army Terminal A fast ferry service from Brooklyn Army Terminal to Manhattan was first proposed in 1994 as a way to revitalize Sunset Park. The boat service was expected to start service in 1997 at a cost of $25 million, and would include a new pier at 59th Street as well as a 500-space parking lot at Brooklyn Army Terminal. This ferry service was operating by late 1997, bringing increased economic activity to the Brooklyn Army Terminal area as a result. After subway service in Lower Manhattan was disrupted following the September 11, 2001, attacks, the city established a free ferry service from the Brooklyn Army Terminal's 58th Street Pier to Pier 11/Wall Street, using funds provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. New York Water Taxi took over the route in 2003 and instituted a fare.* * In 2008, New York Water Taxi established a route between Pier 11 and Breezy Point, Queens, with a stop at Brooklyn Army Terminal. This service was indefinitely suspended in 2010 due to lack of funding. In the aftermath of subway disruptions arising from Hurricane Sandy on October 29, 2012, SeaStreak began running a route from Rockaway Park, Queens, to Pier 11 and the East 34th Street ferry terminal. The ferry route charged a $2 fare for each passenger. A stop at Brooklyn Army Terminal was added to those trips in August 2013, following the closure of the Montague Street subway tunnel, which suspended direct service on the R train between Brooklyn and Manhattan. The ferry service proved to be popular with locals; about 250 passengers per day rode the ferry between Brooklyn Army Terminal and Manhattan, in addition to approximately 730 daily passengers riding the ferry between Rockaway and Manhattan. The ferry route carried nearly 200,000 passengers between its inception and mid-2014. The route was renewed several times through mid-2014, but was discontinued on October 31, 2014 because of a lack of funding. On May 1, 2017, NYC Ferry's Rockaway route started operating between Pier 11/Wall Street in Manhattan's Financial District and Beach 108th Street in Rockaway Park, with a stop at Brooklyn Army Terminal. The terminal is also served by NYC Ferry's South Brooklyn route, which started running on June 1, 2017.

The nearest large town is Southend, which is approximately four miles to the west. Public transport to the village is via a bus service from Southend, and the village is well served with several historic public houses, a primary school, a Co-Operative supermarket, post office, hairdresser's and several small and characterful village shops. Great Wakering consists mainly of two roads: the High Street, which runs from the junction of Star Lane, and New Road, which begins outside St. Nicholas' Parish Church and runs down to the bridges for Foulness Island. History According to a medieval tradition, Wakering (probably Great Wakering) was the site of a monastery during the seventh century AD. Two Christian cousins of King Ecgberht of Kent, named Aethelred and Aethelberht, were murdered at Eastry, a royal dwelling in the Kingdom of Kent, during King Ecgberht's reign (664‚Äì673). They were prevented by a miracle from being buried at Canterbury, and were taken instead to an existing monastery at Wakering in the Kingdom of Essex and enshrined there as saints. Ecgberht's brother and successor, King Hlothhere of Kent, is said by William of Malmesbury to have ridiculed the idea of their sanctity. The village church, dedicated to St. Nicholas, dates back to Norman times and the board of rectors or vicars inside begins in the year 1200 with simply \\"Robert\\", and the next incumbent equally simply named \\"Peter\\". As well as the parish church, the village also has a United Reformed Church in Chapel Lane, a Methodist church, and an Evangelical (formerly Peculiar People) church on Great Wakering High Street. Great Wakering is a village steeped in history. It has many community links to the Ministry of Defence-governed Foulness Island. The village was badly hit during the 1953 floods and locals fear a re-occurrence of the devastation now that tidal levels are rising and flood defences eroding. Of architectural interest is an old brickworks site (now partly demolished) at Star Lane, which was once served by an industrial narrow-gauge railway, the remains of which can still be seen in the bushes if you look carefully. Brick-making was once the main industry in Wakering. The factory finally closed in 1991, but the four towers remained a focal point on the horizon until September 2007, when the towers were finally demolished. Currently, there is building work for new housing on the site. Much of the land area around Great Wakering is closed to the public as it forms part of a Ministry of Defence (MOD) firing range ‚Äì the \\"New Ranges\\". When firing is not taking place, however, the MOD beach at Wakering Stairs can be accessed via a rough road at Landwick security check-in. You can also cross MOD land and walk across the range from Cupid's Corner to follow a muddy track to the seawall which offers great views over the Maplin Sands. The MOD beach is a great spot for watching Brent geese and waders. You will find much military debris around the area such as old firing targets, railway tracks, a lookout tower and several ruined batteries. There is also access here to the tidal path The Broomway, which leads to Fisherman's Head on Foulness Island. Sport and leisure The local football team Great Wakering Rovers play in the Isthmian League First Division North. Their home ground, Burroughs Park. Fairfax Saxons FC are a Great Wakering based football club set up to raise awareness of men‚Äôs health and to promote the community and local businesses via the medium of football. They play in the Southend Borough Combination Veterans League. This covers the Southend and surrounding areas. Home games are played at The Wakering Recreation Ground. It is a Sunday League set up. As a club, they train every Tuesday and on Sunday when there is no game on. They are always welcoming new players and we hope to expand to create more teams within the club.

Family background Baroness von Kr√ºdener was born in Riga, Governorate of Livonia. Her father, Baron Otto Hermann von Vietinghoff genannt Scheel, who had fought as a colonel in Catherine II's wars, was one of the two councillors for Livonia and a man of immense wealth. He was a man of rationalistic views and a leading freemason. Her mother, the Countess Anna Ulrika von M√ºnnich, was a granddaughter of Burkhard Christoph von M√ºnnich, a celebrated Russian field marshal, and a strict Lutheran. Barbe-Julie de Vietinghoff, better known as Madame von Kr√ºdener (Mme. de Kr√ºdener) later in life, but, as a child, referred to as Juliana, was one of five children born into the wealthy Vietinghoff family. =Father= Her father, Otto Hermann von Vietinghoff-Scheel, had started accruing his wealth from a young age, for as a young man, he proved to possess a knack for business. With his high ambitions, he entered into commercial enterprises that became highly successful. Some of his treasures included grand properties in Kosse (present-day Viitina, Estonia) and Marienburg, as well as his grandiose townhouse in Riga, where Barbe-Julie was born. Although he was never assigned an official title, he enjoyed the official rank as a privy counselor and as a senator and \\"would exclaim with pride 'I am Vietinghoff', and behave with all the arrogance of a great noble\\". =Mother= Barbe-Julie's mother, Anna Ulrika von M√ºnnich von Vietinghoff-Scheel, was herself born into nobility. Her grandfather, the famed Field Marshal Burkhard Christoph von M√ºnnich, despite having been exiled for many years in Siberia, had led many successful campaigns against the Tartars and the Turks. Catherine II also made him one of her favorites, although, sometimes the status was fickle. Mme. de Vietinghoff mirrored her grandfather's success in her own household, as a mother of five (she bore two sons and three daughters), she was extremely dedicated, despite the death in infancy of her first son, and her physically handicapped eldest daughter (who was both mute and deaf, and whom the family eventually placed in an asylum in 1777). Education Her education, according to her own account, consisted of lessons in French spelling, deportment and sewing. At an early age, Barbe- Julie began learning French and German. The former allowed her access to the writings of the great philosophers, such as Voltaire and the Encyclopedists. It also gave her access to French culture, which her parents, along with other nobles, attempted to emulate and imitate. The importance of French ideals and culture seem to have replaced a need for religious studies, and because both of her parents were of German background. In spite of the quotation given (\\"it still remains unclear as to whether or not the Vietinghoff family were of Orthodox or Lutheran faith\\") the Vietinghoff family certainly was of Lutheran faith. Marriage Arms of the Kruedener Family Although Barbe-Julie \\"was still an overgrown, undeveloped, silent girl, with a rather large nose and an uncertain complexion, [she possessed] ample promises of future beauty in her big blue eyes and curling chestnut hair, and in her singularly well-shaped hands and arms\\". Her potential beauty, combined with her being the heir to her parents‚Äô wealth, resulted in an onslaught of marriage proposals. Her parents arranged for her to be married to the local neighborhood baron despite Barbe- Julie's incessant protesting. Seeing no way out of her situation, the young baroness first starting conversing with God. She begged him to save her from this horrid situation. He answered her with a case of the measles that left her less attractive (at least temporarily), which became at least a part of the baron's incentive to politely decline the marriage proposal. As a result, Barbe-Julie began to believe that she personally had a divine connection with God. However, when Baron Burkhardt-Alexis-Constantine Kr√ºdener, a widower sixteen years her senior, sought her hand, she had no such qualms. He was a well-educated (he attending the University of Leipzig), and a well-traveled man, who, like her father, was in favour with Catherine II. However, the baron, a diplomatist of distinction, was cold and reserved, while Barbe-Julie was frivolous, pleasure-loving, and possessed of an insatiable thirst for attention and flattery; and the strained relations due to this incompatibility of temper were made worse by her limitless extravagance, which constantly involved the young baroness and her husband in financial difficulties. At first all went well. This was due to the fact that despite having an older husband for whom she did not possess any passionate feelings, his title and position in society were such that he could provide her whatever she might desire. At the same time she endowed him with an even higher social status because of the social standing of her own family. However, this socially advantageous exchange left, for the baroness, much to be desired. Despite being materially pleased she was romantically unsatisfied. Her \\"earliest griefs arose from the fact, that, in her youthful inexperience, having chosen with her head, she expected at the same time to satisfy the longings of a singularly romantic heart\\". First she would pretend that her husband was something that he was not: a lover. This is especially evident in her description of him in her book. \\"The glowing description of the Count in Val√©rie represents Baron Kr√ºdener more as his wife‚Äôs ardent imagination loved to picture him, than as he really was. The truth is, he did not lend himself readily to the role of a hero of romance\\". These notions, as well as the separation between her real husband and her fictional husband helped lead to marital instability and to the eventual love affairs she had with others. On January 31, 1784 a son was born to them, named Paul after the grand-duke Paul (afterwards emperor), who acted as god-father. The same year Baron Kr√ºdener became ambassador at Venice, later (1786) at Munich where he remained until transferred to Copenhagen in 1787. In 1787 the birth of a daughter (Juliette) aggravated the nervous disorders from which the baroness had for some time been suffering, and it was decided that she must go to the south for her health; she accordingly left, with her infant daughter and her stepdaughter Sophie. In 1789 she was at Paris when the Estates General met; a year later, at Montpellier, she met a young cavalry captain, Charles Louis de Fr√©geville, and a passionate attachment sprang up between them. They returned together to Copenhagen, where the baroness told her husband that her heart could no longer be his. The baron was coldly kind; he refused to hear of a divorce and attempted to arrange a modus vivendi, which was facilitated by the departure of de Fr√©geville for the war. All was useless; Juliana refused to remain at Copenhagen, and, setting out on her travels, visited Riga, St. Petersburg ‚Äî where her father had become a senator of BerlinHe died while she was there in 1792. ‚Äî Leipzig and Switzerland. In 1794 her husband became ambassador at Madrid. In 1800 her husband became ambassador at Berlin, and she joined him there. But the stiff court society of Prussia was irksome to her; money difficulties continued; and by way of climax, the murder of the Tsar Paul, in whose favour Baron Kr√ºdener had stood high, made the position of the ambassador extremely precarious. The baroness seized the occasion to leave for the baths of Teplitz, whence she wrote to her husband that the doctors had ordered her to winter in the south. He died on June 14, 1802, without ever having seen her again. Religious development Towards the end of the Napoleonic wars religious thought was in tune with the general disillusionment with the ideals of the French Revolution, and thus a search for an alternative. She had an influence on the Swiss R√©veil, and for a time her ideas had a profound effect on Alexander I of Russia. Through her contact with the Russian Emperor she and Henri-Louis Empaytaz, a member of the R√©veil, were in part responsible for the religious aspects of the Holy Alliance. Meanwhile, the baroness had been revelling in the intellectual society of Coppet and of Paris. She was now thirty-six; her charms were fading, but her passion for admiration survived. She had tried the effect of the shawl dance, in imitation of Emma, Lady Hamilton; she now sought fame in literature, and in 1803, after consulting Chateaubriand and other writers of distinction, published her Val√©rie, a sentimental romance, of which under a thin veil of anonymity she herself was the heroine. In January 1804 she returned to Riga, Livonia. At Riga occurred her conversion. A gentleman of her acquaintance when about to salute her fell dying at her feet. The shock overset her not too well balanced mind; she sought for consolation, and found it in the ministrations of her shoemaker, an ardent disciple of the Moravian Brethren. Though she had \\"found peace\\", however, the disorder of her nerves continued and she was ordered by her doctor to the baths of Wiesbaden. At K√∂nigsberg she had an interview with Queen Louise, and, more important still, with one Adam M√ºller, a rough peasant, to whom God had supposedly revealed a prophetic mission to King Frederick William III. Chiliasm was in the air. Napoleon was evidently Antichrist; and the latter days were about to be accomplished. Under the influence of the pietistic movement the belief was widely spread, in royal courts, in country parsonages, in peasant novels: a man would be raised up from the north from the rising of the sun (Isa. xli. 25); Antichrist would be overthrown, and Christ would come to reign a thousand years upon the earth. The interview determined the direction of the baroness's religious development. A short visit to the Moravians at Herrnhut followed; then she went, via Dresden, to Karlsruhe, to sit at the feet of Heinrich Jung-Stilling who had great influence at the court of Baden and Stockholm and St. Petersburg.The consorts of Alexander I of Russia (Elizabeth Alexeievna), and of Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden (Friederike Dorothea), were princesses of Baden. By him she was instructed in the chiliastic faith and in the mysteries of the supernatural world. Then, hearing that a certain pastor in the Vosges, Jean Fr√©d√©ric Fontaines, was prophesying and working miracles, she determined to go to him. On June 5, 1801, accordingly, she arrived at the Protestant parsonage of Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines, accompanied by her daughter Juliette, her stepdaughter Sophie and a Russian valet. This remained for two years her headquarters. Fontaines, half-charlatan, half-dupe, had introduced into his household a prophetess named Marie Gottliebin KummerShe had been condemned some years previously in W√ºrttemberg to the pillory and three years imprisonment as a swindler (Betr√ºgerin), on her own confession. Her curious history is given in detail by M. Muhlenbeck. whose visions, carefully calculated for her own purposes, became the oracle of the divine mysteries for the baroness. Under this influence she believed more firmly than ever in the approaching millennium and her own mission to proclaim it. Her rank, her reckless charities, and her exuberant eloquence produced a great effect on the simple country folk; and when, in 1809, it was decided to found a colony of the elect in order to wait for the coming of the Lord, many wretched peasants sold or distributed all they possessed and followed the baroness and Fontaines into W√ºrttemberg, where the settlement was established at Catharinenplaisir and the ch√¢teau of Bonnigheim, only to be dispersed (May 1) by an unsympathetic government.In 1809 it was obviously inconvenient to have people proclaiming Napoleon as \\"the Beast\\". Further wanderings followed: to Lichtenthal near Baden; to Karlsruhe and the congenial society of pietistic princesses; to Riga, where she was present at the deathbed of her mother (January 24, 1811); then back to Karlsruhe. The influence of Fontaines, to whom she had been \\"spiritually married\\" (Madame Fontaines being content with the part of Martha in the household, so long as the baroness's funds lasted), had now waned, and she had fallen under that of Johann Kaspar Wegelin (1766‚Äì1833), a pious linen-draper of Strasbourg, who taught her the sweetness of complete annihilation of the will and mystic death. Her preaching and her indiscriminate charities now began to attract curious crowds from afar; and her appearance everywhere was accompanied by an epidemic of visions and prophesyings, which culminated in the appearance in 1811 of the comet, a sure sign of the approaching end. In 1812 she was at Strassburg, whence she paid more than one visit to J. F. Oberlin, the famous pastor of Waldersbach in Steintal (Ban de la Roche), and where she had the glory of converting her host, Adrien de Lazay-Marnesia, the prefect. In 1813 she was at Geneva, where she established the faith of a band of young pietists in revolt against the Calvinist Church authorities notably Henri-Louis Empaytaz, afterwards the companion of her crowning evangelistic triumph. In September 1814 she was again at Waldbach, where Empaytaz had preceded her; and at Strassburg, where the party was joined by Franz Karl von Berckheim, who afterwards married Juliette.Berckheim had been French commissioner of police in Mainz and had abandoned his post in 1813. At the end of the year she returned with her daughters and Empeytaz to Baden, a fateful migration. The empress Elizabeth of Russia was now at Karlsruhe; and she and the pietist ladies of her entourage hoped that the emperor Alexander might find at the hands of Madame de Kr√ºdener the peace which an interview with Jung-Stilling had failed to bring him. The baroness herself wrote urgent letters to Roxandre de Stourdza, sister of Alexandre Stourdza the tsar's Romanian secretary, begging her to procure an interview. There seemed to be no result; but the correspondence paved the way for the opportunity which a strange chance was to give her of realizing her ambition. Association with Tsar Alexander In the spring of 1815 the baroness was settled at Schl√ºchtern, a Baden enclave in W√ºrttemberg, busy persuading the peasants to sell all and fly from the wrath to come. Near this, at Heilbronn, the emperor Alexander established his headquarters on June 4. That very night the baroness sought and obtained an interview. To the tsar, who had been brooding alone over an open Bible, her sudden arrival seemed an answer to his prayers; for three hours the prophetess preached her strange gospel, while the most powerful man in Europe sat, his face buried in his hands, sobbing like a child; until at last he declared that he had \\"found peace\\". At the tsar's request she followed him to Heidelberg and later to Paris, where she was lodged at the Hotel Montchenu, next door to the imperial headquarters in the √âlys√©e Palace. A private door connected the establishments, and every evening the emperor went to take part in the prayer- meetings conducted by the baroness and Empeytaz. Chiliasm seemed to have found an entrance into the high councils of Europe, and the baroness von Kr√ºdener had become a political force to be reckoned with. Admission to her religious gatherings was sought by a crowd of people celebrated in the intellectual and social world; Chateaubriand came, and Benjamin Constant, Madame Recamier, the duchesse de Bourbon, and Madame de Duras. The fame of the wonderful conversion, moreover, attracted other members of the chilastic fraternity, among them Fontaines, who brought with him the prophetess Marie Kummer. In this religious forcing-house the idea of the Holy Alliance germinated and grew to rapid maturity. On September 26 the portentous proclamation, which was to herald the opening of a new age of peace and goodwill on earth, was signed by the sovereigns of Russia, Austria and Prussia. Its authorship has ever been a matter of dispute. Madame de Kr√ºdener herself claimed that she had suggested the idea, and that Alexander had submitted the draft for her approval. This is probably correct, though the tsar later, when he had recovered his mental equilibrium, reproved her for her indiscretion in talking of the matter. His eyes, indeed, had begun to be opened before he left Paris, and Marie Kummer was the unintentional cause. At the very first s√©ance the prophetess, whose revelations had been praised by the baroness in extravagant terms, had the evil inspiration to announce in her trance to the emperor that it was God's will that he should endow the religious colony to which she belonged! Alexander merely remarked that he had received too many such revelations before to be impressed. The baroness's influence was shaken but not destroyed, and before he left Paris Alexander gave her a passport to Russia. She was not to see him again. She left Paris on October 22, 1815, intending to travel to St. Petersburg by way of Switzerland. The tsar, however, offended by her indiscretions and sensible of the ridicule which his relations with her had brought upon him, showed little disposition to hurry her arrival. She remained in Switzerland, where she presently fell under the influence of an unscrupulous adventurer named J. G. Kellner. For months Empeytaz, an honest enthusiast, struggled to save her from this man's clutches but in vain. Kellner too well knew how to flatter the baroness's inordinate vanity: the author of the Holy Alliance could be none other than the \\"woman clothed with the sun\\" from the Book of Revelation.Revelation xii 1. She wandered with Kellner from place to place, proclaiming her mission, working miracles, persuading her converts to sell all and follow her. Crowds of beggars and rapscallions of every description gathered wherever she went, supported by the charities squandered from the common fund. She became a nuisance to the authorities and a menace to the peace; W√ºrttemberg had expelled her, and the example was followed by every Swiss canton she entered in turn. At last, in May 1818, she set out for her estate in Kosse, Livonia (now Viitina, Estonia), accompanied by Kellner and a remnant of the elect. The emperor Alexander having opened the Crimea to German and Swiss chiliasts in search of a land of promise, the baroness's son-in-law Berckheim and his wife now went there to help establish the new colonies. In November 1820 the baroness at last went herself to St. Petersburg, where Berckheim was lying ill. She was there when the news arrived of Ypsilanti's invasion of the Danubian principalities, which opened the Greek War of Independence. She at once proclaimed the divine mission of the Tsar to take up arms on behalf of Christendom. Alexander, however, had long since exchanged her influence for that of Metternich, and he was far from anxious to be forced into even a holy war. To the baroness's overtures he replied in a long and polite letter, the gist of which was that she must leave St. Petersburg at once. In 1823 the death of Kellner, whom to the last she regarded as a saint, was a severe blow to her. Her health was failing, but she allowed herself to be persuaded by Princess Galitzine to accompany her to the Crimea, where she had established a Swiss colony. Here, at Karasubazar, she died on December 25, 1824.

It is their final direct-to-video production. Plot Twin sisters, Shane (Mary-Kate Olsen) and Elizabeth Dalton (Ashley Olsen), live separately from one another on opposite ends of the country after their parents divorced years earlier. Shane, who lives with their mom in Los Angeles, is a chilled out, tree-hugging vegetarian who is very into nature and spiritual beliefs, while her estranged sister Lizzie, who lives with their dad in Washington D.C, is a level-headed grade A student with a driven personality. However, unknown to each other, they both apply to be contestants on a reality game show filmed in Mexico called The Challenge, which tests contestants strength and survival skills in various challenges as they work as part of a team in order to win college scholarships. Marcus, (Brian Skala), the head intern at \\"The Challenge\\", informs the show's producer, Max (Joe Michael Burke), of their distant relationship. Knowing they dislike each other, Marcus puts both girls on the same team, Team Mayan, as part of a scheme to boost the show's ratings. Backstage, Shane meets and becomes close to Adam (Lukas Behnken), a laid-back jock who is put on the opposite team, Team Aztec. Team Aztec also includes Kelly (Sarah Bastian), an overly-competitive swimmer, JJ (Diana Carreno), a ditzy \\"triple threat\\" with dreams of stardom, and Charles (Ty Hodges), a calm and intuitive city boy who plans to study psychotherapy. Along with Shane and Lizzie, Team Mayan also includes Anthony (Theo Rossi), an Italian-American food enthusiast, and Justin (Zakk Moore), a surfer and skater from sunny Florida. At their first meeting, Max informs the group of the rules, which include a prohibition on romantic entanglements between contestants, as it can result in disqualification from a challenge. During the first challenge, Shane and Lizzie's bickering prevents them from working together, and Team Aztec wins the points. When Anthony and Justin make them realize that they'll need to pull together, they start putting aside their differences for the sake of the team. Over the first few days, Shane and Adam become more and more close, and Kelly suspects something is going on. At the same time, Lizzie starts hanging out behind the scenes with Marcus, although he is still being asked by Max to spy on the girls. Marcus finds out that Shane hates heights and that Lizzie is afraid of snakes, information which Max plans to use later on. Team Mayan win the fourth and fifth challenges, making the score 3-2 to Team Aztec, and Shane and Lizzie both start to respect what the other knows. One night, the girls sneak out to meet Marcus and Adam; but they're followed by Max who fails to get video footage of their meeting However, Kelly manages to take a picture of Adam and Shane kissing and shows it to Max. He disqualifies both of them from the next round, which Team Mayan eventually win, tying the score of the teams involved in \\"The Challenge\\". Team Mayan is given a boat party as reward for their victory, which Team Aztec have to cater for in costume. At the party, Marcus tells Lizzie that he's been behind Max's troublemaking, and she dumps him. Later on, Shane and Lizzie manage to patch things up with each other for good after realizing that they're not all that different from each other. The final challenge will decide the winners of \\"The Challenge\\". It is an assault course featuring various challenges including walking harnessed on a bridge high over a canyon (incorporating knowledge about Shane's established fear) and then walking on narrow planks over a pit of snakes (reflecting Max's knowledge of Lizzie's fear). The girls help each other out and Team Mayan reaches the totem before the others, making them the winners. All all of the contestants receive college scholarships. With the experience coming to a close, Kelly apologies for the mistakes, Lizzie makes up with Marcus, and then the girls retaliate against Max by tipping slime on him while taking a picture. The Challenge was Mary-Kate and Ashley's last direct to video production, so in a short scene at the end of the movie, some of the twins' boyfriends from past movies and TV-shows show up and begin arguing over who the girls loved more. This leads to the girls leaving together while saying, \\"Boys may come and go, but we'll always have each other‚Äîand that's not just in the movies.\\" The Contestants Shane Dalton (Mary-Kate Olsen): A laid-back vegetarian who lives with her mother in California; she's Lizzie's twin. Very peaceful and Zen-empowered, Shane uses yoga and pilates to find peace with the world. She is afraid of heights. She wants to be an earth scientist. Elizabeth \\"Lizzie\\" Dalton (Ashley Olsen): A modern city girl living with her father in Washington DC. The more uptight twin. She is very detailed-oriented, which proves to be a bit of an advantage during later tasks in the game. She has a fear of snakes. Adam (Lukas Behnken): An easy-going, average boy who plans to go to college to study journalism. He grows close to Shane early on the film. Like Shane and Lizzie's parents, Adam's parents are divorced. Kelly (Sarah Bastian credited as Sera Bastain): A very athletic, overly-competitive girl from Knoxville, Tennessee. She is seen to have a special talent for swimming, but her competitiveness makes her come off a bit anti-social and a bit antagonistic of not only the other team but her own team. Anthony (Theo Rossi): An Italian-American boy who plans to use his winnings to go to culinary school. His goal is to be like Emeril Lagasse, and he is very fond of eating as well as cooking. He is implied to be a second-generation Italian- American, as during one scene, when he thinks he sees his mother, she is depicted as having a heavy Italian accent. Anthony becomes best friends with Justin. Justin (Zakk Moore): A typical 'surfer dude' from Orlando. Though he seems to be nothing but a fun-loving skater-boy from the start, he is depicted as having a very high IQ; he plans to study astrophysics and can easily answer questions during one task pertaining to pharmaceutical chemistry. JJ (Diana Carreno): A self-proclaimed \\"triple-threat\\" with dreams of stardom. Slightly ditzy and living in her own bubble. It's hinted that she may not be very intelligent as she initially thought she was auditioning for American Idol. In the end, she receives an invitation to be on the show. Charles (Ty Hodges credited as Eric Ty Hodges): A very calm, intuitive boy who plans to study psychotherapy. He is the one who tries to keep his team calm and ensure they are mentally focused. He also makes several efforts to bring Kelly back down to Earth when she lets her competitiveness get the best of her. The Crew * Max (Joe Michael Burke): The arrogant, fame-hungry host of \\"The Challenge\\" who will do anything to get ratings. * Sasha (Jeannette Weegar credited as Jeanette Weegar): Max's redheaded assistant who only appears in a few scenes. * Big Joe (Pablo Recasens): Max's right hand man and camera man. * Marcus (Brian Skala): The head intern at The Challenge; he turns out to be the only intern there. He's from L.A and wants to direct films in his future.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on April 18, 1999. The episode follows Peter after he tries to make amends for his son, Stewie's, first birthday party when he loses their reservation at a popular kids' restaurant known as Cheesie Charlie's. Meanwhile, Meg becomes friends with an excitable girl named Jennifer, who leads her to join a death cult, in an attempt to fit in. The episode was written by Danny Smith and directed by Dominic Polcino, both firsts in the Family Guy series. The episode featured guest performances by Butch Hartman, Waylon Jennings, Rachael MacFarlane and John O'Hurley, along with several recurring voice actors for the series. Much of the episode features a cutaway style of humor that is typically used in Family Guy, many of which feature cultural references including the Incredible Hulk, The Dukes of Hazzard, Three Little Pigs, and Couplehood. The title \\"Chitty Chitty Death Bang\\" is a variation on that of the 1968 musical film, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Plot Lois has booked Cheesie Charlie's for Stewie's upcoming first birthday party and sends Peter, along with Chris, to drop off the deposit check at the restaurant. However, once they arrive, they seek the opportunity to play with all the machines, causing Peter to lose his watch in a claw machine. A little boy wins his watch, which causes Peter to become angry and tries to force the watch off the child. Five minutes later, the manager sees this and asks Peter to leave. But once Peter shows the deposit check, he immediately apologizes and exclaims how they are very excited to host Stewie's birthday party. Peter, angered by how he was treated, states that they will not be celebrating Stewie's party there, which causes a crowd of people to circle around the manager shouting for the reservation. Peter, realizing what he has just done, immediately returns home with a poorly crafted lie in an attempt to evade Lois' aggravation which involves him saying that they are Nazis who torture, kill and kidnap people. He pretends that he is already planned an extravagant party at home so that Lois does not have do any work. Meanwhile, Stewie misinterprets the meaning of his birthday and assumes that the same mysterious \\"Man in White\\" who delivered him as an infant will be returning to force Stewie back into Lois' womb from which he escaped just one year ago. Meg cries all the way home to Peter from cheerleading practice, and has been having trouble fitting in at school. Later, she discovers a new friend named Jennifer. Meanwhile, Stewie makes it all the way to the airport looking for tickets but then is stopped by a member of staff. The man then gives Stewie some advice saying that running from your problems never solves anything. Stewie then reflects on this, deciding to finally face \\"The Man in White\\". But before he leaves, he wishes the man luck before freezing him in carbonite. Peter tries desperately, but ultimately unsuccessfully, to put together a party in time for Stewie's birthday. He finally reroutes a circus into the Griffins' backyard, saving the day - that is, until he reveals to Lois that he gave Meg permission to go to a party at her friend's house. Lois, who wanted the whole family together for Stewie's party, is upset with Peter for letting Meg go. What Peter and Lois do not realize is that Meg's \\"party\\" is actually a cult meeting where all the members are about to commit group suicide. Peter goes to retrieve Meg from her \\"party\\" and asks Meg to come as Lois wants her there. Meg just says it is just a birthday party and asks who would remember if she was not there. Peter says that Lois would as she remembers everything and that her best memories are of when Meg and her brothers were born. He then has an epiphany: having the entire family at the party is more for Lois than Stewie. Realizing how terrible she has been, Meg agrees to come home and the cult members agree as well. Peter makes a toast, then looks at his watch before he can drink the poisoned punch and pulls Meg out before she can drink hers, oblivious to the fact that he is saving her life in the process while the cult members all die. The cult leader chases after them while wearing his ceremonial white robe and is mistaken by Stewie as \\"The Man in White.\\" Stewie does away with him and, feeling victorious, joins the others to enjoy his party. Production This was the first episode to include show creator Seth MacFarlane's sister Rachael MacFarlane as a guest voice actress. \\"Chitty Chitty Death Bang\\" was written by Danny Smith and directed by Dominic Polcino, both their first episodes in the Family Guy series. Staff writers included voice actor Mike Henry and Andrew Gormley, while Ricky Blitt, Chris Sheridan as executive story editors, and Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan acted as the story editors. To help Polcino direct the episode were supervising directors Peter Shin and Roy Allen Smith. In addition to the regular cast, guest stars included actor and comedian Patrick Bristow, animator, executive producer, animation director, storyboard artist and producer Butch Hartman (who played Mr. Weed, Peter's boss, and various other characters), writer Gary Janetti (who played the Demon and Riff), actor John O'Hurley (who played the Cult Leader), and Waylon Jennings (who played himself). Recurring cast members included Mike Henry who played Cleveland Brown and Lori Alan who played Dianne Simons. This is the first episode Seth MacFarlane's sister, Rachael MacFarlane guest starred in the episode as the voice of Jennifer. In future episodes she would become a recurring voice actor for the series. Rachel has noted that she was asked by Seth to lend her voice for the show, but she did have to audition for the role. As with the remaining first four episodes of the season, the title of the episode, \\"Chitty Chitty Death Bang\\", was derived from 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology \\"Suspense\\", which featured several elements pertaining to death and murder. This convention was later dropped following the fifth episode of the season, \\"A Hero Sits Next Door\\". due to individual episodes becoming difficult to identify and distinguish.Callaghan, p. 32 Cultural references When Peter explains to Lois why he canceled the party at Cheesie Charlie's, he said he had been kidnapped by them and that they are Nazis. He explains to Lois that he escaped by turning into the Incredible Hulk. The place where Lois had planned Stewie's birthday party is called Cheesie Charlie's, which is a reference to the food chain Chuck E. Cheese's. When Stewie recalls how he was conceived he tells the story of which he was in a sperm ship and gets into a fight with other sperm ships is a reference to fights in the Star Wars trilogy. Peter loses his Dukes of Hazzard watch. When Peter is looking for pigs for a petting zoo he takes down a house of straw and a house made of sticks, this is a reference to the fairy tale Three Little Pigs. Peter is also struck in the head by a paint can on a string, a reference to the film Home Alone. Items added to the suicide cult punch mix by Jennifer include cyanide, arsenic, rat poison, and the book Couplehood by Paul Reiser. The episode title is a reference to the 1968 musical film, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Reception A 2008 review of the episode written by Ahsan Haque of IGN was generally positive; Haque stated that while he did not believe \\"Chitty Chitty Death Bang\\" was an \\"instant classic,\\" it has \\"plenty of memorable moments\\" and \\"a nicely crafted storyline.\\" Haque went on to praise Peter's attempt to \\"convince that the people at Cheesie Charlie's are Nazi devils who kidnapped him and that he only manages to escape because he was able to turn into the Incredible Hulk,\\" as well as Stewie's role in the episode, calling it \\"extremely clever.\\" Haque concluded his review by rating the episode an 8.4/10. David Williams from the DVD Movie Guide said that this and other episodes of the first season did a marvelous job of introducing the characters of the series to the viewers. In his review of \\"Chitty Chitty Death Bang\\" the TV Critic called the writing in the episode wittier than in previous ones. He found the Stewie storyline very enjoyable, and also commented positively on the moral of the story. He criticized the Meg storyline as he did not find mass suicide funny; he also commented that Peter felt a lot like Homer from The Simpsons. In his final comments he said it had some odd moments but it was a fun story.

Rules A Kings in the Corner game in progressEach player is dealt seven cards from the top of the deck. A gameplay \\"board\\" is then set up on the playing surface. Four cards are laid down, face-up, in a plus pattern, with the remainder of the deck face down in the middle. In this fashion there should be a card north, south, east and west of the deck with empty spaces in the \\"corners\\". The player who takes the first turn is determined by each player drawing a random card from the deck; the player with the highest draw takes the first turn. If you are playing with two players, whoever did not deal the cards will go first. Alternatively, the person to the left of the dealer starts. On their turn, a player may perform any number of the following moves in any order. # attempting to discard from their hand by playing their cards in descending numerical order in a suit of the opposite color using the \\"foundation\\" cards as a starting point. For instance, if there is a four of clubs sitting on the playing board, a player can take a three of diamonds or hearts from their hand and discard it onto that four. Players can continue playing as many cards from their hand as are eligible for play in this fashion. # If at any time a player has a King in their hand they have to (during their turn) place it in one of the empty corners (thus the origin of the game's name.) These corner stacks now become active in gameplay and cards can be played on them during turns in the same fashion as the normal game board. # Move an entire foundation pile onto another foundation pile if the bottom card of the moving pile is one rank lower and opposite in color to the top card of the pile you are moving it onto. # Play any card from your hand to any of the original (N, E, S, W) foundation piles that have become empty (because the card(s) that were originally in it have been moved to another pile). If a player has already laid down a card, then it becomes part of the playing board and can not be picked up even if the players turn is not over. At the end of the player's turn, they draw a card from the stock. If a player cannot play any cards in their hand (or does not wish to), they must draw from the stock/deck and end their turn, or in an alternate version, draw until they find a card that can be played, play it and then end their turn with another draw. The first player to play all of his or her cards onto the board is the winner. A variation involves a player collecting each corner that they complete, whereby the winner is determined to be the player that owns the most corners by the end of play.

The Village Act of 1891 defined the form of government to consist of a five-member board of trustees to be elected to three-year staggered terms. One member serves as president, one member serves as treasurer. This act was repealed by the State Legislature in 1961. The Village Act of 1989 changed the essence of the Village form of government, essentially eliminating it in all but name. As of January 1, 1990, every village operating under the Village Form of government had to operate according to the laws pertaining to the Township form. Essentially, the Village form of government is now identical to the Township form, except that the Township Committee and Mayor in the Township form correspond to the Board of Trustees and the President of the Board in the Village form.New Jersey Municipal History and the Traditional Forms of Government , New Jersey State Library, p. 10.

In the early morning traders would load their barrows at the wholesale markets, clean and sort the goods, and then sell them in the new suburban streets. In many cases, the sites of these markets became London‚Äôs modern high streets. = Management by the police (1867‚Äì1927) = In 1867, section six of the Metropolitan Streets Act effectively prohibited street trading. Following public meetings and press criticism, the act was amended within weeks. Section one of the Metropolitan Streets Act Amendment Act 1867 exempted traders but they were now subject to regulation by the police. The market was still on the High Street in 1878: > Saturday evenings the upper part of the street, thronged as it is with > stalls of itinerant vendors of the necessaries of daily life, and with the > dwellers in the surrounding districts, presents to an ordinary spectator all > the attributes of a market place.Walford, Edward. \\"Old and New London (Vol. > V)\\", pp. 309-324, Cassell, Petter & Galpin, London, 1878. Retrieved on 1 May > 2020. = Management by local councils (1927‚Äìpresent) = Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras (1927‚Äì1965)  The London County Council (General Powers) Act 1927 replaced police regulation with a new licensing regime administered by metropolitan borough councils. From 1927 to 1965 the market was managed by the Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras. Benedetta‚Äôs The Street Markets of London makes only a passing reference to Inverness Street Market indicating that it was trading on weekdays only with mostly fruit and vegetables to purchase. Latterly a successful boxing trainer, George Francis worked on Inverness Street Market in the 1940s.  London Borough of Camden (1965‚Äìpresent)  In 1965 the Borough of St Pancras was abolished and its area became part of the London Borough of Camden. In the mid-1980s the market is described as thriving with fifty stalls predominately selling fruit and veg as well as cheese, meat, and household goods. By the mid-nineties the market had declined somewhat to thirty stalls. Whilst the range of products had remained similar to that of ten years before, the stalls closest to Camden High Street had changed their lines to souvenirs.

After over a hundred years and following complaints for residents of the streets and local shop traders the Council insisted that the barrows be removed from the street when the market was not trading. Due to the lack of storage options, the barrows had to be destroyed and many of the remaining fruit and veg traders left. Until the 2010s the market was predominately fruit and veg. However, as the traditional shops turned into bars and eateries to cater to Camden‚Äôs booming tourist and night-time economies the market evolved towards clothing, souvenirs, and street-food. As of 2020 the traders are mainly selling, clothing, souvenirs, and street food. In popular culture Inverness Street Market was used as a filming location in the British drama television serial The Interceptor in 2015.

Mechanism of acquired resistance Vancomycin Six different types of vancomycin resistance are shown by enterococcus: Van-A, Van-B, Van-C, Van-D, Van-E and Van-G. The significance is that Van-A VRE is resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, Van-B VRE is resistant to vancomycin but susceptible to teicoplanin, and Van-C is only partly resistant to vancomycin. The mechanism of resistance to vancomycin found in enterococcus involves the alteration of the peptidoglycan synthesis pathway. The D-alanyl- D-lactate variation results in the loss of one hydrogen-bonding interaction (four, as opposed to five for D-alanyl-D-alanine) being possible between vancomycin and the peptide. The D-alanyl-D-serine variation causes a six-fold loss of affinity between vancomycin and the peptide, likely due to steric hindrance. Diagnosis Once the individual has VRE, it is important to ascertain which strain. Screening Screening for VRE can be accomplished in a number of ways. For inoculating peri-rectal/anal swabs or stool specimens directly, one method uses bile esculin azide agar plates containing 6 Œºg/ml of vancomycin. Black colonies should be identified as an enterococcus to species level and further confirmed as vancomycin resistant by an MIC method before reporting as VRE. Vancomycin resistance can be determined for enterococcal colonies available in pure culture by inoculating a suspension of the organism onto a commercially available brain heart infusion agar (BHIA) plate containing 6 Œºg/ml vancomycin. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) recommends performing a vancomycin MIC test and also motility and pigment production tests to distinguish species with acquired resistance (vanA and vanB) from those with vanC intrinsic resistance. Treatment of infection Linezolid Ceftriaxone (a third generation cephalosporin) use is a risk factor for colonization and infection by VRE, and restriction of cephalosporin usage has been associated with decreased VRE infection and transmission in hospitals. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), a strain of L. rhamnosus, was used successfully for the first time to treat gastrointestinal carriage of VRE. In the US, linezolid is commonly used to treat VRE.  History  To become vancomycin-resistant, vancomycin-sensitive enterococci typically obtain new DNA in the form of plasmids or transposons which encode genes that confer vancomycin resistance. This acquired vancomycin resistance is distinguished from the natural vancomycin resistance of certain enterococcal species including E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus/flavescens. High-level vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis and E. faecium are clinical isolates first documented in the 1980s. In the United States, vancomycin- resistant E. faecium was associated with 4% of healthcare-associated infections reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network from January 2006 to October 2007. VRE can be carried by healthy people who have come into contact with the bacteria, usually in a hospital (nosocomial infection), although it is thought that a significant percentage of intensively farmed chickens also carry VRE. Other regions have noted a similar distribution, but with increased incidence of VRE. For example, a 2006 study of nosocomial VRE revealed a rapid spread of resistance among enterococci along with an emerging shift in VRE distribution in the Middle East region, such as Iran. Treatment failures in enterococcal infections result from inadequate information regarding glycopeptide resistance of endemic enterococci due to factors such as the presence of VanA and VanB. The study from Iran reported the first case of VRE isolates that carried VanB gene in enterococcal strains from Iran. This study also noted the first documented isolation of nosocomial E. raffinosus and E. mundtii in the Middle East region.

As we move higher and higher up in wealth we find fewer and fewer people having that wealth and vice versa. The bottom of the pyramid, bottom of the wealth pyramid or the bottom of the income pyramid is the largest, but poorest socio-economic group. In global terms, this is the 2.7 billion people who live on less than $2.50 a day. Management scholar CK Prahalad popularised the idea of this demographic as a profitable consumer base in his 2004 book The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid, written alongside Stuart Hart. History U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt used the term in his April 7, 1932 radio address, The Forgotten Man, in which he said, The more current usage refers to the billions of people living on less than $2.50 per day, the definition proposed in 1998 by C.K. Prahalad and Stuart L. Hart. It was subsequently expanded upon by both in their books: The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid by Prahalad in 2004 and Capitalism at the Crossroads by Hart in 2005. Prahalad proposes that businesses, governments, and donor agencies stop thinking of the poor as victims and instead start seeing them as resilient and creative entrepreneurs as well as value-demanding consumers.* He proposes that there are tremendous benefits to multi-national companies who choose to serve these markets in ways responsive to their needs. After all the poor of today are the middle class of tomorrow. There are also poverty reducing benefits if multi-nationals work with civil society organizations and local governments to create new local business models. However, there is some debate over Prahalad's proposition. Aneel Karnani, also of the Ross School at the University of Michigan, argued in a 2007 paper that there is no fortune at the bottom of the pyramid and that for most multinational companies the market is really very small. Karnani also suggests that the only way to alleviate poverty is to focus on the poor as producers, rather than as a market of consumers. Prahalad later provided a multi-page response to Karnani's article. Additional critiques of Prahalad's proposition have been gathered in \\"Advancing the 'Base of the Pyramid' Debate\\". Meanwhile, Hart and his colleague Erik Simanis at Cornell University's Center for Sustainable Global Enterprise advance another approach, one that focuses on the poor as business partners and innovators, rather than just as potential producers or consumers. Hart and Simanis have led the development of the Base of the Pyramid Protocol, an entrepreneurial process that guides companies in developing business partnerships with income-poor communities in order to \\"co- create businesses and markets that mutually benefit the companies and the communities\\". This process has been adopted by the SC Johnson Company and the Solae Company (a subsidiary of DuPont). Furthermore, Ted London at the William Davidson Institute at the University of Michigan focuses on the poverty alleviation implications of Base of the Pyramid ventures. He has created a BoP teaching module designed for integration into a wide variety of courses common at business schools that explain the current BoP thinking. He has identified the BoP Perspective as a unique market-based approach to poverty alleviation. London has also developed the BoP Impact Assessment Framework, a tool that provides a holistic and robust guide for BoP ventures to assess and enhance their poverty alleviation impacts. This framework, along with other tools and approaches, is outlined in London's Base of the Pyramid Promise and has been implemented by companies, non-profits, and development agencies in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Another recent focus of interest lies on the impact of successful BoP-approaches on sustainable development. Some of the most significant obstacles encountered when integrating sustainable development at the BoP are the limits to growth that restrict the extended development of the poor, especially when applying a resource-intensive Western way of living. Nevertheless, from a normative ethical perspective poverty alleviation is an integral part of sustainable development according to the notion of intragenerational justice (i.e. within the living generation) in the Brundtland Commission's definition. Ongoing research addresses these aspects and widens the BoP approach also by integrating it into corporate social responsibility thinking.  What is the actual shape of the wealth pyramid?  Approximate visualisation of the wealth pyramid when 1% population controls 50% of the wealth The pyramid is a graphical depiction of inverse relationship between two variables as one increases the other decreases. We find that the percent of world wealth and the percent of world population controlling it are related with each other in an inverse relation. If we plot the world wealth in percent terms along the vertical axis of a graph and the corresponding percent population having control on it on the horizontal axis of a graph and add the mirror image of this graph on the left side of the vertical axis we get a wealth pyramid and can see that as we move to higher and higher wealth brackets we find that fewer and fewer people have access to it, thus the figure has a wide bottom and a lean top similar to the pyramids of Egypt. It has been reported that the gap between the ToP and BoP is widening over time in such a way that only 1% of the world population controls 50% of the wealth today, and the other 99% is having access to the remaining 50% only. On the basis of this report the wealth pyramid would look like the one shown in the illustration. How low is the bottom? The standards and benchmarks developed ‚Äì for example less than $2.5 a day ‚Äì always tell us about the upper limit of what we call the BoP, and not actually about its base or bottom. The fact is that the bottom or the base is much much lower. Even going by the official definition, for example in India the Rangarajan Committee after re- examining the issue of poverty defined the poverty line in 2011-12 at INR 47.00 ($0.69) per capita per day for urban areas and INR 32.00 ($0.47) per capita per day in rural areas (June 2016 conversion rate),Puri, V. K., & Misra, S. K. (2015). Indian Economy. New Delhi: Himalya Publishing House. obviously much less than the $2.5 per day benchmark. This again is the upper layer of the poor as defined by the Rangarajan Committee. Where is the actual bottom? and how low? This can perhaps only be visualised by observing the slums right in the hearts of the cities in the developing countries. Good business sense and the BoP markets Kash Rangan, John Quelch, and other faculty members at the Global Poverty Project at Harvard Business School \\"believe that in pursuing its own self-interest in opening and expanding the BoP market, business can make a profit while serving the poorest of consumers and contributing to development.\\" According to Rangan, \\"For business, the bulk of emerging markets worldwide is at the bottom of the pyramid so it makes good business sense ‚Äì not a sense of do-gooding ‚Äì to go after it.\\" But in the view of Friedman \\"the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits only, thus, it needs to be examined whether business in BoP markets is capable of achieving the dual objective of making a profit while serving the poorest of consumers and contributing to development?\\" Erik Simanis has reported that the model has a fatal flaw. According to Simanis, \\"Despite achieving healthy penetration rates of 5% to 10% in four test markets, for instance, Procter & Gamble couldn‚Äôt generate a competitive return on its Pur water-purification powder after launching the product on a large scale in 2001...DuPont ran into similar problems with a venture piloted from 2006 to 2008 in Andhra Pradesh, India, by its subsidiary Solae, a global manufacturer of soy protein ... Because the high costs of doing business among the very poor demand a high contribution per transaction, companies must embrace the reality that high margins and price points aren't just a top-of-the-pyramid phenomenon; they‚Äôre also a necessity for ensuring sustainable businesses at the bottom of the pyramid.\\" Marc Gunther states that, \\"The bottom-of-the-pyramid (BOP) market leader, arguably, is Unilever ... Its signature BOP product is Pureit, a countertop water-purification system sold in India, Africa and Latin America. It's saving lives, but it's not making money for shareholders.\\" Several consulting companies have modeled the profitability of accessing the bottom of pyramid by utilizing economies of scale. Examples of BoP businessMicrocredit= One example of \\"bottom of the pyramid\\" is the growing microcredit market in South Asia, particularly in Bangladesh. With technology being steadily cheaper and more ubiquitous, it is becoming economically efficient to \\"lend tiny amounts of money to people with even tinier assets\\". An Indian banking report argues that the microfinance network (called \\"Sa- Dhan\\" in India) \\"helps the poor\\" and \\"allows banks to 'increase their business'\\". However, formal lenders must avoid the phenomenon of informal intermediation: Some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro-entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance split loans into smaller credit to even poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to 'loan sharks' at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum. =Market-specific products= One of many examples of products that are designed with needs of the very poor in mind is that of a shampoo that works best with cold water and is sold in small packets to reduce barriers of upfront costs for the poor. Such a product is marketed by Hindustan Unilever. =Innovation= There is a traditional view that BOP consumers do not want to adopt innovation easily. However, C. K. Prahalad (2005) claimed against this traditional view, positing that the BOP market is very eager to adopt innovations. For instance, BOP consumers are using PC kiosks, Mobile phone, Mobile banking etc. Relative advantage and Complexity attributes of an innovation suggested by Everett Rogers (2004) significantly influence the adoption of an innovation in the Bottom of pyramid market (Rahman, Hasan, and Floyd, 2013). Therefore, innovation developed for this market should focus on these two attributes (Relative advantage and Complexity). =Venture capital= Whereas Prahalad originally focused on corporations for developing BoP products and entering BoPmarkets, it is believed by many that Small to Medium Enterprises (SME) might even play a bigger role. For Limited Partners (LPs), this offers an opportunity to enter new venture capital markets. Although several social venture funds are already active, true Venture Capital (VC) funds are now emerging. =Brand= There is a traditional view that BOP consumers are not brand conscious (prahalad, 2005). However, C. K. Prahalad (2005) claimed against this traditional view, positing that the BOP market is brand conscious. For instance, brand influences the new product adoption in the bottom of pyramid market (Rahman, Hasan, and Floyd, 2013). Rahman et al. (2013) mentioned that brand may positively influence the relative advantage of an innovation and it leads to adoption of innovation in the BOP. In point of traditional view BOP market, people were not aware about brand concept. Sopan Kumbhar (2013) =Business and community partnerships= As Fortune reported on November 15, 2006, since 2005 the SC Johnson Company has been partnering with youth groups in the Kibera slum of Nairobi, Kenya. Together SC Johnson and the groups have created a community-based waste management and cleaning company, providing home- cleaning, insect treatment, and waste disposal services for residents of the slum. SC Johnson's project was the first implementation of the \\"Base of the Pyramid Protocol\\". Conferences There have been a number of academic and professional conferences focused on the BoP.

History Deriving from the Old English \\"under\\" a preposition meaning \\"under\\" or \\"below\\", plus \\"wuda\\", a wood. The name was originally given to one dwelling at the foot of a wood or literally \\"below the trees of a forest\\". The name may also be locational from three places named with these elements i.e., Underwood in Derbyshire, England, Underwood, Nottinghamshire, England. The surname is first recorded in the latter half of the 12th Century (see below). One William Underwude appears in the 1219 Assize Court Rolls of Yorkshire, and a William under the Wode in the 1332 Subsidy Rolls of Staffordshire. From the beginning of the surviving parish registers in 1559 there were Underwoods recorded in Pickering parish, North Yorkshire, England. On 2 January 1634, one Joseph Underwood, aged 23 yrs., embarked from London on the ship \\"Bonaventure\\" bound for Virginia. He was one of the earliest recorded name bearers to enter America. No less than seven Coats of Arms were granted to families of this name; a particular namebearer mentioned in the Dictionary of National Biography was one Michael Underwood (1737‚Äì1820) who practised in London as a surgeon and as a \\"male-midwife\\". The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of William de Underwode which was dated 1188, in the \\"Records of Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk\\", during the reign of King Henry II, known as \\"The Builder of Churches\\", 1154 - 1189.

He developed many laboratory techniques related to isolation of organic compounds. In 1907 he described a device for the accurate determination of melting points, since named Thiele tube after him. Thiele was born in Ratibor, Prussia, now Racib√≥rz, Poland. Thiele studied mathematics at the University of Breslau but later turned to chemistry, receiving his doctorate from Halle in 1890 . He taught at the University of Munich from 1893 to 1902, when he was appointed professor of chemistry at Strasbourg. He developed the preparation of glyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone). After Kekul√©'s proposal for benzene structure in 1865, Thiele suggested a \\"Partial Valence Hypothesis\\", which concerned double and triple carbon-carbon bonds with which he explains their particular reactivity. In 1899 this led to the prediction of the resonance that existed in benzene, and he proposed a resonance structure, by using a broken circle to represent the partial bonds.Thiele, Johannes (1899) \\"Zur Kenntnis der unges√§ttigten Verbindungen\\" (On our knowledge of unsaturated compounds), Justus Liebig‚Äôs Annalen der Chemie,306: 87-142; see: \\"VIII. Die aromatischen Verbindungen. Das Benzol.\\" (VIII. The aromatic compounds. Benzene.), pages 125-129. Later this problem was completely solved with the advent of quantum theory. In 1899, Thiele was head of Organic Chemistry at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences in Munich. With his associate Otto Holzinger, he synthesised an iminodibenzyl nucleus: two benzene rings attached together by a nitrogen atom and an ethylene bridge. He discovered the condensation of ketones and aldehydes with cyclopentadiene as a route to fulvenes. He also recognized that these deeply colored species were related to but isomeric with benzene derivatives. According to one of his students Heinrich Otto Wieland, Thiele had a dislike of the chemistry of natural products.

SLC-3E (East) is currently used by the Atlas V launch vehicle, while SLC-3W (West) has been demolished. Launches from Vandenberg fly southward, allowing payloads to be placed in high- inclination orbits such as polar or Sun-synchronous orbit, which allow full global coverage on a regular basis and are often used for weather, Earth observation, and reconnaissance satellites. These orbits are difficult to reach from Cape Canaveral, where launches must fly eastward due to major population centers to both the north and south of Kennedy Space Center. Avoiding these would require hugely inefficient maneuvering, greatly reducing payload capacity. SLC-3E was the launch site of the Mars lander InSight in May 2018. SLC-3E 150px It was reported in 2003 that SLC-3E would be overhauled to serve as a launch platform for the Atlas V. Renovations of SLC-3E began after a January 2004 ground breaking ceremony. Along with other work, the Mobile Service Tower roof was raised by approximately to a height of to accommodate an Atlas V 500 series vehicle with its larger payload fairing. In July 2004, Lockheed Martin announced the arrival of the fourth and final segment of the fixed launch platform (FLP). The segments had been transported from a fabrication facility in Oak Hill, FL, away. The largest segment weighed 90 tons and was \\"thought to be the biggest over-the-road shipment ever attempted cross-country.\\" In February 2005, the activation team handed over the launch pad to the operational team, marking the end of major reconstruction. The first Atlas V launch from SLC-3E took place at 10:02 GMT on March 13, 2008. =History= One of two Atlas-Agena pads at VAFB, SLC-3E was originally the designated facility for MIDAS (Missile Defense Alarm System) launches and hosted its first flight on 12 July 1961. After the MIDAS program ended in 1966, SLC-3E then hosted reentry vehicle tests in 1967-68 as part of Project PRIME. The pad was mothballed for a decade, then returned to use in the late 1970s for NAVSTAR communications satellites on refurbished Atlas E/F missiles. On 19 December 1981, Atlas 76E crashed a few hundred feet from the pad after an engine failure, but no serious damage resulted to facilities. SLC-3E was then converted for the Atlas H (Atlas-Centaur core with a solid upper stage in place of the Centaur) and hosted ELINT satellite launches from 1983-87. The pad was mothballed once again and not used for the next 12 years, when it was revived for the Atlas IIAS. Three successful Atlas IIAS missions were flown from SLC-3E.

In 1962-63, the pad was converted for Thor-Agena use and was the primary launching site for Corona reconnaissance satellites for the next decade.

One of the most idealistic neorealist filmmakers of the 1940s and 1950s, he wrote and directed films punctuated by ardent cries for social reform. He was the brother of Italian cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis. His wife was Gordana Miletic, a Yugoslav actress and former ballet dancer. Biography De Santis was born in Fondi, Lazio. He was a member of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and fought with the anti-German Resistance in Rome during World War II. He was first a student of philosophy and literature before entering Rome's Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia. While working as a journalist for Cinema magazine, De Santis became, under the influence of Cesare Zavattini, a major proponent of the early neorealist filmmakers who were trying to make films that mirrored the simple and tragic realities of proletarian life using location shooting and nonprofessional actors. In 1942, De Santis collaborated on the script for Ossessione, Luchino Visconti's debut film, which is usually considered one of the first neo-realist films. While still working for Cinema magazine, he increasingly worked as a screenwriter and assistant director until 1947 when he made his own directorial debut with Caccia Tragica (Tragic Hunt). Like the two films to follow, it was a sincere call for better living conditions for the Italian working class and agrarian workers. Issues of corruption, the black market, collaboration with the Germans, and treatment of ex-soldiers were also introduced in the film. His third film Bitter Rice (1950), the story of a young woman working in the rice fields who must choose between two socially disparate suitors, made a star of Silvana Mangano and was a landmark of the new cinematic style. It also earned De Santis an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Story. By the early 1950s, the neorealist movement was falling out of favour with critics and audiences. New filmmakers began using dramatic stories that centered on relationships and de Santis also altered his focus. In 1952 he filmed Roma ore 11 (Rome 11 o'clock), the first version of the real tragic accident that Augusto Genina remade in 1953 as Three Forbidden Stories. In 1959 he won a Golden Globe with La strada lunga un anno; the film, produced in Yugoslavia, had a nomination for the Oscar as Best Foreign Language Film. In 1979 he was a member of the jury at the 11th Moscow International Film Festival. In 1985 he was a member of the jury at the 14th Moscow International Film Festival. De Santis died in 1997 at the age of 80, in Rome, following a heart attack, and a day of mourning was declared in Italy. A part of his archives have been donated to the Reynolds Library of Wake Forest University. Also, his wife and friends have established a Foundation named after him.

It is rounded, grassy and fairly unassuming, occupying a large amount of land. However, it is classed as a Marilyn because of the low elevation of the col connecting it to Haycock, its nearest higher neighbour to the north. The name Seatallan is believed to have a Cumbric origin, meaning \\"Aleyn's high pasture\\". Topography The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): Seatallan is an outlier of the southern arm. The main watershed runs broadly westwards from Great Gable, dividing the headwaters of Ennerdale and Wasdale. Travelling in this direction the principal hills are Kirk Fell, Pillar, Scoat Fell, Haycock and Caw Fell. Haycock sends out a long southern ridge terminating in Seatallan. Seatallan seen from an ascent on its southern slopes from Nether Wasdale. Seatallan begins at the Pots of Ashness, a broad grassy depression to the south of Haycock. From here a stiff ascent up what may have been a landslip leads directly to the summit. The top of the fell resembles a truncated cone, cut off at an angle and sloping away to the south. This cone in turn stands upon a much broader upland plateau which stretches away five miles to the south west. The River Bleng forms the entire western boundary, beginning on the slopes of Haycock and then flowing out in a huge loop to the south west. It finally joins the Irt and continues on to the sea at Ravenglass. The extremity of the Bleng's circuit, near to Gosforth, is given over to lowland cultivation and although belonging topographically to Seatallan could hardly be termed fellside. Higher up the south western shoulder are conifer plantations, both along the Bleng and above the Irt. Open fellside begins two miles south west of the summit. To the east of Pots of Ashness is the valley of Nether Beck, flowing to Wastwater, with Red Pike beyond. Nether Beck swings away from Seatallan on its southward journey, diverted by the rocky height of Middle Fell. This is Seatallan's principal satellite, a broad ridge falling from the east of the summit cone. Middle Fell curves around to run parallel to Seatallan with the valley of Greendale Gill dividing the two. The stream begins at Greendale Tarn, nestled into the steep face of Middle Fell. The tarn, around 30 ft deep, sits in a long narrow bowl, looked down on by a collection of huge boulders.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): Seatallan's most prominent feature is Buckbarrow, the 400 ft rampart of crags on the southern edge overlooking lower Greendale and Wast Water. Buckbarrow is given a separate chapter in A. Wainwright's The Western Fells, and is thus classed as a Wainwright, despite having virtually no topographic prominence of its own. That convention is followed here. Above Buckbarrow are the minor tops of Glade How and Cat Bield, leading onto the great south west shoulder. Seatallan has other areas of much less impressive crag above the upper Bleng (Raven Crag) and Nether Beck (Winscale How). Geology Much of the fell is covered in deep drift deposits, but the underlying rock is generally the plagioclase-phyric dacite lava referred to as Seatallan Dacite. Above the Bleng are large areas of diorite, while around Buckbarrow there are outcrops of the andesite Birker Fell Formation. Minor intrusions of rhyolite and basalt have been located to the north.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 38: BGS (1998) Summit A large tumulus marks the summit, alongside an Ordnance Survey triangulation column. The top is grassed and it is assumed that the tumulus was built from stones on the north slope. The view is heavily obstructed by the main range of the western fells, the highpoints being the Scafells and Coniston Fells. Wastwater can be brought into view by walking north east. Ascents Indirect ascents via Buckbarrow begin from Harrow Head. An alternative bypasses the subsidiary summit to gain Cat Bields from the south west. From Greendale the gill can be followed almost to the tarn, before branching off up the grassy slopes of Seatallan. If preferred Middle Fell can be used as a stepping stone onto Seatallan from the same point. Finally from Nether Beck Bridge the route to Haycock can be used, turning west via Lad Crag Beck to the summit.Bill Birkett:Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): References Category:Marilyns of England Category:Hewitts of England Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Nuttalls Category:Borough of Copeland ","title":"Seatallan"},{"id":"2461043","text":"Janet Elizabeth Courtney (born Barton-upon-Humber, 27 November 1865; died London, 24 September 1954) was an English scholar, writer and feminist. Early life She was a daughter of the Revd George Hogarth and Jane Elizabeth Uppleby; sister of the archaeologist David George Hogarth. She was educated at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, 1885-1888 and was awarded a first class degree in Philosophy. Philosophy was still a male-dominated subject when Hogarth wished to study it, so that she was forced to petition the men's lecture courses for access. Benjamin Jowett agreed to allow her to join classes at Balliol College, where she joined lectures on the pre-Socratics given by Richard Lewis Nettleship. She had to sit at the High Table, away from the audience of male undergraduates, and was sometimes accompanied by Elizabeth Wordsworth as a chaperone, who could be heard disagreeing with the lecturer. Following the Nettleship lecturers New College gave permission for Hogarth to attend lectures on Plato given by William Leonard Courtney, who would support her education by interceding with other lectures on her behalf, and later become her husband. Professional life She first had a part-time teaching post at Cheltenham Ladies' College, then worked as a clerk for the Royal Commission on Labour, 1892‚Äì94; was the first superintendent of women clerks of the Bank of England, 1894-1906; Librarian of The Times Book Club, 1906-1910; and on the editorial staff of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1906-1914 and 1920-22. She was joint-editor for indexing of the 11th and 12th editions and contributed 700 of the shorter biographies for the former and signed articles on women to the latter. In 1911 she married William Leonard Courtney, editor of the Fortnightly Review and chief dramatic critic and literary editor of the Daily Telegraph. She was adviser on staff welfare to the Ministry of Munitions 1916-1917 and in the latter year was awarded an OBE. She was also a JP. She was a Board member of the Executive Committee of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust from 1913. Following the death of her husband in 1928 she became acting editor of the Fortnightly Review from November 1928 to June 1929. She was the author of a number of books of aspects of feminism as well as several volumes of reminiscences that contain valuable insights into her working life at the Bank of England, The Times and the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

Life and career Bonisteel was born in Ameliasburg, Ontario and was a seventh generation native of the Quinte West region. He began his journalism career with newspapers in Belleville and Trenton, the Belleville Intelligencer and Trentonian, respectively. In 1951, he began his broadcasting career in radio in the city of Belleville, Ontario, working at CJBQ. From this start he moved to CKTB radio in St. Catharines, Ontario in 1953. After 12 years at CKTB he left in 1964 to try for a job at a different station. He failed to obtain this job, so Bonisteel moved into religious broadcasting. (Canadian broadcasting regulation at the time required radio stations to broadcast religious shows.) He entered into an agreement with the United Church of Canada to produce a 15-minute program titled Checkpoint. His efforts led this show to be syndicated across Canada. This then led to a position as director of broadcast for the United Church in Vancouver in 1965. He received an appointment as head of ecumenical radio operations for the Anglican, Roman Catholic and United churches, in Vancouver, the first person to have such an assignment. Bonisteel started a religious open-line radio program titled God Talk on CKWX, with a panel consisting of Rev. Walter Donald, Fr. John Shields and Rev. Jack Shaver with the occasional guest. In 1967, Bonisteel met Leo Rampen, an executive producer at CBC Television. Rampen was looking for a host for Man Alive, a new series that would explore man's religious dimensions, and chose Bonisteel for the job. In the next 22 years, Bonisteel would go on to interview Malcolm Muggeridge, Elie Wiesel, Mother Teresa, 14th Dalai Lama, Hans K√ºng and many others. Memorable shows include broadcasts from Belfast (1974), Africa (1975), and May's Miracle (the story of May, Joe and Leslie Lemke). He summed up his philosophy in a speech at the 80th anniversary celebration of Grace United Church in Weyburn, Saskatchewan: \\"We are moulded into a materialist world where we do a lot of eating, drinking and making merry until we ask the basic questions 'Who am I? Where am I going? What is our purpose in life?'\\". After retiring from journalism, Bonisteel served as a citizenship judge for seven years. In 1999 and 2000, Bonisteel served as director of journalism and communication at the University of Regina. Bonisteel died the morning of 16 August 2013 from cancer at his home in Johnstown, Quinte West Ontario; he was 83. He is survived by daughters Lesley and Mandy Bonisteel and son Steve Bonisteel and by nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.  Awards and honours  A winner of two awards of excellence in broadcast journalism, Bonisteel also received six honorary doctorates including an honorary Doctorate of Letters from Laurentian University in Sudbury, and an honorary Doctorate of Divinity from Queen's University in Kingston. In 1994, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada. Bonisteel was also a recipient of the Canada 125 Medal in 1992, the Distinguished Canadian Award from the University of Regina in 1994, two ACTRA Awards and the Gordon Sinclair Award for excellence in broadcast journalism and award for \\"best television host in Canada.\\" Published worksBooks= *Man Alive the Human Journey, 1983, Collins Publishers *In Search of Man Alive, 1980, Collins Publishers *All Things Considered, 1997, Doubleday Canada, * There was a time \\" =Video= *Circle of Witches *All their Own *May's Miracle ReferencesExternal links * Category:1930 births Category:Canadian television journalists Category:2013 deaths Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:Queen's University at Kingston alumni Category:People from Prince Edward County, Ontario Category:Canadian television hosts Category:Canadian citizenship judges Category:Deaths from cancer in Ontario ","title":"Roy Bonisteel"},{"id":"2461061","text":"Arthur de La Gu√©ronni√®re. Louis √âtienne Arthur du Breuil, vicomte de La Gu√©ronni√®re (1816 ‚Äì 23 December 1875) was a French politician and aristocrat, the member of a notable Poitou family. Biography Although from early on connected with Legitimism, he became closely associated with the Republican Alphonse de Lamartine, to whose paper, Le Bien Public, he was a principal contributor. After Le Bien Public came to an end, he wrote for La Presse, and in 1850 edited Le Pays. A character sketch of Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte in this journal caused differences with Lamartine, and La Gu√©ronni√®re became more and more closely identified with the policy of the prince-president. Under the Second Empire, he was a member of the Conseil d'√âtat (1853), senator (1861), ambassador to Belgium (1868), and to the Ottoman Empire (1870), and Grand Officer of the L√©gion d'honneur (1866). He died in Paris. Besides his √âtudes et portraits politiques contemporains (1856) his most important works are those on the foreign policy of the Empire: La France, Rome et Italie (1851), Le Pape et le Congr√®s (1859), L'Abandon de Rome (1862), De la politique int√©rieure et ext√©rieure de la France (1862). His elder brother, Alfred du Breuil Helion, comte de La Gu√©ronni√®re (1810‚Äì1884), who remained faithful to the Legitimist party, was also a well-known writer and journalist. He was consistent in his opposition to the July Monarchy and the Empire, but in a series of books on the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871 showed a more favorable attitude to the Third French Republic.

It grew from New York hip hop fashion and eventually California surfskate culture, to encompass elements of sportswear, punk and Japanese street fashion. Eventually haute couture became an influence. It commonly centers on \\"casual, comfortable pieces such as jeans, T-shirts, baseball caps, and sneakers\\", and exclusivity through intentional product scarcity. Enthusiasts follow particular brands and try to obtain limited edition releases. History Streetwear style is generally accepted to have been born out of the New York City hip hop culture of the late 1970s and early 1980s, with elements of the Los Angeles surf culture. Early streetwear in the 1970s and 1980s also took inspiration from hip hop, the DIY aesthetic of punk, Japanese street fashion, new wave, heavy metal, and co-opting established legacy sportswear and workwear fashion brands such as Schott NYC, Dr. Martens, Kangol, Fila and Adidas. In the late 1980s, surfboard designer Shawn Stussy began selling printed T-shirts featuring the same trademark signature he placed on his custom surfboards. Initially selling the items from his own car, Stussy expanded sales to boutiques once popularity increased. Then as sales peaked, St√ºssy moved into exclusive sales to create product scarcity, which firmed up the ultimate baseline definition of streetwear: T-shirts and exclusivity.\\" In the early 1990s, burgeoning record labels associated with popular hip hop acts like Tommy Boy Records, Def Jam Recordings, and Delicious Vinyl began selling branded merchandise embroidered onto letterman jackets and workwear jackets made by companies like Carhartt.The Carhartt Jacket by Michel Marriott, November 29, 1992. In the mid to late 90s, influences included skateboarding and gangsta rap. Professional American sports franchises having a big impact on the scene, especially the New York Yankees, Los Angeles Raiders and Chicago Bulls caps and jackets, with their production of oversized team jerseys, as well as boots from The Timberland Company and the latest shoe design releases from Nike, Inc.. Brand launches by the chief executives of record companies followed, with Russell Simmons of Def Jam launching his Phat Farm label, Sean Combs of Bad Boy with Sean John, and Jay-Z and Damon Dash of Roc-a-Fella Records launching Rocawear. Rap superstar 50 Cent a few years later launched his G-Unit clothing label, with the sneaker rights given to Reebok. In the 2000s, the advent of \\"bling\\" culture saw established luxury brands make inroads into the market, with Burberry, Gucci and Fendi making appearances in hip hop videos and films. The most popular shoe of the era was the Nike Air Force 1, immortalized in the song by Nelly, then the fashion clothing manufacturers began to follow the streetwear companies co-opting the idea of very limited edition capsule collections, now known as \\"drops\\", using social media and product scarcity as marketing tools. In the 2010s, some streetwear brands were now coveted as much as the most historically elite fashion brands. Complex Magazine named St√ºssy, Supreme, and A Bathing Ape as the top streetwear brands, and many went on to collaborate on prized high fashion capsule collections such as Supreme x Louis Vuitton, Fila x Fendi, A Bathing Ape x Commes des Garcons, and Stussy x Dior.Dior x Stussy Fall 2020 by By Jonathan Sawyer, Highsnobiety, Dec 4, 2019.  Contemporary  Timberland boots are a common shoe in streetwear Common sportswear worn in contemporary street styles include hoodies, bomber jackets, tennis-style skirts, track pants, leggings, and sneakers. Some of these are a revival of 1990s hip-hop fashion, which also favoured bomber jackets and baseball caps. Contemporary streetwear is usually influenced by the generic sporty twists and sleek athletic lines. In earlier stages of sportswear fashion, femininity was usually expressed with the lines becoming cleaner, and silhouettes becoming minimal. Later, bold volumes in sportswear started to develop, hi-tech fabrics and old-school approaches were used in styling. In general, relaxed silhouettes, clean shapes, little embellishments, and an overall sophisticated feel would be observed in the looks of the trend. Contemporary streetwear has also become much more influential in the world of haute couture influencing and in turn being influenced by runway shows by prominent designers. Raf Simons has made a large impact on streetwear stylings as it has evolved over the years, this might be attributed by the designers influence in hip hop and popular culture.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eLryuBCO-M Other designers such as Demna Gvasalia, creative director of Vetements and Balenciaga, have also had an impact in recent years championing trends such as the chunky sneaker and the oversized hoodie, which have slowly become streetwear staples. = Luxury sportswear = Alexander Wang developed \\"luxury sportswear\\" in his eponymous brand The decline of formal wear led to the rise of streetwear fashion. High-end and luxury brands began to develop \\"luxury sportswear\\", for example Alexander Wang, Gucci, and DKNY. Among this type of \\"luxury sportswear\\", luxe fabrics were used to produce their sportswear fashion for a high contrast on the sporty silhouette. Fabrics like silk organza, washed satin, leather, neoprene, and wool crepe were used to produce the \\"luxury sportswear\\". These types of fabrics may help experiment a garment with texture, and may assist in capturing a modern-sports spirit of the season. Details of the designs in \\"luxury sportswear\\" looks are pulled directly from actual active wear. The two words, \\"luxury\\" and \\"minimalism\\" were first used together for sportswear in fashion, to interpret a fresh sports look which is sleek and clean, but bearing recognizable athletic influences. Common mix-and- match combination of \\"luxury sportswear\\" on streetwear are track pants under basketball shorts, with bold patterns and sumptuous fabrics for men; and light colored pencil skirts, with bomber jackets and sleek tops, cut in satin or tweed, for women. = Seasonal sportswear = Sportswear in streetwear designs changes according to season and temperature. In winter, sports silhouette tends to turn slouchier and volumes are exaggerated. Solid fabrics such as fur, velvet, wool and leather become predominant, and quilted detailing on windbreakers, sporty skirts and vests can be seen. A typical winter look might be a voluminous sweatshirt with satin boxer shorts, or a brocade bomber jacket worn on top of a laid-back dress featuring mesh detailing. In summer, the look is usually light-weight and simple, with a combination of crop tops, sleek dresses, gym-shorts, and tank-tops. = Hypebeast culture = \\"Hypebeast\\" (occasionally \\"hype beast\\") culture is a colloquial term that at first was considered a derogatory term until Kevin Ma, the founder of the original Hypebeast fashion blog, re-appropriated it to be used as the name of his fashion blog, Hypebeast. Even after Ma's fashion blog expanded to a world- famous website, hypebeast still had some negative connotation. Even though many hypebeasts will refer to themselves as such, taking it as a term of endearment (much like the evolution of the term otaku in Japanese popular culture circles) others still believe in the negative connotation. With a growing trend of prominent brand names and logos on clothing, there has been a development of \\"hypebeast culture\\" connected to streetwear as of the mid-2000s. Hypebeasts are defined as buying clothes and accessories simply to impress others. This trend is inspired by a 1990s fashion for clothing covered in brand names and logos. Hypebeasts usually wear a variety of name brands at once to boast their affluence and display popular trends. = Sneaker culture = Sneakers in streetwear accompanies a wide range of footwear. Sneaker culture is an important part of streetwear. Since 2004, the sneaker market has grown by over 40% and is still on the steady increase.

He was an early proponent of the theory of meteorite impact causing craters such as that of Meteor Crater, Arizona. Fairchild also left his mark on glacial geology. In that field he is best known for having accurately mapped the proglacial lakes of western New York. He did his field work between the 1888 and the early years of the 20th century. He located strand lines (beaches) and erosional surfaces, determined their altitude, and interpolated between them to show the extent of several large bodies of water. A series of lakes was created as the Wisconsinan glaciation ended and ice sheets retreated during the latest Pleistocene and early Holocene epochs. Fairchild discovered several outlets where each lake drained to the east or west. Fairchild was a descendant of Thomas Fairchild who came to Connecticut from England in 1639. Fairchild was an alumnus of Cornell University, with a B.S. degree in 1874. He taught at the University of Rochester for many years and founded the geology department there.

In general, S corporations do not pay any income taxes. Instead, the corporation's income and losses are divided among and passed through to its shareholders. The shareholders must then report the income or loss on their own individual income tax returns. Overview S corporations are ordinary business corporations that elect to pass corporate income, losses, deductions, and credits through to their shareholders for federal tax purposes. The term \\"S corporation\\" means a \\"small business corporation\\" which has made an election under ¬ß 1362(a) to be taxed as an S corporation.26 U.S.C. ¬ß 1361(a)(1) The S corporation rules are contained in Subchapter S of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (sections 1361 through 1379). Congress, acting on the Department of Treasury's suggestion of 1946, created this chapter in 1958 as part of a larger package of miscellaneous tax items. S status combines the legal environment of C corporations with U.S. federal income taxation similar to that of partnerships. As with partnerships, the income, deductions, and tax credits of an S corporation flow through to shareholders annually, regardless of whether distributions are made. Thus, income is taxed at the shareholder level and not at the corporate level. Payments to S shareholders by the corporation are distributed tax-free to the extent that the distributed earnings were previously taxed. =S corporations vs. C corporations= Like a C corporation, an S corporation is generally a corporation under the law of the state in which the entity is organized. However, with modern incorporation statutes making the establishment of a corporation relatively easy, firms that might traditionally have been run as partnerships or sole proprietorships are often run as corporations with a small number of shareholders in order to take advantage of the beneficial features of the corporate form; this is particularly true of firms established prior to the advent of the modern limited liability company. Therefore, taxation of S corporations resembles that of partnerships. Unlike a C corporation, an S corporation is not eligible for a dividends received deduction. Unlike a C corporation, an S corporation is not subject to the 10 percent of taxable income limitation applicable to charitable contribution deductions. Eligibility A corporation is \\"eligible\\" if it: * Has no more than 100 shareholders, * Has shareholders who are all individuals (exceptions are made for various tax-exempt organizations, estates, and trusts) * Has no nonresident as shareholders, and * Has only one class of stock. A limited liability company (LLC) is eligible to be taxed as an S corporation under the check-the-box regulations at ¬ß 301.7701-2. The LLC first elects to be taxed as a corporation, at which point it becomes a corporation for tax purposes; then it makes the S corporation election under section 1362(a). =Shareholder requirements= Shareholders must be U.S. citizens or residents (not nonresident), and must be natural persons, so corporations and partnerships are ineligible shareholders. However, certain trusts, estates, and tax-exempt corporations, notably 501(c)(3) corporations, are permitted to be shareholders.26 U.S.C. ¬ß 1361(c)(6) An S corporation may be a shareholder in another, subsidiary S corporation if the first S corporation owns 100% of the stock of the subsidiary corporation, and an election is made to treat the subsidiary corporation as a \\"qualified subchapter S subsidiary\\" (QSub). After the election is made, the subsidiary corporation is not treated as a separate corporation for tax purposes, and all \\"assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit\\" of the QSub are treated belonging to the parent S corporation.26 U.S.C. ¬ß 1361(b)(3)(A)-(B) Spouses (and their estates) are automatically treated as a single shareholder.26 U.S.C. ¬ß 1361(c)(1)(A)(i) Families, defined as individuals descended from a common ancestor, plus spouses and former spouses of either the common ancestor or anyone lineally descended from that person, are considered a single shareholder as long as any family member elects such treatment. =Stock requirements= An S corporation may only have one class of stock.26 U.S.C. ¬ß 1361(b)(1)(D) A single class of stock means that all outstanding shares of stock confer \\"identical rights to distribution and liquidation proceeds,\\" i.e. profits and losses are allocated to shareholders proportionately to each one's interest in the business. ¬ß 1.1361-1(l)(1). Differences in voting rights are disregarded, which means that an S corporation may have voting and nonvoting stock.26 U.S.C. ¬ß 1361(c)(4) If a corporation meets the foregoing requirements and wishes to be taxed under Subchapter S, its shareholders may file Form 2553: \\"Election by a Small Business Corporation\\" with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Form 2553 must be signed by all of the corporation's shareholders. If a shareholder resides in a community property state, the shareholder's spouse generally must also sign the 2553. The S corporation election must typically be made by the fifteenth day of the third month of the tax year for which the election is intended to be effective, or at any time during the year immediately preceding the tax year.See . Congress has directed the IRS to show leniency with regard to late S elections. Accordingly, often, the IRS will accept a late S election. If a corporation that has elected to be treated as an S corporation ceases to meet the requirements (for example, if as a result of stock transfers, the number of shareholders exceeds 100 or an ineligible shareholder such as a nonresident acquires a share), the corporation will lose its S corporation status and revert to being a regular C corporation. An S corporation's election will also terminate if, for each of three consecutive years, (i) its passive investment income exceeds 25% of gross receipts and (ii) it has accumulated earnings and profits. ¬ß 1362(d)(3). An S corporation will only have accumulated earnings and profits if it was a C corporation at some time, or acquired or merged with a C corporation. Taxation The S election affects the treatment of the corporation for Federal income tax purposes. The election does not change the requirements for that corporation for other Federal taxes such as FICA and Federal unemployment taxes. =Distributions= While an S corporation is not taxed on its profits, the owners of an S corporation are taxed on their proportional shares of the S corporation's profits. Actual distributions of funds, as opposed to distributive shares, typically have no effect on shareholder tax liability. The term \\"pass through\\" refers not to assets distributed by the corporation to the shareholder, but instead to the portion of the corporation's income, losses, deductions or credits that are reported to the shareholder on Schedule K-1 and are shown by the shareholder on his or her own income tax return. However, a distribution to a shareholder that is in excess of the shareholder's basis in his or her stock is taxed to the shareholder as capital gain. Quarterly estimated taxes must be paid by the individual to avoid tax penalties, even if this income is \\"phantom income\\". Example Widgets Inc, an S-Corp, makes $10,000,000 in net income (before payroll) in 2006 and is owned 51% by Bob and 49% by John. Keeping it simple, Bob and John both draw salaries of $94,200 (which is the Social Security Wage Base for 2006, after which no further Social Security tax is owed). Employee salaries are subject to FICA tax (Social Security & Medicare tax) --currently 15.3 percent--(6.2% Social Security paid by the employee; 6.2% Social Security paid by the employer; 1.45% employee medicare and 1.45% employer medicare). The distribution of the additional profits from the S corporation will be done without any further FICA tax liability. If for some reason, Bob (as the majority owner) were to decide not to distribute the money, both Bob and John would still owe taxes on their pro-rata allocation of business income, even though neither received any cash distribution. To avoid this \\"phantom income\\" scenario, S corporations commonly use shareholder agreements that stipulate at least enough distribution must be made for shareholders to pay the taxes on their distributive shares. =Conversion from C corporation= S corporations that have previously been C corporations may also, in certain circumstances, pay income taxes on untaxed profits that were generated when the corporation operated as a C corporation. This is very common with uncollected accounts receivable or appreciated real estate. For example, if an S corporation that was formerly a C corporation sells an appreciated asset (such as real estate) and the appreciation occurred during the time the corporation was a C corporation, the S corporation will probably pay C corporation taxes on the appreciation‚Äîeven though the corporation is now an S corporation. This Built In Gain (BIG) tax rate is 35% on the appreciated property, but is only realized if the BIG property is sold within 10 years (starting from the first day of the first tax year of conversion to S-Corp status.) The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 reduced that 10-year recognition period to 7 years (if that 7th year precedes either 2009 or 2010.) The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 further reduced the recognition period to 5 years. =Federal tax=Taxable Income to Shareholders If a shareholder owns more than 2% of the outstanding stock, amounts paid for group health insurance for that shareholder are included on their W-2 as \\"wages.\\" The same applies to amounts contributed to Health Savings Accounts (HSA). Filing Form 1120S Form 1120S generally must be filed by March 15 of the year immediately following the calendar year covered by the return or, if a fiscal year (a year ending on the last day of a month other than December) is used, by the 15th day of the third month immediately following the last day of the fiscal year. The corporation must complete a Schedule K-1 for each person who was a shareholder at any time during the tax year and file it with the IRS along with Form 1120S. The second copy of the Schedule K-1 must be mailed to the shareholder. FICA As is the case for any other corporation, the FICA tax is imposed only with respect to employee wages and not on distributive shares of shareholders. Although FICA tax is not owed on distributive shares, the IRS and equivalent state revenue agencies may recategorize distributions paid to shareholder-employees as wages if shareholder-employees are not paid a reasonable wage for the services they perform in their positions within the company. Reporting compliance In 2005, the IRS launched a study to assess the reporting compliance of S corporations The study began in late 2005 and examined 5,000 randomly selected S corporation returns from tax years 2003 and 2004. The IRS intends to use the results to measure compliance in recording of income, deductions and credits from S corporations, and to formulate future audit criteria to better target likely non-compliant returns. This is part of a larger IRS effort to improve tax compliance and reduce the estimated $300 billion gap in gross reported figures each year. A large portion of that gap is thought to come from small businesses (and particularly S corporations, which are now the most common corporate entity, numbering over 4 million in 2011, up from 3 million in 2002 and about 750,000 in 1985). =State tax= States impose tax laws and regulations for corporate income and distributions, some of which may be directed specifically at S Corporations. Some but not all states recognize a state tax law equivalent to an S corporation, so that the S corporation in certain states may be treated the same way for state income tax purposes as it is treated for Federal purposes. A state taxing authority may require that a copy of the Form 1120S return be submitted to the state with the state income tax return. Some states such as New York and New Jersey require a separate state-level S election in order for the corporation to be treated, for state tax purposes, as an S corporation. California S corporations pay a franchise tax of 1.5% of net income in the state of California (minimum $800). This is one factor to be taken into consideration when choosing between a limited liability company and an S corporation in California. For highly profitable enterprises, the LLC franchise tax fees (minimum $800), which are based on gross revenues, may be lower than the 1.5% net income tax. Conversely, for high-gross-revenue, low- profit-margin businesses, the LLC franchise tax fees may exceed the S corporation net income tax. Delaware S Corporations operating in the City of Wilmington are not subject to the city's 1.25% net profits tax, however, S corporation employee wages are subject to the city's 1.25% wage tax. New York City In New York City, S corporations are subject to the full corporate income tax at an 8.85% rate. However, if the S corporation can demonstrate that a portion of its business was done outside the city, that portion will not be subject to the additional tax. Philadelphia In Philadelphia, S corporations are subject to the city's income tax (6.35%) and gross receipts tax (1.415%), but not the net profits tax (3.8907%). S corporations also benefit from Pennsylvania's flat personal income tax of 3.07% instead of the high corporation tax rate of 9.99%.

Produced by Dino De Laurentiis, starring Silvana Mangano, Raf Vallone, Doris Dowling and Vittorio Gassman, Bitter Rice was a commercial success in Europe and the United States. It was a product of the Italian neorealism style. The Italian title of the film is based on a pun; since the Italian word riso can mean either \\"rice\\" or \\"laughter\\", can be taken to mean either \\"bitter laughter\\" or \\"bitter rice\\". Although Bitter Rice did not win any awards, it was nominated for the 1950 Academy Award for Best Story and entered into the 1949 Cannes Film Festival. Production The film was shot on location in the countryside of Vercellese. The main locations are Tenuta Selve in Salasco and Cascina Veneria in Lignana. The film's sets were designed by the art director Carlo Egidi. Plot The film begins at the start of the rice-planting season in northern Italy. In an effort to escape the law, two small-time thieves, Francesca (Doris Dowling) and Walter (Vittorio Gassman), hide among the crowds of female workers heading to the rice paddies in the Province of Vercelli in the upper reaches of Piedmont in the Po Valley. While attempting to board the train for the fields, the pair runs into Silvana (Silvana Mangano), a peasant rice worker. Francesca boards the train with Silvana, who introduces her to the planters' way of life. Francesca does not have a work permit, and struggles with the other \\"illegals\\" to find a place on the rice fields. After initial resistance from documented workers and bosses, the illegals are allowed a place in the fields. At work in the fields, Silvana and Francesca meet a soon-to-be-discharged soldier, Marco (Raf Vallone), who unsuccessfully tries to attract Silvana's interest. Toward the end of the working season, Walter arrives at the rice farm and becomes involved in a plot to steal a large quantity of rice. Excited by his criminal lifestyle, Silvana becomes attracted to Walter. She causes a diversion to help him carry out the heist, but Francesca and Marco manage to stop Walter and his accomplices. Francesca and Silvana face each other, armed with hand-guns. Francesca confronts Silvana and explains that she has been heartlessly manipulated by Walter. In response, Silvana turns her gun on Walter and kills him. Soon afterwards, her guilt leads her to commit suicide. As the other rice workers depart, they pay tribute to her by sprinkling rice upon her body. Cast * Vittorio Gassman as Walter * Doris Dowling as Francesca (Italian voice: Andreina Pagnani) * Silvana Mangano as Silvana (Italian voice: Lydia Simoneschi; English dubbing: Bettina Dickson)Although Simoneschi voiced over Mangano's speaking lines, Mangano provided her own singing voice. * Raf Vallone as Marco * Checco Rissone as Aristide * Nico Pepe as Beppe * Adriana Sivieri as Celeste * Lia Corelli as Amelia * Maria Grazia Francia as Gabriella * Dedi Ristori as Anna * Anna Maestri as Irene * Mariemma Bardi as Gianna * Maria Capuzzo as Giulia * Isabella Zennaro as Rosa * Carlo Mazzarella as Gianetto Themes In the film, the character Silvana represents the allure of behavior modeled in American films, such as chewing gum and boogie-woogie dancing. Her downfall illustrates director Giuseppe De Santis's condemnation of these products of American capitalism.Gundle 2007, p. 143 In addition, Silvana was considered by many audiences to be overly sexualized. This sexualization and the melodramatic presence of death and suicide in the film cause it to diverge from typical Italian neorealism.Marcus 1986, p. 79 Awards and honors Bitter Rice was entered into the 1949 Cannes Film Festival. The film was nominated for Best Story in the 1950 Academy Awards. The film was also selected as one of 100 Italian films to be saved, a collection of films that \\"changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978\\". The collection was established by the Venice Film Festival in collaboration with Cinecitt√† and curated by Fabio Ferzetti, with input from Gianni Amelio and other Italian film critics. Many of the films selected represent the \\"Golden Age\\" of Italian cinema, which was manifested in the neorealist movement.

It has a black cap, blue-tinged wings, and a pale rufous belly and tail feathers, but its white bill distinguishes it very clearly from other kookaburras with their black bills. Juveniles, however, have a dark grey bill. Like the blue-winged kookaburra, the sexes can be distinguished by the colour of the tail feathers: blue in males and rufous in females and immature birds. Rufous-bellied kookaburras are smaller than other kookaburra species at around as against the laughing kookaburra's and about as against the laughing kookaburra's . Despite this major size difference, the rufous-bellied kookaburra has been known to form (infertile) hybrids with all other kookaburra species, though available genetic studies suggest it is clearly the most distant of the four. This kookaburra is unusual in that it occupies dense rainforests (as opposed to the open country preferred by other kookaburras) and does not live in cooperative breeding family groups but singly or when breeding in pairs. Rufous-bellied kookaburras can be found in the middle story of the tropical rainforest, where they fly out directly and swiftly from their perch to seize large insects from trees. Despite their direct flight, rufous- bellied kookaburras are capable of very sharp twists and turns around the dense trees that form their habitat. Rufous-bellied kookaburras have been known also to hunt small vertebrates, but do so less frequently than the larger woodland kookaburras, and frequently are mobbed by smaller birds when it preys on their eggs or nestlings. Males are very aggressive in defending their territory, which averages in size, and sometimes fight intruders violently. Skeleton Like their larger relatives, rufous-bellied kookaburras breed in termite mounds. Breeding usually takes place from May to October, though the young do not disperse fully until February and pairs have never been known to attempt a second brood in one year. Two white eggs are laid, though the actual incubation period is not known.

It is the 21st episode of the fourth season. In this episode, Captain Janeway must undergo a top secret mission to destroy an element called an \\"Omega Particle\\" that the Federation has deemed too dangerous to be allowed to exist. Plot Voyager is suddenly rocked by a distant explosion. Although ship systems appear undamaged, all information and control screens are suddenly locked and display an ominous omega symbol. Captain Janeway arrives on the bridge and instructs the crew not to worry. She orders the ship's computer to override the lockout and transfer all sensor data to her ready room, but leaves without explaining to her bemused crew what happened. After locking herself in her office she asks the computer to brief her on the detection of an object referred to as ‚ÄúOmega.‚Äù Janeway also summons Seven of Nine, an ex-Borg member of the crew, to her ready room, as the Borg have their own knowledge of ‚ÄúOmega.‚Äù Because Voyager has been separated from Starfleet, the Omega Team (a specially trained group which would normally be tasked with handling situations involving \\"Omega\\") cannot be brought in to deal with the problem. Janeway decides to break the code of silence involving the symbol and share information with her senior officers. She announces that a molecule hazardous to relativistic space travel, the Omega Particle, has been detected and she intends to follow the ‚ÄúOmega Directive,‚Äù an order that requires Starfleet captains to destroy Omega at all costs‚Äîeven the Prime Directive is null and void under such circumstances. As Janeway explains, Omega is unstable and even the explosion of one particle out in space can nullify subspace for many light years around it, rendering faster-than-light travel impossible within that area. Moving to the coordinates of the explosion they encounter the planet and its resident alien race that created it. The society is on the brink of economic failure and is making Omega particles to ‚Äúgive their children a chance at a future.‚Äù Seven of Nine displays an interest in the scientists' methods, however, hoping to save the Omega particles and harness them because she believes them to be perfection‚Äîinfinite parts working together as one (like the Borg)‚Äîdespite ample Starfleet and Borg evidence of their incredible danger: The Borg, referring to the Omega particle as ‚ÄúParticle 010,‚Äù are expected to assimilate it at all costs, even though they have experienced the loss of a large quantity of Borg vessels to Omega particle explosions while trying to harness the power of the substance. Seven notes, furthermore, that the ability to harness Omega would make the Borg a nigh-unstoppable force; this remark only strengthens the urgency and motivates Janeway to wipe out all Omega particles, at any cost, as determined by the Omega Directive. Eventually and through a series of issues and difficulties, all the particles are safely gathered together and detonated a safe distance from the alien planet. Just before they are destroyed, they inexplicably stabilize, and Seven is able to view perfection for 3.2 seconds, ‚Äúan eternity worth.‚Äù Critical reception Popular Mechanics reacted with derision to the concept of the Omega Particle, listing it as one of \\"6 Ridiculous Sci-Fi Energy Schemes\\" and describing it as a \\"ridiculous\\" deviation from the general Star Trek value of \\"mak[ing] its technobabble believable\\".

GM has the distinction of being the first probabilistic public-key encryption scheme which is provably secure under standard cryptographic assumptions. However, it is not an efficient cryptosystem, as ciphertexts may be several hundred times larger than the initial plaintext. To prove the security properties of the cryptosystem, Goldwasser and Micali proposed the widely used definition of semantic security. Basis The GM cryptosystem is semantically secure based on the assumed intractability of the quadratic residuosity problem modulo a composite N = pq where p, q are large primes. This assumption states that given (x, N) it is difficult to determine whether x is a quadratic residue modulo N (i.e., x = y2 mod N for some y), when the Jacobi symbol for x is +1. The quadratic residue problem is easily solved given the factorization of N, while new quadratic residues may be generated by any party, even without knowledge of this factorization. The GM cryptosystem leverages this asymmetry by encrypting individual plaintext bits as either random quadratic residues or non-residues modulo N, all with quadratic residue symbol +1. Recipients use the factorization of N as a secret key, and decrypt the message by testing the quadratic residuosity of the received ciphertext values. Because Goldwasser‚ÄìMicali produces a value of size approximately N to encrypt every single bit of a plaintext, GM encryption results in substantial ciphertext expansion. To prevent factorization attacks, it is recommended that N be several hundred bits or more. Thus, the scheme serves mainly as a proof of concept, and more efficient provably-secure schemes such as Elgamal have been developed since. Because encryption is performed using a probabilistic algorithm, a given plaintext may produce very different ciphertexts each time it is encrypted. This has significant advantages, as it prevents an adversary from recognizing intercepted messages by comparing them to a dictionary of known ciphertexts. Scheme definition Goldwasser‚ÄìMicali consists of three algorithms: a probabilistic key generation algorithm which produces a public and a private key, a probabilistic encryption algorithm, and a deterministic decryption algorithm. The scheme relies on deciding whether a given value x is a square mod N, given the factorization (p, q) of N. This can be accomplished using the following procedure: #Compute xp = x mod p, xq = x mod q. #If x_p^{(p-1)/2} \\\\equiv 1\\\\pmod{p} and x_q^{(q-1)/2} \\\\equiv 1\\\\pmod{q}, then x is a quadratic residue mod N. =Key generation= The modulus used in GM encryption is generated in the same manner as in the RSA cryptosystem. (See RSA, key generation for details.) #Alice generates two distinct large prime numbers p and q, randomly and independently of each other. #Alice computes N = p q. #She then finds some non-residue x such that the Legendre symbols satisfy \\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{p}\\\\right)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{q}\\\\right)=-1 and hence the Jacobi symbol \\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{N}\\\\right) is +1. The value x can for example be found by selecting random values and testing the two Legendre symbols. If p, q = 3 mod 4 (i.e., N is a Blum integer), then the value N ‚àí 1 is guaranteed to have the required property. The public key consists of (x, N). The secret key is the factorization (p, q). = Message encryption = Suppose Bob wishes to send a message m to Alice: #Bob first encodes m as a string of bits (m1, ..., mn). #For every bit m_i, Bob generates a random value y_i from the group of units modulo N, or \\\\gcd(y_i,N) = 1. He outputs the value c_i = y_i^2 x^{m_i}\\\\pmod{N}. Bob sends the ciphertext (c1, ..., cn). = Message decryption = Alice receives (c1, ..., cn). She can recover m using the following procedure: #For each i, using the prime factorization (p, q), Alice determines whether the value ci is a quadratic residue; if so, mi = 0, otherwise mi = 1. Alice outputs the message m = (m1, ..., mn). = Security properties = There is a simple reduction from breaking this cryptosystem to the problem of determining whether a random value modulo N with Jacobi symbol +1 is a quadratic residue. If an algorithm A breaks the cryptosystem, then to determine if a given value x is a quadratic residue modulo N, we test A to see if it can break the cryptosystem using (x,N) as a public key. If x is a non- residue, then A should work properly. However, if x is a residue, then every \\"ciphertext\\" will simply be a random quadratic residue, so A cannot be correct more than half of the time. Furthermore, this problem is random self- reducible, which ensures that for a given N, every public key is just as secure as every other public key. The GM cryptosystem has homomorphic properties, in the sense that if c0, c1 are the encryptions of bits m0, m1, then c0c1 mod N will be an encryption of m_0 \\\\oplus m_1. For this reason, the GM cryptosystem is sometimes used in more complex cryptographic primitives.

Characters *Beanish: an artist bean, who creates the \\"Fabulous Look‚Ä¢See‚Ä¢Show\\", artwork for the other beans to appreciate *Mr. Spook: the Beanworld hero initially rejected by Gran‚ÄôMa‚ÄôPa, who leads the Chow Sol'jer Army and performs heroic deeds. In addition, he is the leader of the Gunk'l'Dunk Gang. *Professor Garbanzo: an inventor/scientist bean who also functions as the Beans' primary manufacturer and supplier of tools and weapons. *Hoi-Polloi Ring Herd: inveterate gamblers, who use \\"chow\\" as money. During attacks by the Chow Sol‚Äôjer Army, the Hoi- Polloi shove their individual stores of chow into collective piles, then link arms with their neighbors in a circular formation to defend the chow. The Chow Sol'jer Army steals whatever portion of one ring herd's chow they can carry, and leave behind a \\"sprout-butt.\\" The Hoi-Polloi turn the sprout-butt into more chow, which they divide among themselves. The beans take the supply of chow back to their part of the Beanworld and consume it. *Gran‚ÄôMa‚ÄôPa: a large, mute, mostly immobile being resembling a tree which is the beans‚Äô spiritual guardian and physical parent. Among other things, Gran'ma'pa produces sprout- butts for the beans to take on Hoi-Polloi chow raids. *Boom‚ÄôR Band: three musician beans, who play tunes for the other beans to enjoy and dance to. Music and dance are both referred to as \\"boom'n.\\" In certain circumstances, their music can perform additional tasks, such as healing injured beans, and in the case of the band's rhythmist, in the curing stage of Gunk‚Äôl‚Äôdunk. *Pod‚ÄôlPool Cuties: Baby Beans. *Chow Sol‚Äôjer Army: beans which don‚Äôt have any other specific task form the Chow Sol‚Äôjer Army, who get chow from the Hoi- Polloi. The Army is divided into two squads: **Spear Fling‚Äôn Flank‚Äôrs: small elite squadron who wear special masks. They attack and painfully disable the Hoi-Polloi of a ring using spears formed from a Slat and a Chip. They are assisted in this by Mr. Spook and his Trusty Fork (and its successor weapon). **Chow Pluk‚Äôrs: they move in after the Spear Fling‚Äôn Flank‚Äôrs have done their job, grabbing the newly abandoned chow using Pluk‚Äôr Wands formed from a Slat and a Hoop. *Gunk‚Äôl‚ÄôDunk Gang: a small, semi-secret society within the Chow Sol‚Äôjer Army, whose function is to clean out the \\"gunk\\" from the bottom of the Chowdown Pool and process it into Gunk‚Äôl‚ÄôDunk, a useful adhesive. *Heyoka: A shamanistic bean, who does everything backwards, stands on his head, and falls upwards. Appropriated from the Lakotah Heyoka tradition, as is the beans' characteristic cheer of \\"hoka-hoka-hey\\". *Goofy Jerks: shiny wormlike beings from The Big‚Ä¢Big‚Ä¢Picture, with large heads, buck teeth, dark glasses, and hats (which illustrate their specific functions). Goofy Jerks usually travel in threesomes and perform specific functions stated by the second word in their name.The first ones seen in the series were the Goofy Service Jerks, which brought \\"Reproductive Propellant\\" to Gran‚ÄôMa\\"Pa, leading to the birth of the baby Pod‚ÄôlPool Cuties. Later in the series (but earlier in the continuity, via a flashback / historical tale) were seen a customer satisfaction research team (Goofy Survey Jerks), a medical squad (Goofy Surgical Jerks), and later in both the series and in continuity, a police squad (Goofy Surveillance Jerks). Their leader and judge is the enormous Goofy Sermon Jerk. *Dreamishness, a sun-like being (possibly the Beanworld's actual sun!) with whom Beanish has daily, secret colloquies. By dancing, he finds he can prolong the ecstatic moment when she pauses directly overhead. Dreamishness can't stand the Goofy Jerks, who refer to her as a \\"hot babe\\". Locations *Chowdown Pool: a large, communal facility which the Beans use for 'eating'. They mix chow taken from the Hoi-Polloi Ring Herd with water from the Thin Lake to produce 'soup'. The Bean community then enters the Pool and takes in nutrients through osmosis. *Legendary Edge: traditional exit point from the Beanworld, used when Beans wish to explore the Four Realities or hunt for chow. *Proverbial Sandy Beach: traditional re-entry point onto the Beanworld. *Thin Lake: relatively shallow but apparently endless layer of water that rests on top of the Four Realities. *Four Realities: strata of objects from which the Beans make virtually all of their possessions and structures. They are, in descending order, Slats (essentially lumber of various sizes), Hoops (exactly that), Twinks (five-pointed stars), and Chips (flat, triangular solids). *Bone Zone: During the first published Beanworld story, a processing ship invaded the Beanworld, containing four-armed corn kernels who were led by 'The Mirthful Mossy Mammoth and his Little Clone Son'. A significant number of Hoi-Polloi Ring Herd were murdered and 'processed' into 'Mossy Mammoth Luncheon Meats: Boiled in Butter!', leaving only their skulls. These skulls all collected in a stable 'level' below the Four Realities, although the Beans do not refer to this as an additional Reality. This level also established an additional distance for the Chow Sol'jer Army to travel in order to reach the Hoi-Polloi Ring Herd and the chow. *Der Stinkle: the lowest level of the Beanworld, literally beneath the notice of both the Beans and the Hoi-Polloi Ring Herd. Apparently analogous to compressed soil that is not quite as hard as sedimentary rock, as the inhabitants have created a vast network of tunnels through it. The author states on his blog that he meant Der Stinkle as a form of Xibalba. Der Stinkle is presumably uninhabited, as the insects (and their leader, Der Kveen) all abandoned it in search of the beans' surplus of 'mountain-grown chow'. Having eaten all the chow, Der Kveen laid thousands of \\"aigs\\", which the beans know as \\"mystery pods\\" and use for a variety of purposes. *The Big‚Ä¢Big‚Ä¢Picture: the greater universe of which the Beanworld is one small part. Mentioned briefly by the Goofy Service Jerks, and was partially explored by Heyoka in the final issue of the first run.

It operated from 1996 to 2012. History Michigan Brewing Company began operations in 1996 by owner Bobby Mason. Its original facility had previously been a large truck/semi repair shop located on the same property as the truck stop/gas station owned by Mason's father and mother. The facility was used until 2007 when brewery operations were moved a half mile away to its new facility. Over the course of the first three years the brewery struggled as it tried to gain brand recognition. Eventually it made strong inroads into the mid-Michigan market in part due to several medals won at different competitions including the annual Great American Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado. The Celis Brewing Company was purchased by Michigan Brewing in 2002. Pierre Celis, who is credited for the Wit beer revival in his native Belgium, and founded the Hoegaarden Brewery there and the Celis in Austin Texas, was hired to continue his famed style of beer which was just a false statement. Pierre Celis NEVER worked for Michigan not even as consultant! In 2006 the Michigan Brewing Company announced that a move into a larger facility, in order to stock more beer. Pub 122, the craft brewery's own pub, also moved and featured 16 beers on tap, more seating, and an expanded menu. The new facility is , which was about 7 times larger than the prior facility. The new factory, store and associated pub, plus an outdoor patio of 3,000-square-feet, made it \\"one of the largest breweries in Michigan. Second in distribution behind Kalamazoo's Bells Brewery . . .\\" In 2007, Michigan Brewing Company settled into a new building increasing capacity began setting up several projects. In partnership with Michigan State University, Michigan Brewing Company started producing biodiesel in the fully functional on-site lab and production facility in order to power the brewery's boilers. Plans were also in place to power the entire brewery's electricity needs from biodiesel generators. In 2007, the fifth anniversary of acquiring and continuing the legend of Celis, Michigan Brewing Company won a Gold Medal at the Great American Beer Festival for its Celis Grand Cru. This was the only Gold Medal acquired by Michigan breweries that year. The brewery also became a small distillery. =Eviction and possible move to Fenton= On April 24, 2012, the company was evicted from its Webberville headquarters. The property was foreclosed after the company failed to make loan payments. The 76,000 square foot property had been for sale for $1.65 million, and the company reported plans to rent the space, pending its move to Fenton, Michigan. The eviction followed an inability to come to terms with the new owner on a new lease. Michigan Brewing Company was slated to open a small brewery, restaurant and pub to a renovated Old Firehouse (Fenton, Michigan) in Fenton which was going to be leased/bought ($1 per year for seven years, plus taxes, then a $1.00 purchase) from the City Downtown Development Authority. Plans were to locate the brewery in the remodeled facility in Fenton, Michigan. General manager/brewer Bill Tadrick said the business is waiting on the architect to complete the plans. Notwithstanding the foreclosure and eviction, city officials expressed optimism that the relocation to Fenton would happen. Meetings to discuss the status of the fire hall lease were scheduled, but never happened. Unfortunately, due to the closing of the business in Webberville, the lease with Fenton was terminated under mutual agreement by both parties on April 26, 2012. Bobby Mason, owner and chief brewer, stated that the brewery was not entirely happy with the proposed arrangement, that they had been preoccupied with the eviction, and that it was for the best, even though half a year's worth of preparation was lost. Reports suggest the location was also being considered by Arbor Brewing Company. =MBC brewpub= MBC brewpub located in downtown Lansing is a separate entity, sells Michigan Brewing Company product (and also its own brewed on premises) and remains open. They intend to increase their own output. =Foreclosure= The Michigan Brewing Company was foreclosed upon and its assets sold at auction. All of its assets were sold, including the names and formulae of its beers. Among the assets was the Celis name, which had been acquired by Bobby Mason for Michigan Brewing in 2002. Sushil Tyagi, of Craftbev International Inc. represented the Celis family. He said, ‚ÄúI have been building a brewery with the Celis family ... We‚Äôve already been building the distribution network,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre making all the plans for marketing and branding. This (brand name repurchase) is just the one missing piece.‚Äù The financial failure was the latest part of a series of ongoing problems, including accounting, financing, creditor, and shareholder relations. Another example: at one point, manufacturing operations ceased and the pub was closed because of a failure to renew the liquor license. It is said that the ability to craft fine beer, like Pierre Celis did with Celis Brewing and Hoegaarden, is no guarantee of business acumen. One may be able to make great beer, but not have the right stuff to run a company that operates a brewery. As one critic observed: \\"Mason was like a lot of people running breweries: able to make great beers, but not so keen on finances. He apparently tried to keep the books himself, when a Financial Officer should have been brought in. And he was, like so many businessmen, caught short when a debtor [sic] called in its note, and found himself evicted from his own premises.\\" =Chapter 7 bankruptcy= In February 2013, brewer Bobby Mason took the company into Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. The Company had over $11 million in liabilities, and just over $50,000 in assets. Creditors and investors, including his parents, lost millions. Legacy BADASS beer that was developed with Kid Rock is now produced by Brew Detroit. BADASS beer reportedly accounted for half of Michigan Brewing Company's product.

It was founded with the intention of becoming a publishing house to begin printing and distributing the first six volumes of the Studies in the Scriptures series that were written directly by Charles Taze Russell which the Watchtower Society had officially ceased publishing in 1927.WTB&TS;, \\"God's Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached\\" (1973) page 347 In 1966, the Dawn published 'Oh, the Blessedness', a small booklet which rejected most of Russell's views of Bible prophecy and end time predictions resulting in numerous internal divisions.Oh, the Blessedness (1966) History In 1928 Norman Woodworth, following intense personal disagreement with the new policies of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and actions of the Society's President, Joseph Rutherford, left to create the radio program Frank and Ernest with the help of the Brooklyn congregation of Bible Students. He had previously been responsible for producing the same radio program for the Watchtower Society. In 1932, the Dawn Publishers, Inc. was founded in Brooklyn, New York, just blocks away from Watch Tower headquarters. In the 1940s it was moved to Rutherford, New Jersey under its current name, Dawn Bible Students Association. The Dawn was founded, by Woodworth and others, with the intention of becoming a publishing house to begin redistribution of the Studies in the Scriptures. Soon after starting the Frank and Ernest radio program a 4-page brochure entitled Bible Student's Radio Echo began to be printed in order to maintain public interest. Soon, its name was changed to The Dawn and Herald of Christ‚Äôs Presence magazine, and its size changed to 16-pages. It began as a bi-monthly, then later monthly, journal. Later history The Dawn Office in East Rutherford, New Jersey The Dawn was influential in regathering large numbers of the Bible Students who had ceased association with Watchtower Society between 1917 and 1928, sponsoring the \\"First Annual Reunion Convention of Bible Students\\" in 1929.Bible Student's Radio Echo vol. 1 no. 2 As a result, new congregations of Bible Students were formed in various countries worldwide and publishing their literature in various languages. In 1966 the Dawn published Oh, the Blessedness; a small booklet which rejected many of Russell's views on Bible prophecy and end times. This rejection polarized those Bible Students who still accepted Russell's views, and an independent movement was formed in 1974. Russell's Studies in the Scriptures as well as all other writings never before reproduced since his death were now being republished independently of the Dawn, alongside radio and television programs, journals, newsletters, books and booklets produced by various Bible Student individuals and congregations independent of the Dawn. As of 1992 all of Russell's writings, including printed sermons, speeches, newspaper and journal articles, tracts, letters and brochures have been reprinted and digitized. =Present day= Today the Dawn continue publication of Russell's Studies in the Scriptures, as well as booklets written by various Bible Students. They also produce radio and television programs. Current membership in America is difficult to estimate from the number of conventions.http://www.dawnbible.com/conv.htm In the late 1980s they had a membership of about 60,000.Pocket Dictionary of North American Denominations 2004 p79 ed. Drew Blankman, Todd Augustine \\"A smaller group rejected Rutherford's leadership and became the Dawn Bible Student's Association and in the late 1980s had a membership of about 60000. \\" In 2007 The Dawn Magazine 75th Anniversary 1932‚Äì2007The Dawn Magazine 75th Anniversary 1932‚Äì2007 gave a brief history of the group. Beliefs The Dawn Bible Students accept the inspiration and infallibility of the Bible. They accept Jesus as God's Son and Messiah, and believe in his pre-existent divine Sonship as the \\"Logos\\", but believe that the Father is greater.beliefs mp3s They teach Christ's ransom and blood atonement for mankind, and in a general resurrection. They also teach the existence of a literal fallen angel Satan, and other demons. The Dawn Bible Students teach the necessity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit for salvation and sanctification, but reject the doctrines of a co-equal Trinity, immortality of the soul, and a literal hell-fire. Studies in the Scriptures teaches two phases of the Kingdom of God - a spiritual phase, invisible, and an earthly phase. Oh, the Blessedness! in 1966\\"Only because these more than fifty years have passed since 1914 have our minds been expanded to see this more protracted and larger picture of the end of the world. addresses the two dates in Charles Taze Russell's prediction - the \\"beginning of the Master‚Äôs second presence\\" in 1874, and the \\"times of the Gentiles\\" end in 1914, recognising as did Russell himself in 1907M. James Penton Apocalypse delayed: the story of Jehovah's Witnesses p167 1997 \\"On this theme Russell expressed himself in 1907: But let us suppose a case far from our expectations: suppose that AD 1915 should pass with the world's affairs all serene and with evidence that the 'very elect' had not all been 'changed' and without the restoration of natural Israel to favor under the New Covenant. (Romans 11:12, 15) What then? Would not that prove our chronology wrong? Yes, surely! And would not that prove a keen disappointment? Indeed it would! It would work irreparable wreck to parallel dispensations and Israel's double, and to the Jubilee calculations, and to the prophecy of 2300 days of Daniel and to the epoch called 'Gentile Times,' and to 1,260, 1,290 and 1,335 days, ... none of these would be available longer. What a blow that would be! One, of the strings of our harp would be quite broken! However, dear friends, our harp would still have all the other strings in tune and that is what no other aggregation of God's people on earth could boast. (WTR 1907) and 1916\\"NOT ENDED: As we have noted, it was expected that the harvest would end in 1914. When, two years later, Brother Russell recognized that the harvest work was still in progress, he wrote: ‚ÄúSome of us were quite strongly convinced that the harvest would be ended by now, but our expectations must not be allowed to weigh anything against the facts.‚Äù‚ÄîR. 5950, par. 1 Later in the same article he wrote: ‚ÄúWe imagined that the harvest work of gathering the church would be accomplished before the end of the Gentile Times; but nothing in the Bible so said. Our thought was purely an inference, and now we see that it was an unjustified one.‚Äù‚ÄîR. 5950, last par.\\" that the predicted \\"foretold harvest\\" of saints did not end in 1914 and still is going on.

It was established on March 16, 1937 as a refuge and breeding ground for migratory and wintering waterfowl along the Atlantic Flyway. The Refuge was purchased from local land owners with federal duck stamp funds.USFWS History brochure. Today, the refuge protects wildlife of all kinds, with emphasis on all migratory birds. The refuge also contains the Allee House, a pre- revolutionary war farmhouse on the National Register of Historic Places. It is a stop on Delaware's Coastal Heritage Greenway. History Known to the Native American as Canaresse, meaning \\"at the thickets,\\" and later referred to as Ruyge-Bosje, meaning \\"shaggy bushes\\" or thicket, Bombay Hook received its final name from the corruption of the Dutch \\"Boompjes\\" or \\"Boompjes Hoeck\\" meaning \\"little-tree point.\\" In 1679 Mechacksett, chief of Kahansink sold Bombay Hook wetlands to Peter Bayard, an early Dutch settler. The price for the area was one gun, four handfuls of powder, three waistcoats, one anker of liquor,An anker was a measure of volume representing the volume held in a small cask holding around 45 bottles (see Anker). and one kettle. In 1682, a canal was built from the town of Smyrna to the Delaware Bay; this waterway became the Smyrna River. The Bombay Hook Lighthouse (also called the Smyrna River Lighthouse) was built by the US Government in 1831. The lighthouse was later automated in 1912 and an unmanned light was installed. Arsonists burned the abandoned structure in the early 1970s. The Allee House, still standing on the refuge, was built in 1753 by Abraham Allee, a Huguenot refugee from Artois, France. It is currently on the National Register of Historic Places. The house remains in nearly original condition. In 1848, a hotel was built on Bombay Hook Island, making the island a popular resort area. By 1870, the steamer Pilot Boy was making regular trips between Bombay Hook and Philadelphia. In 1878, a severe storm referred to by local residents as the \\"great tidal-wave\\" destroyed summer resorts on Collins and Fraland Beach. The storm changed the biological make-up of Bombay Hook. Prior to 1878, the inner marshes were protected from storms and high tides by the dunes and banks fronting the bay. These dunes were breached by the storm and were never repaired, the effects of which are evident to this day. Bombay Hook NWR wetlands In 1937, 12,000 acres (49 km¬≤), mostly tidal salt marsh stretching eight miles (13 km) along Delaware Bay, were purchased to establish the Bombay Hook Migratory Waterfowl Refuge. The land was purchased with duck stamp funds. On April 1, 1938, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) based at Leipsic, Delaware started work on the refuge. They cleared wooded swamps and built a dike to create Raymond and Shearness Pools and a causeway to separate Shearness and Finis Pools, creating three freshwater impoundments; they planted over fifty thousand trees; and they built a headquarters building, a boathouse and marine railway, an observation tower, and houses for the manager and a patrolman. They also ran ditches for mosquito control, and conducted various wildlife surveys. The camp ended March 18, 1942. In 1939, the Bombay Hook Migratory Waterfowl Refuge was renamed the Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge. During World War II the refuge was used as a gunnery range and for research on aerial rockets. In 1961, the fourth freshwater impoundment, Bear Swamp Pool, was added, making a total of 1,100 acres (4.5 km¬≤) of freshwater ponds that through techniques developed over the years are carefully managed to vary water levels for thousands of visiting waterfowl and shorebirds. In 1980, an Atlantic Beaked Whale beached at Bombay Hook. In 1986, Bombay Hook NWR represented the US in \\"World Safari\\" a satellite program by National Geographic, BBC, and Turner Broadcasting. Bombay Hook NWR was selected because of its high concentration of snow geese. In 2015, the Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge was featured on the fourth 2015 release of the America the Beautiful Quarters series. It features a great blue heron, with a great egret behind it, in a salt marsh. Small additions have been made to the refuge since 1937. The last occurred in 1993 when Bombay Hook NWR acquired Steamboat landing, bringing the total to 15,978 acres (64.66 km¬≤). Management of the refuge, including development of fifteen moist soil areas, about one thousand acres (4 km¬≤) of agricultural lands, warm season grass fields, and habitat diversity has significantly increased wildlife use of the refuge, particularly by bird populations. Topography Mudflats left behind by a receding tide at Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge Tidal salt marsh is some of the most valuable wildlife habitat in Delaware; thus large portions of the refuge have been maintained in a near pristine state. The marsh, with its intersecting tidal streams and rivers, provides excellent natural habitat for birds and mammals and serves as a nursery for marine organisms, and provides sporting or commercial value. The water levels in the refuge's impoundments are manipulated to produce desirable emergent and underwater plants for waterfowl. When the pools are drawn down, large populations of shore and wading birds feed on the mudflats. Upland agricultural crops are grown on about 1,100 acres (4.5 km¬≤) to provide additional food for waterfowl and other migratory birds. Wildlife and protected species Refuge management programs are primarily aimed at developing and protecting habitat for waterfowl and other migratory birds, including the threatened bald eagle. The refuge is a focal point for waterfowl migrating between their northern breeding grounds and southern wintering areas along the Atlantic Flyway. Large numbers of ducks and geese arrive each fall to spend the winter or to stopover as they head south. Delaware Bay is also the second largest staging area for spring migratory shorebirds in North America. The list of birds recorded at the refuge is very large, with nearly 350 species, including \\"accidental\\" migrants. As of 2009, eBird has recorded 302 species of birds in Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge.. 2009. eBird: An online database of bird distribution and abundance (web application). Version 2. eBird, Ithaca, New York. Available: . (Accessed: Apr. 16, 2009). Red fox at Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge The variety of habitats in the refuge provides food and cover for a number of other species. Thirty-five mammal species have been identified on the refuge; however, additional species native to the region probably are present but have not as yet been verified. Those most frequently seen, especially in the early morning and the late afternoon, are the cottontail rabbit, woodchuck, gray squirrel, red fox, and white-tailed deer. Other animals found in the refuge include salamanders, toads, frogs, turtles, lizards, and snakes. Other mammals that inhabit this refuge are beavers, muskrats, river otters, and opossums. In 1990, federal, state, and private organizations joined together to determine the status of horseshoe crabs. Volunteers surveyed Delaware Bay during peak spawning season in May and June. After 10 years of monitoring, restrictions on harvesting were implemented in 2000. Facilities Visitor facilities include a visitor center, auto tour route, observation towers and nature trails. There are opportunities for hiking, photography, and wildlife observation. Bear Swamp Trail and the visitor center are accessible to visitors with disabilities. A round-trip auto tour route and five nature trails ranging from 1‚ÅÑ4 to 1 mile (400 to 1600 m) in length, provide opportunities to observe and photograph wildlife. Three of the trails have 30-foot (10 m) observation towers. Public hunting, primarily for waterfowl and deer, is permitted under special regulations on portions of the refuge during the Delaware state season. The Allee House under repair in 2016 =Allee House= The Allee House stands as it did in the 18th century, and overlooks the fields and marshes of Kent County, Delaware. It is one of the best preserved examples of an early brick farmhouse in Delaware. The Allee House was built about 1753 by Abraham Allee, the son of John Allee. Abraham Allee served as a member of the Assembly in 1726, was appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1738, and was Chief Ranger for the county in 1749. The Allee House features fine brickwork laid in Flemish Bond with a few glazed header bricks. The interior of the house is distinguished by the handsome wood paneling of the parlor. The cornice in this room has a dentil course that is particularly well formed, and the splendid panels of the chimney breast are joined on either side by two striking recessed, arched china closets. These closets have paneled doors and graduated butterfly shelves against a barrel back with a fluted center post. Over the past 40 years, the house's walls and support beams have become damaged and weakened by water. Tours of the Allee House have been discontinued due to unsafe conditions related to sagging floors and chimney damage. =Port Mahon Lighthouse= Port Mahon, located at the southern boundary of the Refuge, was named after the capital of the Spanish island of Menorca. Built about 1890, Port Mahon included a blacksmith shop and a general store and was once the center of port activity in the Little Creek area. The lighthouse was built in 1903 and the lighthouse keeper tended the kerosene lamps faithfully. General supplies were brought in yearly when carts were able to carry them over the marsh-lined dirt road from Little Creek. All of the light station, with the exception of the support pilings, was destroyed by fire in 1984. =Bombay Hook Lighthouse= The Bombay Hook Lighthouse was constructed by the U.S. Government in 1829. In 1830, former Governor of Delaware Jacob Stout, laid out the road between Bombay Hook Lighthouse and Smyrna. In 1831, President Andrew Jackson and his Secretary of Treasury, Louis McLane appointed Duncan Stewart as the first keeper of Bombay Hook Lighthouse. In 1854, Duncan's daughter, Margaret Stewart, was appointed to her father's position as keeper upon his death that year at age 92. Four other keepers and their families lived and worked at this station, the last being Edward W. Long who was appointed April 11, 1912. In September 1912, the newly erected Smyrna River Range Lights came into service. These were a set of iron towers located in the mouth of the river displaying automated (unmanned) lights. Upon activation of the range lights, the Bombay Hook Lighthouse was considered obsolete and was \\"discontinued\\" at that time. The lighthouse sat abandoned and deteriorating for decades. In 1974, the Delaware State Division of Fish & Wildlife decided to demolish the lighthouse due to the hazard it evolved into over the years from vandalism and a series of fires.

The museum's permanent collection features paintings, photography, sculpture, and works on paper by leading artists working in the United States and its North American territories in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The greatest concentration of works falls into the period from the 1820s through the 1940s. Photographs, prints, and other works on paper produced up to the present day are also an area of strength in the museum's holdings. The collection is particularly focused on portrayals of the Old West by Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell, artworks depicting nineteenth-century exploration and settlement of the North American continent, and masterworks that are emblematic of major turning points in American art history. The \\"full spectrum\\" of American photography is documented by 45,000 exhibition-quality prints, dating from the earliest years of the medium to the present. A rotating selection of works from the permanent collection is on view year-round during regular museum hours, and several thousand of these works can be studied online using the Collection tab on the ACMAA's official website. Museum admission for all exhibits, including special exhibits, is free. The Amon Carter Museum of American Art opened in 1961 as the Amon Carter Museum of Western Art. The museum's original collection of more than 300 works of art by Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell was assembled by Fort Worth newspaper publisher and philanthropist Amon G. Carter, Sr. (1879‚Äì1955). Carter spent the last ten years of his life laying the legal, financial, and philosophical groundwork for the museum's creation. CollectionWestern art by Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell= Frederic Remington (1861‚Äì1909), An Indian Trapper, 1889Portrait photograph of Charles Marion Russell, ca. 1900 Over 400 works of art by Frederic Remington (1861‚Äì1909) and Charles M. Russell (1864‚Äì1926) form the ACMAA's core collection of art of the Old West. These holdings include drawings, illustrated letters, prints, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors produced by Remington and Russell during their lifetimes. More than sixty of the works by Remington and more than 250 of the works by Russell were purchased by the museum‚Äôs namesake, Amon G. Carter, Sr., over a twenty-year span beginning in 1935. Additions to Amon Carter‚Äôs original holdings by museum curators have resulted in a collection that contains multiple examples of Remington's and Russell's best work at every stage of their respective careers. Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell were America's best known and most influential western illustrators. Working from his New York studio except when traveling, Remington produced colorful and masculine images of life in the Old West that shaped public perceptions of the American frontier experience for an eastern audience eager for information. Montana resident Charles Russell, with his cowboy dress, laconic manner, and storytelling prowess, epitomized, in the early twentieth-century, the image of the Cowboy Artist in the eyes of the eastern press.Remington and Russell Gallery in the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, 2019Though neither artist had lived on the frontier at the height of America‚Äôs westward expansion, their drawings, paintings, and sculptures were infused with the action and convincing realism of direct observation. Russell moved to Montana Territory in 1880, nine years before statehood, and had worked as a cowboy for more than a decade before beginning his career as a professional artist. Remington toured Montana in 1881, later owned a sheep ranch in Kansas, and had traversed Arizona Territory in 1886 as an illustrator for Harper's Weekly. These and other experiences enabled both artists to convincingly portray a vast variety of Old West subject matter drawing on real world experiences, historical evidence, and their artistic imaginations. Noteworthy artworks in the ACMAA collection by Remington and Russell include: 1) Frederic Remington, A Dash for the Timber (1889; see gallery below) -- a work that established Remington as a serious painter when it was exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1889. 2) Frederic Remington, The Broncho Buster (1895) -- Remington's first attempt to model in bronze and the work that started him on a long secondary career as a sculptor. 3) Frederic Remington, The Fall of the Cowboy (1895) -- an evocation of the fading of the mythic cowboy of legend, anticipating Owen Wister's celebrated novel, The Virginian (1902). 4) Charles M. Russell, Medicine Man (1908) -- a detailed portrait of a Blackfeet shaman, reflecting Russell's empathy with Native American culture. 5) Charles M. Russell, Meat for Wild Men (1924) -- a bronze sculpture that evokes the \\"grand turmoil\\" resulting as a band of mounted hunters descends upon a herd of grazing buffalo. =Expeditionary art and depictions of Native American life= John Mix Stanley (1814‚Äì1872), Oregon City on the Willamette River, ca. 1852 The ACMAA houses a wide selection of maps and artworks by European and American documentary artists who, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, traveled the North American continent in search of new sights and discoveries. Some of these artists worked independently, focusing on subjects or areas of the country of their own choosing. Others served as documentarians on expeditions of continental discovery sent out by the U. S. government or by European sponsors. In these roles, artists were uniquely positioned to record the topography, animal and plant life, and diverse Indian culture of America and its frontiers. Finding and collecting drawings, oil paintings, watercolors, and published lithographs by these European and American documentary artists was one of the museum's earliest goals. Documentary artists represented in the collection include John James Audubon (1785‚Äì1851), Karl Bodmer (1809‚Äì1893), George Catlin (1796‚Äì1872), Charles Deas (1818‚Äì1867), Seth Eastman (1808‚Äì1875), Edward Everett (1818‚Äì1903), Francis Blackwell Mayer (1827‚Äì1899), Alfred Jacob Miller (1810‚Äì1874), Peter Moran (1841‚Äì1914), Thomas Moran (1837‚Äì1926), Peter Rindisbacher (1806‚Äì1834), John Mix Stanley (1814‚Äì1872), William Guy Wall (1792‚Äìafter 1864), Carl Wimar (1828‚Äì1862), and others. See Works on paper (below) for more information on American expeditionary art. =Landscape paintings and coastal scenes= Fitz Henry Lane (1804‚Äì1865), Boston Harbor, 1856 The Hudson River School, one of the critical movements in nineteenth- century American landscape painting, is an important focus of the ACMAA collection. Two major oils by Thomas Cole (1801‚Äì1848) and one by Cole‚Äôs prot√©g√© Frederic Edwin Church (1826‚Äì1900) anchor the museum‚Äôs holdings of signature Hudson River School paintings. The Narrows from Staten Island (1866‚Äì68), a panoramic depiction of Staten Island and New York Harbor by Jasper Francis Cropsey (1823‚Äì1900), is a notable example of the Hudson River School‚Äòs preoccupation with scenery along the Hudson River Valley and surrounding area (see picture gallery below). The Pre-Raphaelite movement, a British movement that was briefly influential among some artists of the Hudson River School in the mid-nineteenth century, is exemplified in Woodland Glade (1860) by William Trost Richards (1833‚Äì1905) and Hudson River, Above Catskill (1865) by Charles Herbert Moore (1840‚Äì1930). The Moore painting depicts an identifiable portion of the Hudson River adjacent to the home of Thomas Cole, making it likely that the painting was intended as a tribute to Cole. Hudson River School paintings that reflect the influence of Luminism are also found in the ACMAA collection. These include works by Sanford Robinson Gifford (1823‚Äì1880), Martin Johnson Heade (1819‚Äì1904), John Frederick Kensett (1816‚Äì1872), and Fitz Henry Lane (1804‚Äì1865). Given its \\"dark, brooding mystery,\\" the painting by Heade, Thunder Storm on Narragansett Bay (1868), is considered by many observers to be the artist‚Äôs masterpiece. Other Hudson River School artists represented in the collection by major oil paintings are Robert Seldon Duncanson (1821‚Äì1872), David Johnson (1827‚Äì1908), and Worthington Whittredge (1820‚Äì1910). William Stanley Haseltine (1835‚Äì1900) is represented by a preliminary study of rocky coastline along Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. The influence of the Hudson River School and Luminism was focused on a western United States location about 1870 when Albert Bierstadt (1830‚Äì1902) produced Sunrise, Yosemite Valley. This grandiose example of the artist‚Äôs work was completed after Bierstadt‚Äôs third trip to the American west. It was added to the ACMAA collection in 1966. Another Hudson River School painter who headed west was Thomas Moran (1837‚Äì1926). Moran, famous for his paintings of the Yellowstone region of Wyoming, is represented in the ACMAA collection by his 1874 oil Cliffs of Green River (see picture gallery below). =Figure paintings, portraits, and images of everyday life= Winslow Homer (1836‚Äì1910), Crossing the Pasture, 1871‚Äì72 Nineteenth-century figure paintings, portraits, and genre pictures (portrayals of everyday life) represent an important chapter in the history of American art development, and several examples of these types of paintings are found in the ACMAA collection. Swimming (1885) by Thomas Eakins (1844‚Äì1916) is one of the best- known realist figure paintings in the history of American art. A summation of Eakins‚Äô painting technique and belief system, Swimming was acquired for the ACMAA collection in 1990. Crossing the Pasture (1871‚Äì72) by Winslow Homer (acquired 1976) combines the artist‚Äôs skills as a figure painter with his gift for storytelling to create a charming image of rural New York life. Indian Group (1845) by Charles Deas (1818‚Äì1867) explores the physical appearance of Deas' Native American subjects and the perils associated with their nomadic lifestyle (see picture gallery below). The Potter (1889) by George de Forest Brush (1855‚Äì1941) is another example in the ACMAA collection of an artist's exacting and nuanced method of depicting an indigenous American sitter. Attention Company! (1878) by William M. Harnett (1848‚Äì1892) is the only known figural composition by this American master of trompe-l'≈ìil (\\"fool the eye\\") painting. A major historical genre painting by William T. Ranney (1813‚Äì1857) is in the ACMAA collection. Ranney‚Äôs Marion Crossing the Pedee (1850) exhibits the artist‚Äôs great skill as a figure painter and use of that skill to entertain and educate his nineteenth-century audience. Notable genre paintings by Conrad Wise Chapman (1842‚Äì1910), Francis William Edmonds (1806‚Äì1863), Thomas Hovenden (1840‚Äì1895), and Eastman Johnson (1824‚Äì1906) are also housed in the ACMAA collection. Portraitist John Singer Sargent (1856‚Äì1925) is represented in the museum‚Äôs collection by formal portraits of two American subjects, Alice Vanderbilt Shepard (1888), and Edwin Booth (1890; see picture gallery below). =Still-life paintings and sculpture= William J. McCloskey (1859‚Äì1941), Wrapped Oranges, 1889 Henry Kirke Brown (1814‚Äì1886), The Choosing of the Arrow, modeled 1848, cast 1849 Trompe-l'≈ìil (\\"fool the eye\\") paintings and classic still-life paintings make up a prominent component of the ACMAA collection. Ease (1887) by William M. Harnett (1848‚Äì1892) is a large and eloquent example of the trompe-l'≈ìil genre and one that amply demonstrates the allure of Harnett‚Äôs trompe-l'≈ìil illusions for his nineteenth-century patrons. John Frederick Peto (1854‚Äì1907), a William Harnett contemporary who worked in relative obscurity, is represented in the collection by two highly accomplished trompe-l'≈ìil compositions, Lamps of Other Days (1888) and A Closet Door (1904-06). Other trompe-l'≈ìil paintings in the ACMAA collection were created by De Scott Evans (1847‚Äì1898) and John Haberle (1853‚Äì1933). America‚Äôs first recognized still-life painter, Raphaelle Peale (1774‚Äì1825), is represented in the ACMAA collection by an 1813 composition Peaches and Grapes in a Chinese Export Basket. Other classic American still lifes featuring fruit or flowers include Wrapped Oranges (1889) by William J. McCloskey (1859‚Äì1941) and Abundance (after 1848) by Severin Roesen (1815‚Äìafter 1872). The ACMAA sculpture collection provides historical context for the museum‚Äôs deep holdings of bronze sculpture by Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell, as well as acknowledging the importance of sculpture in the wider history of American art. As such, the collection contains works created by leading individuals in both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Choosing of the Arrow (1849) by Henry Kirke Brown (1814‚Äì1886) is one of the earliest bronzes cast in America. Slightly later bronze sculptures, The Indian Hunter (1857‚Äì59) and The Freedman (1863), both by John Quincy Adams Ward (1830‚Äì1910), are also in the collection. Bust of a Greek Slave (after 1846) by Hiram Powers (1805‚Äì1873) is an example of an American neoclassical work carved in marble. Two American sculptors who enjoyed great success during their lifetimes, Frederick MacMonnies (1863‚Äì1937) and Augustus Saint-Gaudens (1848‚Äì1907), are represented in the ACMAA collection by cast bronze works created in the late nineteenth century. Alexander Phimister Proctor (1860‚Äì1950) and Anna Hyatt Huntington (1876‚Äì1973) are represented by bronzes created in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries respectively. A bronze sculpture by Solon Borglum (1868‚Äì1922), who, like Remington and Russell, specialized in depictions of Old West subjects, and a two-piece bronze by Paul Manship (1885‚Äì1966), Indian Hunter and Pronghorn Antelope (1914), are in the collection as well. The experimentation of early twentieth-century artists with nature-based abstraction and direct carving techniques from natural materials is seen in works by John Flannagan (1895‚Äì1942), Robert Laurent (1890‚Äì1970), and Elie Nadelman (1882‚Äì1946). Signature works by Alexander Calder (1898‚Äì1976) and Louise Nevelson (1899‚Äì1988) are among the mid-twentieth century sculptural pieces in the collection. Nevelson‚Äôs Lunar Landscape is a large, painted-wood construction that dates to 1959-60 (see picture gallery below). =American Impressionist paintings and 20th-century modernist works= Childe Hassam (1859‚Äì1935), Flags on the Waldorf, 1916 Charles Demuth (1883‚Äì1935), Chimney and Water Tower, 1931 The ACMAA collection contains several examples of American Impressionism. Idle Hours (about 1894) by William Merritt Chase (1849‚Äì1916) anchors the ACMAA holdings of American Impressionist paintings. Chase's student and prot√©g√© Julian Onderdonk (1882‚Äì1922) is represented by a Texas scene, A Cloudy Day, Bluebonnets near San Antonio, Texas (1918). Flags on the Waldorf (1916) is a signature New York work by Childe Hassam (1859‚Äì1935). Other well-known American Impressionist painters who have pieces in the collection are Mary Cassatt (1844‚Äì1926), Willard Metcalf (1858‚Äì1925), and Dennis Miller Bunker (1861‚Äì1890; see picture gallery below). New York photographer Alfred Stieglitz (1864‚Äì1946) befriended and championed several of the most visionary modern painters to emerge in early twentieth-century America. Five modern artists who were closely identified with Stieglitz's circle are represented in the ACMAA collection. They are Charles Demuth (1883‚Äì1935), Arthur G. Dove (1880‚Äì1946), Marsden Hartley (1877‚Äì1943), John Marin (1870‚Äì1953), and Georgia O'Keeffe (1887‚Äì1986). The collection houses early works by Demuth, Dove, Hartley, and O‚ÄôKeeffe, produced between 1908 and 1918, and a focused group of later paintings by Dove, Hartley, Marin, and O‚ÄôKeeffe that capture their response to the light and color of the New Mexican landscape near Taos. Charles Demuth‚Äôs Chimney and Water Tower (1931), painted in the artist‚Äôs hometown of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, depicts a local linoleum factory as a grid of austere, monumental forms and passages of steel gray, blue, and deep red. Chimney and Water Tower entered the ACMAA collection in 1995. Several important paintings by American modernist Stuart Davis (1892‚Äì1964) are housed in the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, including an early self-portrait painted in 1912 and a work from his Egg Beater series, Egg Beater No. 2 (1928). American modernists represented in the AMCAA collection also include Josef Albers (1888‚Äì1976), Will Barnet (1911‚Äì2012), Oscar Bluemner (1867‚Äì1938), Morton Schamberg (1881‚Äì1918), Ben Shahn (1898‚Äì1969), Charles Sheeler (1883‚Äì1965), Joseph Stella (1877‚Äì1946), and others (see picture gallery below). =Photography= Laura Gilpin (1891‚Äì1979), The Church at Picuris Pueblo, New Mexico, 1963 The Amon Carter Museum of American Art is one of the country‚Äôs major repositories for historical and fine art photographs. The ACMAA has over 350,000 photographic works in its collection, including 45,000 exhibition-quality prints. These holdings span the complete history of photographic processes used in America from daguerreotypes to digital. Photography‚Äôs central role in documenting American culture and history, and the medium's evolution as a significant and influential art form in the twentieth-century to the present, are the themes around which the ACMAA photography collection is organized. The personal archives of photographers Carlotta Corpron (1901‚Äì1988), Nell Dorr (1893‚Äì1988), Laura Gilpin (1891‚Äì1979), Eliot Porter (1901‚Äì1990), Erwin E. Smith (1886‚Äì1947), and Karl Struss (1886‚Äì1981) are prominent collection resources. Finding aids and guides for these and other monographic collections are available online under the Collections/Photographs/Learn More tabs on the ACMAA website.William Henry Jackson (1843‚Äì1942), Ca√±on of the Rio Las Animas, 1882The ACMAA photography collection contains early images of Americans at war, anchored by 55 Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1847‚Äì1848) daguerreotypes. The collection houses a copy of Alexander Gardner‚Äôs two-volume work, Gardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the Civil War and a copy of Photographic Views of Sherman‚Äôs Campaign (1865) by George Barnard. A group of more than 1,400 nineteenth and early twentieth-century portraits of Native Americans that originated with the Bureau of American Ethnology is another of the collection‚Äôs highlights, along with a complete set of Edward Curtis's The North American Indian. The ACMAA‚Äôs collection of nineteenth-century landscape photographs includes images by John K. Hillers (1843‚Äì1925), William Henry Jackson (1843‚Äì1942), Timothy H. O'Sullivan (1840‚Äì1882), Andrew J. Russell (1830‚Äì1902), and Carleton E. Watkins (1829‚Äì1916). Twentieth-century master images by Ansel Adams (1902‚Äì1984) are complemented by later twentieth-century landscapes from the studios of William Clift (b. 1944), Frank Gohlke (b. 1942), and Mark Klett (b. 1952). Fine art photographs by Alfred Stieglitz (1864‚Äì1946) are the collection's most significant works from the turn-of-the- twentieth-century Photo-Secession movement, a crusade which Stieglitz led. The work of the Photo-Secessionists and other leading photographers of the period is also documented in complete runs of Camera Notes (published 1897-1903), Camera Work (published 1903-1917), and 291 (published 1915-1916). Substantive holdings of twentieth-century documentary photographs include works by Berenice Abbott (1898‚Äì1991); prints produced over twenty-five years in connection with Dorothea Lange's The American Country Woman photographic essay; Texas images from the Standard Oil of New Jersey Collection; and project photographs from the 1986 statewide survey Contemporary Texas: A Photographic Portrait. Additionally, twentieth-century documentary photographs by Russell Lee (1903‚Äì1986), Arthur Rothstein (1915‚Äì1985), Marion Post Wolcott (1910‚Äì1990), and many others are housed in the museum's collection. Other substantive groups of twentieth-century photographs in the ACMAA collection are organized around the careers of Robert Adams (b. 1937), Barbara Crane (b. 1928), Frank Gohlke (b. 1942), Robert Glenn Ketchum (b. 1947), Clara Sipprell (1885‚Äì1975), Brett Weston (1911‚Äì1993), and Edward Weston (1886‚Äì1958). The ACMAA owns a complete set of prints from Richard Avedon‚Äôs In the American West series, a project commissioned by the ACMAA in 1979. In recent years the museum has largely focused on acquiring and displaying photographs by contemporary artists including Dawoud Bey (b. 1953), Sharon Core (b. 1965), Katy Grannan (b. 1969), Todd Hido (b. 1968), Alex Prager (b. 1979), Mark Ruwedel (b. 1954), and Larry Sultan (1946‚Äì2009). =Works on paper= John Mix Stanley (1814‚Äì1872), The Young Chief Uncas, 1869 Much of America‚Äôs aesthetic, economic, and social history is found in works on paper, a category that includes drawings, prints, and watercolors. The ACMAA began to actively collect works on paper in 1967. The collection today numbers several thousand items by noted artists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to the present. Drawings and paintings range from preliminary studies to fully realized compositions. Most nineteenth-century prints originated as reproductions intended for dissemination to the public and depict subjects relevant to the American experience. Twentieth-century and later prints are fine art prints made by a variety of processes as a means of artistic self- expression. Prints that stem from early western surveys conducted by the United States War Department and the United States Department of the Interior are important components of the works on paper collection. These prints were typically based on field sketches by artists who accompanied the expeditions. They provide unique views of the western landscape, Indian life, natural history, ancient Spanish culture, and life in nineteenth-century American frontier communities. The Fr√©mont Expeditions (1842‚Äì44), Emory Expedition (1846‚Äì47), Abert Expedition (1846‚Äì47), and Simpson Expedition (1849) are among the sources of western survey prints collected by the ACMAA. The ACMAA‚Äôs nineteenth-century print collection also includes a copy of the landmark Hudson River Portfolio (1821‚Äì25) based on the work of painter William Guy Wall (1792‚Äìafter 1864) and engraver John Hill (1770‚Äì1850); original copper plate etchings of Native Americans as depicted in field studies by Karl Bodmer (1809‚Äì1893); a complete set of planographic prints from George Catlin‚Äôs North American Indian Portfolio (1844); and ornithological prints from John James Audubon‚Äôs landmark book The Birds of America (published 1827-38).Henry Roderick Newman (1843‚Äì1917), Anemones, 1876Examples of work in the collection by other noted expeditionary artists include rare nineteenth-century field studies by Edward Everett (1818‚Äì1903), Richard H. Kern (1821‚Äì1853), John H. B. Latrobe (1803‚Äì1891), Alfred Jacob Miller (1810‚Äì1874), and Peter Rindisbacher (1806‚Äì1834); nineteenth-century views of the American West by John Mix Stanley (1814‚Äì1872) and Henry Warre (1819‚Äì1898); and early views of San Francisco by Thomas A. Ayres (1816‚Äì1858). See Expeditionary art and depictions of Native American life (above) for more information on American expeditionary art and artists. Preeminent American artists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries like Winslow Homer (1836‚Äì1910), George Inness (1825‚Äì1894), John La Farge (1835‚Äì1910), and famed expatriates John Singer Sargent (1856‚Äì1925) and James Abbott McNeill Whistler (1834‚Äì1903) are each represented by high-quality drawings and/or paintings in the ACMAA works on paper collection. Other artists in the works on paper collection who are associated with major movements in American art include American Pre-Raphaelites Fidelia Bridges (1834‚Äì1923), Henry Farrer (1844‚Äì1903), John Henry Hill (1839‚Äì1922), Henry Roderick Newman (1833‚Äì1918), and William Trost Richards (1833‚Äì1905); Ashcan School illustrator John Sloan (1871‚Äì1951); and leading twentieth- century modernists Charles Demuth (1883‚Äì1935), Arthur Dove (1880‚Äì1946), John Marin (1870‚Äì1953), Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe (1887‚Äì1986), Morton Livingston Schamberg (1881‚Äì1918), and Abraham Walkowitz (1878‚Äì1965). A master set of over 200 lithographs by American realist painter George Wesley Bellows (1882‚Äì1925) is one of the highlights of the ACMAA‚Äôs works on paper collection. Leading American printmakers Martin Lewis (1881‚Äì1962), Louis Lozowick (1892-1973), and Reginald Marsh (1898-1954) are each represented by multiple examples of their graphic work. Also housed in the collection are early works by Edward Hopper (1882‚Äì1967) and a complete set of prints by modernist Stuart Davis (1892‚Äì1964). An early watercolor by Jacob Lawrence (1917‚Äì2000), acquired in 1987, marks the ascension of this important artist‚Äôs career. The ACMAA collection houses almost 2,500 fine art lithographs made at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop in Los Angeles, California between 1960 and 1978. The museum also houses an important collection of drawings, watercolors, and prints by early Texas artist Bror Utter (1913‚Äì1993), including Utter‚Äôs 1957-58 studies of vanishing Fort Worth architecture. Most recently, the ACMAA added two important series of lithographs to these holdings, one by Glenn Ligon (b. 1960) and another by Sedrick Huckaby (b. 1975). Library and archives The ACMAA library is a 150,000 item art reference library available for use by museum curators, researchers, and interested members of the public. The library provides access to a 50,000 book collection, augmented by related collections of microform, periodicals and journals, auction catalogs, and ephemera. The library‚Äôs holdings are non-circulating and organized around the study of American art, photography, and culture from Colonial times to the present, with an emphasis on materials that enhance understanding of objects in the museum‚Äôs permanent art collection and the milieu in which these objects were created. The ACMAA library‚Äôs microform holdings include 14,000 microfilm reels of nineteenth-century newspapers, periodicals, books, and other primary material. These holdings also include more than 50,000 microfiches of auction and exhibition catalogues, ephemera, and other material. Specific microform sets include the Knoedler Library on Microfiche (art auction and exhibition catalogs), New York Public Library Artists File, New York Public Library Print File, and America, 1935-1946 (photographs from the Farm Security Administration and the Office of War Information in the Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress). The Amon Carter Museum of American Art is the mid-country research affiliate of the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. In this role, the ACMAA library offers access to 7,500 microfilm reels of unrestricted material from the Archives of American Art representing about fifteen-million primary, unpublished documents related to American artists, galleries, and collectors.leftthumb275x275pxAlexander Wilson (1766‚Äì1813), Blue Jay, Yellow Bird or Goldfinch, Baltimore Bird, American Ornithology - Plate 1, published 1809‚Äì14 The library‚Äôs Vertical File/Ephemera collection contains a wide variety of loose material and small publications on artists, museums, commercial galleries, and other art organizations. Included in this collection are biographical files, arranged by name, with coverage of about 9,000 artists, photographers, and collectors. These biographical files offer researchers a wealth of newspaper clippings, small exhibition catalogs, resumes, journal and periodical articles, reproductions, event invitations and announcements, portfolios, bibliographies, and similar material from which to draw. The ACMAA library houses a number of rare illustrated books. These titles are useful for their textual information and valuable as works of art for their original prints. Among the illustrated books in the library collection are American Ornithology, or, the Natural History of the Birds of the United States (Philadelphia: Bradford and Inskeep, 1809‚Äì14), the first bird book published in the United States and the first outstanding American color plate book; and The Aboriginal Port-folio (Philadelphia: J.O. Lewis, 1835‚Äì36), the first color plate book published on the North American Indian. Other illustrated books owned by the library are highlighted under the Collection tab on the ACMAA website, and many of the illustrations within these books are digitized and searchable. The museum archives contain private papers and records originating from individuals, usually artists or photographers, that are often integrally connected to the museum's art collection. Among these records are the personal archives of photographers Laura Gilpin (1891‚Äì1979), Eliot Porter (1901‚Äì1990), and Karl Struss (1886‚Äì1981). The archives also house the business records of the Roman Bronze Works (est. 1897-closed 1988) of Queens, New York, long one of America‚Äôs premier art bronze foundries, and a range of documents related to the ACMAA's institutional history. In 1996, the ACMAA library partnered with the libraries of the Kimbell Art Museum and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth to create the Cultural District Library Consortium (CDLC). The purpose of the consortium was to explore new ways of sharing the resources of the three Fort Worth institutions via online public access. In 1998, with technical assistance from the library at Texas Christian University, the three museums launched an online CDLC catalog that allows website visitors access to the combined collections of all three art museum libraries. Today, the CDLC catalog also gives access to the libraries of the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame, and the Botanical Research Institute of Texas (BRIT). To search the ACMAA library holdings, click Search the ACMAA Library Catalog in the External links section (below). Professional assistance and access to items in the Amon Carter Museum of American Art library is provided in the library reading room during the stated hours of operation. More information is available under the Library tab on the ACMAA website. History Amon G. Carter, Sr. as a young newspaperman and entrepreneur in Fort Worth, ca. 1910 An admission-free museum of western art was conceived by Amon G. Carter, Sr. (1879‚Äì1955), publisher of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, a large-circulation, daily newspaper in Fort Worth, Texas. Carter and his wife, Nenetta Burton Carter, took a key step toward the museum‚Äôs creation in 1945 when the Amon G. Carter Foundation, a Texas non-profit foundation, was formed, and the Carters transferred much of their wealth into it for the purpose of providing seed money to support an array of civic causes. At the time the foundation was incorporated, Amon Carter had been actively collecting art by Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell for a decade. On October 3, 1950, Carter informed the City of Fort Worth of his intention to \\"erect and equip\\" a museum and present it to the city. In 1951, the Amon G. Carter Foundation purchased a portion of the museum‚Äôs future site to protect the land from commercial encroachment. Following Amon Carter‚Äôs death in June 1955, his last will and testament empowered the foundation to provide for a museum to house his art collection and \\"be operated as a nonprofit artistic enterprise for the benefit of the public and to aid in the promotion of the cultural spirit in the city of Fort Worth and vicinity, to stimulate the artistic imagination among young people residing there.\\" A chance meeting between Amon Carter‚Äôs daughter and New Yorker Philip C. Johnson (1906-2005) at a Houston dinner party led to the commissioning of Johnson as the future museum‚Äôs lead architect. Ruth Carter Stevenson (who was Ruth Carter Johnson at the time and no relation to the architect) had assumed the role of project manager for the new museum and was in a position to offer Philip Johnson the job. In February 1959, the City of Fort Worth and the Amon G. Carter Foundation entered into a contract for the creation of a museum of western art, with the city providing the remainder of the land needed to build the museum. Construction began in 1960, and the Amon Carter Museum of Western Art opened to the public on January 21, 1961 (see building history below). Raymond T. Entenmann, director of the Fort Worth Art Center, served as the Amon Carter‚Äôs acting administrator during the museum‚Äôs early months. Mitchell A. Wilder (1913-1979), a seasoned museum director working in Los Angeles, arrived in August 1961 to begin work as the museum‚Äôs director. The museum‚Äôs articles of incorporation and bylaws were adopted in the fall of 1961, and a Board of Trustees was appointed. In their early discussions, Wilder and the board decided that the museum‚Äôs programs and permanent collection should reflect many aspects of American culture, both historic and contemporary. This decision paved the way for an expansion of the permanent collection that first focused on acquiring American art from the nineteenth-century and, later, the twentieth. Under Wilder‚Äôs guidance, the museum collected heavily in the areas of nineteenth-century American art and photography. Wilder also established an academic publishing presence and built a record of organizing groundbreaking exhibitions. The museum published Paper Talk: The Illustrated Letters of Charles M. Russell in 1962, the first of many books on the art of the American West to originate from the Amon Carter. In 1966, Wilder reintroduced the paintings of Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe (1887‚Äì1986) to the nation by organizing a ninety-five piece retrospective of her work. The following year, 1967, American Art‚Äì20th Century: Image to Abstraction brought more than one hundred paintings by America‚Äôs leading early modernists to Fort Worth from New York. Blips and Ifs (1963‚Äì64), the final painting by Stuart Davis (1892‚Äì1964), was acquired for the museum from this exhibition, signaling a fundamental redefinition of the museum‚Äôs collecting scope. Mitchell Wilder‚Äôs embrace of the museum‚Äôs collecting mandate led to two building expansions during his tenure, including a major addition in 1977 that doubled the size of the museum (see building history below). Main entrance to the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, constructed 1961. Glass panels and museum entry doors renovated 2015. Mitchell Wilder died in 1979 after a brief illness. Four other directors have headed the museum in the years since. They are Jan Keene Muhlert (1980‚Äì95), Dr. Rick Stewart (1995‚Äì2005), Dr. Ron Tyler (2006‚Äì11), and Dr. Andrew J. Walker (2011‚Äìpresent). Each worked closely with Amon Carter‚Äôs daughter, Ruth Carter Stevenson (1923‚Äì2013), in determining the museum‚Äôs course. Stevenson had spent the final years of her father's life in conversation with him about his concepts for a museum and the role it should play in Fort Worth civic life. It was this familiarity with his vision, and her extraordinarily high standards, that would bring Stevenson into a leading role in the museum‚Äôs development. Jan Keene Muhlert oversaw an aggressive acquisitions program that brought works by William Merritt Chase (1849‚Äì1916), Thomas Cole (1801‚Äì1848), Arthur Dove (1880‚Äì1946), Childe Hassam (1859‚Äì1935), and David Johnson (1827‚Äì1908) into the collection, crowned by the acquisition in 1990 of Swimming by Thomas Eakins (1844‚Äì1916). The purchase of the Eakins masterpiece required a capital campaign to raise ten million dollars and drew on every resource available to Muhlert. Dr. Rick Stewart, Muhlert‚Äôs successor, is a nationally recognized scholar on the work of Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell. During his tenure as director, Dr. Stewart added major works to the museum‚Äôs collection by Stuart Davis (1892‚Äì1964), Marsden Hartley (1877‚Äì1943), and John Singer Sargent (1856‚Äì1925). Stewart oversaw the challenging, two-year closure during which two previous expansions and the museum‚Äôs physical plant were demolished. In their place a much larger facility was erected, culminating in a grand reopening in 2001. When Dr. Stewart stepped down as director, he was named the museum‚Äôs senior curator of western painting and sculpture. Dr. Ron Tyler returned to the Amon Carter in 2006 as director. (Dr. Tyler began his museum career at the museum from 1969 to 1986.) During his tenure as director, the museum presented major exhibitions of the work of Alfred Jacob Miller (1810‚Äì1874) and William Ranney (1813‚Äì1857), and an important exhibition of African-American art from the private collection of Harmon and Harriet Kelley. Paintings by George de Forest Brush (1855‚Äì1941) and Charles Sheeler (1883‚Äì1965), as well as a complete, 20-volume set of Edward Sheriff Curtis‚Äô The North American Indian (1907‚Äì1930), were added to the museum‚Äôs permanent collection during Dr. Tyler‚Äôs administration. Dr. Andrew J. Walker has led the Amon Carter since 2011. Under Dr. Walker's leadership, the ACMAA has hosted major exhibitions of work by George Caleb Bingham (1811‚Äì1879), Will Barnet (1911‚Äì2012), and the circle of New York modernists led by artist John Graham (1886‚Äì1961). He has overseen additions to the permanent collection of works by Robert Seldon Duncanson (1821‚Äì1872), Raphaelle Peale (in memory of Ruth Carter Stevenson), and John Singer Sargent (1856‚Äì1925), and he initiated major upgrades to the museum‚Äôs digital presence, including the Connecting to Exhibitions digitization project, a two-year initiative that will allow online access to many of the museum‚Äôs previous art exhibitions. In 1977, on the occasion of the opening of the Philip Johnson- designed expansion, the Amon Carter Museum of Western Art became the Amon Carter Museum. In 2011, on the occasion of the museum‚Äôs 50th anniversary, the museum was renamed the Amon Carter Museum of American Art. Building Amon Carter Museum of American Art, main entry hall, constructed 1961 Shellstone used to clad the exterior of the 1961 building and portions of the museum's present-day interior Architect Philip C. Johnson (1906‚Äì2005) maintained a forty-year association with the Amon Carter Museum of American Art as the designer of the institution's original building and two major expansions. The Amon G. Carter Foundation first commissioned Johnson in 1958 to devise a museum building that would showcase a core collection of western art and also serve as a memorial to the museum's founder. At the time Johnson won this commission he was also overseeing construction of the new Munson-Williams- Proctor Arts Institute Museum of Art in Utica, New York. Johnson found the Carter museum project particularly inspiring because of the spectacular view from the proposed museum's building site on a gently sloping hillside overlooking downtown Fort Worth. Amon G. Carter, Sr. had personally chosen the site in 1951. Johnson placed the museum building as far up the hillside as possible in order to maximize this panoramic view to the east. Johnson designed a two-story portico with five arches that faced east toward the city's skyline. The arches and their tapered support columns were clad in creamy Texas shellstone. The remaining three sides of the 20,000-square-foot building were also covered with shellstone cladding. Sheltered by the arched portico, the museum's front wall consisted of a two-story curtain of glass windows with bronze mullions. Johnson identified Florence's Loggia dei Lanzi and Munich's Felderrnhalle as precedents for the \\"boxes with fronts\\" style portico. The main entrance lead directly into a two-story hall adorned with the same type of shellstone used on the exterior, teak wall coverings, and a floor of pink and gray granite. Beyond the main hall were five small galleries of equal size for the display of art. On the mezzanine level were five similar galleries, each with a balcony that overlooked the main hall. These mezzanine galleries served as library and office spaces. To take advantage of the expanse between the two-story portico and the site's eastern boundary, Johnson designed a series of broad steps and terraces extending away from the building, with an expansive sunken, grassy plaza as the centerpiece, pointing toward the city's center. The museum and grounds opened to the public on January 21, 1961, as the Amon Carter Museum of Western Art. Reaction by critics to Philip Johnson's design was generally favorable. In a March 1961 article, \\"Portico on a Plaza,\\" the Architectural Forum called it \\"an exceedingly handsome building -- beautifully situated and beautifully illuminated.\\" Russell Lynes, writing in the May 1961 Harper's, summed up his reaction by calling it \\"Mr. Johnson's jewel box.\\" Although the museum was conceived as a small memorial institution, it almost immediately became a collecting museum, and the space afforded by the existing facility quickly became inadequate. In 1964, three years after the museum first opened, a 14,250-square-foot addition was completed on the west side of the original building to provide room for offices, a bookstore, a research library, and an art-storage vault. Joseph R. Pelich (1894-1968) of Fort Worth, an associate architect of the original building, carried out the work after Philip Johnson expressed little interest in taking on the project. The museum opened a second major addition, this one designed by Philip Johnson and his partner, John Burgee, in 1977. The 1977 addition, which left the 1961 building and 1964 addition intact, expanded the museum's area by 36,600 square feet, more than doubling its original size. The expansion, which included a three-story section, enclosed the triangular space at the far western end of the building site, thus bringing the physical plant to its westernmost limit. Johnson's 1977 addition created an administrative wing, a 105-seat auditorium, a two- story storage vault, a spacious library, and two interior grassed courts that insulated occupants of the library and administrative offices from heavy traffic passing nearby. Amon Carter Museum of American Art, central atrium (the Lantern), constructed 2001 On November 17, 1998, museum trustees announced plans to expand the museum yet again. Museum personnel had been in discussion with Philip Johnson for some time regarding the need to alter Johnson's 1977 addition. Johnson's solution was to demolish both the 1964 and 1977 additions and create a new, much larger structure behind the 1961 building. Philip Johnson spearheaded the new design in collaboration with his partner Alan Ritchie. It would be one of the last projects on which Johnson worked. In August 1999 the museum was closed to the public for an extended period while the 1961 building was refurbished, the 1964 and 1977 additions were removed, and the new addition constructed. The current museum building reopened to the public on October 21, 2001. The 2001 expansion, which increased the museum's available space by 50,000 square feet, rests on the same footprint as the earlier additions. It is clad in dark Arabian granite so as to recede visually from the light-colored shellstone of the 1961 building. The expansion's most arresting feature is a centrally located atrium, rising fifty-five feet above the floor and topped by a curved roof with side windows, referred to as the Lantern. The atrium's interior walls are clad in the signature shellstone. A double stairway gives access from the atrium to a complex of second-floor galleries where selections from the museum's permanent collection, along with special exhibitions, are on display. In this new alignment, most of the galleries in the 1961 building, including the mezzanine area where the library and offices were once located, are used for rotating exhibitions of paintings and sculpture by Remington and Russell from Amon G. Carter's original collection. Other features of Philip Johnson's 2001 expansion include a 160-seat auditorium, complete with distance-learning technology; climate-controlled vaults for both cool and cold photography storage; laboratory space for the conservation of photographs and works on paper; a research library and archives storage facility; and a museum bookstore. In the summer of 2019, the museum building was closed for a renovation of the building and the galleries. The Boston-based architecture firm Schwartz/Silver Architects oversaw the renovations; unlike the 1977 and 2001 closures, there was little alteration to the museum building's structure. Instead, the museum redesigned parts of the interior arranging its collection display thematically rather than chronologically. The renovation expanded the display area by the installation of movable, modular walls. The gallery spaces, which had previously been carpeted, were replaced with American white oak hardwood floors. Following Johnson's original vision for expansive natural lighting, new LED and skylights were installed in the galleries. The installation of an automatic shading system enabled the display of artworks in the lobby. The Texas sculptor James Surls's Seven and Seven Flower and Justin Favela's Puente Nuevo were among the first large scale artworks displayed in the downstairs hallway connecting the 1961 building with the 2001 expansion as part of the redesign. The 2019 renovations received positive feedback from the local press. James Russell praised the redesigned galleries in the Fort Worth Weekly, noting that they created \\"an atmosphere for exploration.\\" Dallas Morning News architecture critic, Mark Lamster lamented that the redesign upended the original design's \\" juxtaposition of the grand formal entry with . . . those more intimate galleries,\\" but overall considered the renovated galleries \\"a big improvement.\\" In addition to the redesigned galleries, the photography cold storage vaults were renovated to accommodate the growing and collection and to provide updated preservation technologies. Fort Worth philanthropist Ed Bass helped to fund a Gentling Study Center located in the Museum Library dedicated to the artwork of Fort Worth brothers, Stuart W. and Scott G. Gentling. The creation of the Gentling Study Center complements the Amon Carter Museum's planned exhibitions and publications on the Gentling brothers. The Study Center's interior design mirrors the teak wall coverings and mid-century furniture that characterize Johnson's original design. Architecture critic, Mark Lamster singled out the Gentling Library for its \\"pleasingly midcentury gestalt.\\" More American art from the collection File:The art of colouring and painting landscapes in water colours - Plate 10.jpgPlate 10 from The art of colouring and painting landscapes in water colours, Baltimore: Fielding Lucas, 1815 File:Charles Deas A group of Sioux.jpgCharles Deas (1818‚Äì1867), Indian Group, 1845 File:P1999-13 s.jpgAlbert Sands Southworth (1811‚Äì1894) and Josiah Hawes (1818‚Äì1901), [Two women posed with a chair], ca. 1850 File:Victoria Regia - Intermediate Stages of Bloom - 1854.jpgWilliam Sharp (1803‚Äì1875), Victoria Regia - Intermediate Stages of Bloom, 1854 File:Mollhausen - Canadian River Near Camp 38.jpgHeinrich M√∂llhausen (1825‚Äì1905), Canadian River Near Camp 38, 1855 File:David Johnson Eagle Cliff Amon Carter Museum.jpgDavid Johnson (1827‚Äì1908), Eagle Cliff, Franconia Notch, New Hampshire, 1864 File:Martin Johnson Heade Marshfield Meadows Amon Carter Museum.jpgMartin Johnson Heade (1818‚Äì1904), Marshfield Meadows, Massachusetts, 1866‚Äì76 File:Jasper Francis Cropsey The Narrows from Staten Island Amon Carter Museum.jpgJasper Francis Cropsey (1823‚Äì1900), The Narrows from Staten Island, 1868 File:Robert Scott Duncanson - The Caves.jpgRobert Seldon Duncanson (1821‚Äì1872), The Caves, 1869 File:George Caleb Bingham View of Pikes Peak Amon Carter Museum.jpgGeorge Caleb Bingham (1811‚Äì1879), View of Pike's Peak, 1872 File:1975-28 s.jpgThomas Moran (1837‚Äì1926), Cliffs of Green River, 1874 File:Mary Cassatt - Woman Standing, Holding a Fan, 1878‚Äì79.jpgMary Cassatt (1844‚Äì1926), Woman Standing, Holding a Fan, 1878‚Äì79 File:1990-19-1 s.jpgThomas Eakins (1844‚Äì1916), Swimming, 1885 File:Dennis Miller Bunker In the Greenhouse Amon Carter Museum.jpgDennis Miller Bunker (1861‚Äì1890), In the Greenhouse, 1888 File:John Singer Sargent Alice Vanderbilt Shepard Amon Carter Museum.jpgJohn Singer Sargent (1856‚Äì1925), Alice Vanderbilt Shepard, 1888 File:2013-7 s.jpgJohn Singer Sargent (1856‚Äì1925), Edwin Booth, 1890 File:A Dash for the Timber; 1889, Frederic S.

She is one of the first three women to earn her wings as a Canadian Forces (C.F.) military pilot for active duty and also one of the first of two female CF-18 Hornet fighter pilots in the world. Born in Pembroke, Ontario, a daughter to Lieutenant Colonel (Retired) Lionel C. (Lyn) Brasseur and Marie Olive (Aucoin), she joined the Canadian Forces in 1972 as an administrative clerk at a dental unit detachment in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The following year, she was accepted for commissioning under the Officer Candidate training program. She graduated as an Air Weapons Controller in 1974. In 1979, she was accepted for pilot training. She along with Nora Bottomley and Leah Mosher graduated from Canadian Forces Flight Training School in Portage la Prairie. She received her wings in 1981. In 1988, she took fighter pilot training. In June 1989, following twelve months of training on Canadair CF-5 and McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet jet fighter aircraft, Brasseur and Captain Jane Foster (pilot) became the only two women in the world flying fighters in operational squadrons. Canada was the first country to allow women to fly in a combat role since the Second World War, when the Soviet Union used women pilots. Brasseur was promoted to major in 1989 and posted to National Defence Headquarters (Canada) in Ottawa at the Directorate of Flight Safety, in March 1990. She retired from the military in 1994 with 2,500 hours of jet flying. In 1998, a Maclean's cover story on sexual abuse in the Canadian Forces prompted Brasseur to go public with her own experiences. In the June 1 edition of the magazine, Brasseur claimed that throughout her 21-year career she faced unwanted sexual advances, was raped by her enlisted boyfriend and was coerced into having sex with her flight teacher. In 1998, she was made a Member of the Order of Canada. In 2007, she was inducted into the Women in Aviation, International Pioneer Hall of Fame.

A former station on the Oregon Trail, it became a ghost town after later gold mines were closed. The entire community is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The closest town is Atlantic City, Wyoming. Some people have moved back in.  History  South Pass City developed rapidly as a stage and telegraph station on the Oregon Trail during the 1850s. The site of the first settlement in the area was about south of present-day South Pass City, at what is today known as Burnt Ranch. Burnt Ranch was located where the Emigrant Trails crossed the Sweetwater River for the last time and ascended toward the South Pass. In August 1861, 25-year-old Samuel Clemens (later Mark Twain) passed through South Pass City via stagecoach with his brother Orion, newly appointed as Secretary of Nevada Territory. Mark Twain later wrote about the experience in Roughing It, first published in 1872: \\". . . we hove in sight of South Pass City. The hotelkeeper, the postmaster, the blacksmith, the mayor, the constable, the city marshal and the principal citizen and property holder, all came out and greeted us cheerily, and we gave him good day. He gave us a little Indian news, and a little Rocky Mountain news, and we gave him some Plains information in return. He then retired to his lonely grandeur and we climbed on up among the bristling peaks and the ragged clouds. South Pass City consisted of four log cabins, one of which was unfinished, and the gentleman with all those offices and titles was the chiefest of the ten citizens of the place. Think of hotelkeeper, postmaster, blacksmith, mayor, constable, city marshal and principal citizen all condensed into one person and crammed into one skin. [Fellow passenger] Bemis said he was 'a perfect Allen's revolver of dignities.' [The Allen was a small revolver notorious for sometimes firing all six chambers at once, according to Mark Twain.] And he said that if he were to die as postmaster, or as blacksmith, or as postmaster and blacksmith both, the people might stand it; but if he were to die all over, it would be a frightful loss to the community.\\" In 1866, gold was discovered in the vicinity, and a year later prospecting began on what would become the Carissa mine. Prospectors and adventurers quickly arrived and founded South Pass City. Within a year, the community's population had swelled to about 2,000. One of those who arrived in 1869 was Esther Hobart Morris. In 1870 she became the first woman in the United States to serve as a Justice of the Peace. At her urging in 1869, William H. Bright, a saloon owner and representative to the Wyoming Territorial Constitutional Convention, introduced a women's suffrage clause into the territorial constitution. When the constitution was approved by Territorial Governor John A. Campbell in December 1869, Wyoming became the first jurisdiction in the United States to grant women the right to vote, a right which was not granted women nationally until 1920. Within a decade, the city's population shrank dramatically, as the large gold deposits that had been hoped for failed to materialize. By the mid-1870s South Pass City's population was reduced to about 100 people but apparently grew to 180 by 1901. Over the next century the population of South Pass City declined even further. Many of the city's homes, mercantile stores, hotels and saloons fell into disrepair. A few businesses continued to operate in South Pass City, with the last of the pioneer families finally moving out in 1949. South Pass City State Historic Site By the end of the 20th century, steps were being taken to renew the community, and to develop it as an historic site for destination tourism. The community in the early 21st century consists of two areas: South Pass City, in which a handful of residents live, and South Pass City State Historic Site, which preserves more than 30 historic structures dating from the city's heyday in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1970, the community was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The town has been extensively documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) in drawings and in photographs, by HABS photographer Jack Boucher. Highways The road west out of South Pass City intersects with west of town; Wyo. 28 intersects with thirty-five miles north of that intersection.

Further musicians who played with the Oxcentrics included Yva Thakurdas (trumpet) and Hugh Wallis (tuba). The band's manager was Laura Lassman. The band continued in a changed form in London in the 1980s, managed by Olly Weindling, using many of the top young London jazz musicians such as Ashley Slater, Mark Lockheart and Billy Jenkins. Guests included Django Bates, Iain Ballamy and many others from Loose Tubes. In 1988, the Oxcentrics produced a CD, Oxcentromania! through Eccentric Records. In 2005, the Oxcentrics reformed to celebrate their 30th anniversary. They also got together again in 2006 for a one-off gig at a ball held at St Hugh's College, Oxford, again in 2016 for a late 40th-anniversary gig, and in 2019 back at University College, Oxford, followed by a recording session.

A southeastern offshoot of the Pindus range, it is high. Since 1966, the core area of the mountain is a national park, and much of the rest has been declared a protected area under Natura 2000. Location and description Mount Oeta is located on the boundaries of the prefectures of Phocis in the south and Phthiotis in the north. Its northern side displays a steep and inaccessible terrain as it descends to the valley of the river Spercheios, forming a series of deep gorges‚Äîmost famous of which is that of the Gorgopotamos river‚Äîa few of which boast large waterfalls, including the Kremastos waterfall, considered the highest in Central Greece. To the east, Oeta is defined by the gorge of the Asopos (ŒëœÉœâœÄœåœÇ) river, which forms its boundary with the neighbouring Mount Kallidromo. The southern slopes of Oeta are very gentle, bordering with the mountains Vardousia to the southwest and Giona to the southeast. On its western slope, Oeta is separated from Mount Goulina by the valley of the river Vistriza (ŒíŒØœÉœÑœÅŒπŒ∂Œ±), ancient Inachos (ŒäŒΩŒ±œáŒøœÇ). Oeta has a complex hydrogeology. Limestone and flysch, coupled with a complex geomorphology, combine to create a large network of sinkholes and caverns, giving rise to many springs, small rivers, and seasonal ponds in the main plateaus, chiefly those of Livadies (ŒõŒπŒ≤Œ±Œ¥ŒπŒ≠œÇ), Amaliolaka (ŒëŒºŒ±ŒªŒπœåŒªŒ±Œ∫Œ±) and Katavothra (ŒöŒ±œÑŒ±Œ≤œåŒ∏œÅŒ±). Three major rivers spring forth from the mountain: Gorgopotamos and Asopos from the east, and Vistriza/Inachos from the west, all of which are tributaries of Spercheios. The streams of the southern slope flow into the river Mornos. The mountain's tallest peak, Pyrgos (Œ†œçœÅŒ≥ŒøœÇ), has a height of , while the second-tallest is that of Greveno (ŒìœÅŒµŒ≤ŒµŒΩœå) at . A total of 22 settlements are located on Mount Oeta: * Argyrochori, Kombotades, Kostalexis, Loutra Ypatis, Mexiates, Sykas, and Ypati to the north * Gorgopotamos, Dyo Vouna, and Koumaritsi to the east * Oiti, Kastriotissa, Mavrolithari, Pavliani, and Pyra to the south * Kapnochori, Kastania, Lychno, Mesochori, Neochori, Peristeri, and Pyrgos to the west National Park In 1966, Mount Oeta became the sixth of Greece's national parks in accordance with Royal Decree 218/1966. With an area of 7,000 hectares, of which 3,370 form the core zone and 3,630 the periphery, the park covers approximately one fourth of the mountain's area and is the third largest in Greece. Any human activity that impacts the local environment in whatsoever way is forbidden within the national park's boundaries. The area of the national park has furthermore been declared a Special Area of Conservation as part of the Natura 2000 Network. The Gorgopotamos Gorge has also been declared a SAC, and together with the national park and the Asopos valley forms the broader \\"Mount Oeta National Park - Asopos Valley\\" Special Protected Area. Oeta also has two wildlife refuges, where hunting is forbidden: the Skasmeni Frantzi ‚Äì Dyo Vouna area on the northeastern slopes, and the Oiti‚ÄìPavliani area on the southeastern. The national park and protected areas are overseen by the Management Body of Mt Oiti National Park, established as an agency of the Ministry of the Environment in 2002 (Law 3044/2002). Flora Fauna  Mammals in the park are roe deer, wild boar and hare. The balkan chamois lives on the mountain and is the symbol of the national park. Big predators of the region are brown bears, wolves and wildcats. The alpine newt is one of the amphibiens living in the park and is endangered. The park also hosts a great variety of bird species. Woodpecker species are present on Oiti, such as grey‚Äìheaded woodpecker, the white‚Äìbacked woodpecker, the black woodpecker and the syrian woodpecker. Other bird species include the ortolan bunting, the horned lark, the eurasian skylark, the tawny pipit, the alpine accentor, the black redstart, the northern wheatear, the common rock thrush, the black storck and the white‚Äìwinged snowfinch. As well as a great number of rare predatory birds, for example the golden eagle, the short‚Äìtoed snake eagle and the peregrine falcon. Fish species of the parks rivers and lakes are Sperchios barbel, Macedonian chub, Sperchios spirlin, Greek trout and probably the endangered Marathon minnow. HistoryAntiquity= In Greek mythology, Oeta is chiefly celebrated as the scene of Heracles' death, and Roman authors even gave the demi-god the epithet Oetaeus. Prepared to die, he ascended Mount Oeta, where he built a funeral pyre, gave his bow and arrows to Philoctetes, and laid himself down on the pile, his head resting on his club, and his lion's skin spread over him, and commanded Philoctetes to apply the torch to the pyre. Another version of the story claims that Zeus threw a lightning bolt on the site of Heracles' death, and that from this place sprung forth the Gorgopotamos river. The remains of a 3rd-century BC Doric temple dedicated to Heracles and his funeral pyre (Œ†œÖœÅ·Ω∞ ·º©œÅŒ±Œ∫ŒªŒ≠ŒøœÖœÇ), as well as an altar and ruins of adjacent buildings, still survive at the entrance of the Katavothra plateau at a height of 1,800 m, near the village of Pavliani. The temple complex remained in use until late Roman times. In historical times, the area of Oeta belonged to southern Thessaly, forming its southernmost district, that of Oetaea (Œü·º∞œÑŒ±·øñŒ±). A city called Oeta was also said to have been founded by Amphissus, son of Apollo and Dryope, on the territory of the Malians. Further north, Hypate/Hypata (·º° ·ΩôœÄŒ¨œÑŒ∑, œÑ·Ω∞ ·ΩùœÄŒ±œÑŒ±), modern Ypati, was the chief city of the Aenianes, and a member of the Aetolian League. The women of Hypate were associated with witchcraft in Antiquity: the sorceresses Mycale and Agaonice, called the Pharmacidae, inhabited the area. Even in more recent times, the precipice of Anemotrypa near the town was said to be the haunt of the crone Lyousa Armagou. =Middle Ages= The ancient acropolis of Ypati Hypate is still mentioned in the 6th century by the historian Procopius of Caesarea, who recorded repairs to its walls by Emperor Justinian I, and in the Synecdemus. The city may have been abandoned after the Slavic invasions of the 7th century, and reappears in the 10th century under the name Neai Patrai (\\"New Patras\\") or Patrai Helladikai (\\"Patras in [the theme of] Hellas\\"). Until the 13th century, the city is mentioned only as an ecclesiastical center, being a metropolitan bishopric with one (10th century) and eventually twelve (12th century) suffragans. The city played a major role in the latter 13th century, when it was the capital of the independent Greek rulers of Thessaly, John I Doukas, Constantine Doukas and John II Doukas. The Catalan Company seized Neopatras and much of Phthiotis and southern Thessaly in 1319, forming the new Duchy of Neopatras, a vassal of the Duchy of Athens. It was one of the last remaining Catalan possessions in Greece, and fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1394. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the fortress town of Siderokastron was also located on the eastern slopes of Oeta. The Agathonos Monastery, dating at least to the 15th century, lies on the northern slopes of the mountain near Ypati. =Modern era= The area played an important role in the Greek Resistance movement against the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II. The destruction of the Gorgopotamos viaduct on 25 November 1942 by a joint effort of Greek Resistance forces and British saboteurs is ranked as one of the most spectacular sabotage actions in occupied Europe.

It lies on the Caldicot Levels beside the Severn Estuary, and is in the community of Magor with Undy. Magor lies close to the M4 motorway. There is a nearby motorway service area sharing its name and it is within the commuter belts of Newport, Bristol and Cardiff. History The original Welsh language name Magwyr, from which the English name is derived, is thought to originate from the Latin maceria, meaning masonry walls or ruins. It may relate either to a now-lost Roman villa in the area, or alternatively to sea defences or a causeway built by the Romans. Magor and the surrounding area contain many Roman ruins and artefacts, and the village centre was originally located at the inner edge of salt marshes which the Romans began to reclaim as farmland. The local name \\"Whitewall\\" may relate to the same causeway, which would have connected the village to a small now-vanished harbour on the Severn Estuary known as Abergwaitha or Aberweytha.Name \\"Magor\\" at Gwent County History Association In 1994 the remains of a 13th-century boat, used for trading along and across the Severn Estuary, and perhaps with Ireland, were found buried in the mud of the estuary close to Magor Pill. The boat was found to have been carrying iron ore from Glamorgan. Magor, as \\"Magur\\", is one of the few villages to appear on the Cambriae Typus map of 1573.A reproduction of the map is at :File:Atlas_Ortelius_KB_PPN369376781-011av-011br.jpg  St Mary's Church, Magor St. Mary's Church, Magor The remains of the Procurator's House According to tradition, the parish church was founded in the 7th century, and was originally dedicated to St. Leonard.Sir Joseph Bradney, A History of Monmouthshire, vol.4 part 2, 1932 The existing building has been described as \\"one of the most ambitious churches in Monmouthshire\\".John Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire, 2000, The earliest parts of the building date from the 13th century, at about the same time as it was handed by Gilbert Marshal, Earl of Pembroke to the Abbey of Anagni in Italy. It was later administered by Tintern Abbey. The church was greatly extended in the 15th century, and was restored and re-dedicated to St. Mary in the mid-19th century. Remains of The Procurator's House, some parts of which may date from the 14th century and others from the 16th century, are still standing just off the village square. The procurator was responsible for collecting the tithes of the village on behalf of the abbey. The church is the burial place of Welsh composer Mansel Thomas. Amenities Although it could be described as a dormitory town, it has a thriving village centre containing shops, pubs, restaurants and a Post Office. As well as the large parish church, the village also has an historic Baptist church.Ebenezer Baptist Church Magor and the neighbouring village of Undy support a thriving athletic club whose clubhouse and pitches are found at the eastern end of the villages. Undy actually consists of all land lying to the north of Magor reen, taking in Dancing Hill where the reen intersects Cowleaze (Magor) to the south and Millfield Park and Mill Reen (Undy) to the north. Vinegar Hill, often regarded as a boundary point between Magor and Undy, actually lies wholly within Undy. Magor Marsh is a wetland reserve managed by the Gwent Wildlife Trust. It has a rich variety of habitats, including damp hay meadows, sedge fen, reedbed, scrub, wet woodland, a large pond and numerous reens.

The station provided three sidings serving local farmers. By the 1920s, traffic on the line was so heavy that refuge sidings were provided on both lines. In 1941 the main line was doubled to four running lines, with the outer two lines as slow goods-only lines to serve the increasing wartime coal traffic, without delaying fast trains on the central main lines. The station closed, along with Undy Halt, in November 1964; although the goods yard remained open until 1965 for cement trains connected with the building of the M4 motorway.

Career  Louisville and Nashville Railway = On January 1, 1888, Knott was promoted to traffic manager for Louisville and Nashville Railway (L&N;), a position he held until October 7, 1891. He was then promoted to first vice president. Knott was a key representative in defending the L&N;'s haulage and drayage rates through the 1890s. In 1895, the L&N; was brought to court over its rates for hauling coal in Kentucky. Knott was one of the L&N; representatives present for the railroad's defense. Similarly, drayage rates in New Orleans were also disputed at a meeting where Knott represented the L&N.; Also in 1895, several grocers' associations began a boycott of the L&N; due to its freight rates for their members, to which Knott again defended the L&N;'s practices in refusing to offer a differential rate between carload and less-than-carload shipments. With all of the rate disputes, rumors began to circulate that the Southern States Passenger Association, which related to passenger train operations in the region, including those of the L&N;, may dissolve. = Plant System = In October 1899, Knott was elected as vice president of the Plant System, under R. G. Erwin as president. But his time with the Plant System lasted less than a year as he resigned in July 1900 to take the vice president and general manager position at Chicago and Alton Railroad. Knott was succeeded as vice president of the Plant System by Morton F. Plant, the son of Henry B. Plant who had founded the Plant System. = Kansas City Southern Railway = Concurrent with his appointment at the Alton, Knott was selected to succeed Samuel W. Fordyce as president of Kansas City Southern Railway on July 11, 1900, beginning his term on August 1. At this time, Knott was also appointed as traffic manager for Union Pacific Railroad, further connecting these three Harriman-controlled railroad companies. Rumors began to circulate that Knott would soon be named president of the C&A.; Following an inspection trip over the entire KCS system in the first week of August 1900, Knott affirmed to reporters that the KCS will remain an independently operated railroad. Soon after taking office at KCS, Knott sought to expand the railroad. He and Edward F. Swinney, then president of First National Bank of Kansas City, were appointed as receivers for the Kansas City Suburban Belt Railway, Union Terminal Railway and the Kansas City and Independence Air Line so that they could be more easily integrated and merged into the KCS system. In late October 1900, reports circulated that John W. Gates took control of a majority of shares of KCS stock, which led to rumors that W. G. Brimson would succeed Knott as president. It was soon revealed that Gates hadn't gained full control, rather that Harriman had purchased KCS stock from Gates and Knott would continue as president. A few days later, on November 3, 1900, a new board of directors for the KCS was announced, which included Harriman, Gates, Knott and former president Fordyce as well as George J. and Edwin Gould; the new board confirmed Knott's continuing term as president. On January 3, 1901, Knott served as chairman for a conference in New York City discussing standard freight rates for western and northwestern railroads. The conference closed with no significant changes to the rates and no new resolutions adopted, with Knott reported as \\"being entirely satisfied with the present situation.\\" In June 1901, rumors were published that Knott was to succeed Samuel Felton as president of the Alton. Felton denied the rumors. At the 1902 annual meeting of the Kansas City, Shreveport and Gulf Railway and the Kansas City, Shreveport and Gulf Terminal Company, Knott was elected president of both companies, the latter company being the owner of Shreveport Union Station. A year after the previous rumors of his resignation, new rumors emerged in July 1902, some citing J.P. Morgan Company, that Knott would leave the KCS to return to the L&N; as president. As with the previous rumors, Knott denied these claims as well.

Roqu√© started appearing with the main squad in 2010‚Äì11, making his debut on 9 October after replacing Rov√©rsio late into the first half of a 2‚Äì2 draw at UD Las Palmas. He totalled 12 games (ten starts) and two goals, as the Andalusians returned to La Liga after a two-year absence. Health and death On 5 March 2011, after undergoing a routine check-up due to back problems, Roqu√© was diagnosed with pelvic cancer, undergoing surgery to excise a malignant tumor the following day. Betis' fan clubs raised funds for his treatment, while Carles Puyol, of the same province, financed ‚Ç¨30,000 for specialist private treatment. On 24 June 2012, after just over a year of illness, Roqu√© lost his battle against cancer and died, two weeks before his 24th birthday. His death prompted a series of tributes on Twitter, including from several international players competing in UEFA Euro 2012, and on 1 July, after the final of the continental competition, Spain goalkeeper Pepe Reina (his former Liverpool teammate) wore a Betis shirt featuring Roqu√©'s name during the players' victory lap of the Olympic Stadium in Kiev; also, Cesc F√†bregas wore a shirt with the names of Roqu√©, Dani Jarque, Manolo Preciado and Antonio Puerta. To the Betis fans, Roqu√© became known as \\"The Eternal 26\\", in reference to his kit number during his spell at the club, and the fans chanted his name in the 26th minute of each half of a match. In 2013, a monolith dedicated to him was unveiled in his hometown, with a plaque endowed with the crests of the clubs that he represented. During his illness, Roqu√© worked with writer Juan Manuel L√≥pez: to have a book on himself published was one of his two wishes, the other being to return to football. La Luz de Miki Roqu√© (The Light of Miki Roqu√©) was released in March 2015, featuring contributions from his family and Betis staff.

She was also the widow of the distinguished novelist Graham Greene.Norman Sherry, \\"Obituary: Vivien Greene\\", The Guardian, 23 August 2003 Early life Vivien Dayrell-Browning was born in Rhodesia. As a child she spent her pocket-money collecting dolls' house furniture. She had a difficult childhood: her father had an affair and her mother left him, requiring Vivien at the age of fifteen to write him a letter ending their relationship.Norman Sherry, The Life of Graham Greene: Vol. 1, 1904‚Äì1939. London: Jonathan Cape, 1989, p. 475. She published her first book The Little Wings, a collection of poetry and prose, when she was thirteen; it had an introduction by G. K. Chesterton, who was a family friend. Jessica Amanda Salmonson, \\"Girl Writers: Nathalia Crane, Vivienne Dayrell & Daisy Ashford\\" She began working for Basil Blackwell when she was fifteen. Marriage, family and separation  Vivien Dayrell-Browning started a correspondence with Graham Greene in 1925. A staunch convert to Roman Catholicism, she rejected his initial proposal of marriage because he was an atheist. Following his conversion, they married on 15 October 1927 at St Mary's Church, Hampstead, North London. The Greenes had two children, Lucy Caroline (born 1933) and Francis Hugh (born 1936). Graham left his family in 1947 and they formally separated in 1948, but in accordance with Roman Catholic teaching the couple were never divorced and the marriage lasted until Graham's death in 1991.  Doll's House Collecting  During World War II, Vivien and her children lived in Oxford after their home in London had been bombed. At a local auction she was charmed by a derelict Regency town house which she bought for ¬£5 and took home on the bus with her. As the war dragged on and her marriage disintegrated, she devoted herself to restoring and furnishing the doll's house. Materials were scarce; she recalled scraping off old paint and wallpaper with shards of broken glass. \\"I needed a hobby, the wartime evenings in the black-out were long and dark, so I started to furnish the house, to make carpets and curtains for it.\\"Charlotte Cory, \\"Escape from the doll's house\\", The Independent, 29 November 1998. She then began seeking out other antique dolls' houses and furnishings with her friend the historian A. J. P. Taylor researching their history, and restoring the houses, filling the Greenes' rented home with her miniature world. After Graham had abandoned his family, she travelled the world to add to her collection, becoming a noted authority in the field of antique dolls' houses between 1700 and 1900 and their social history and craftsmanship. The earliest item in her collection was a William-and-Mary house built in oak in about 1690 in the shape of a cabinet, suitable to be displayed in a drawing room.Elliott, Ruth 'History in Miniature' p22-23 Dolls houses were initially created as a status symbol, built as a replica of the owner's home or as an ornament on a staircase landing. Only after the 1840s were they intended for children. After her children left home, Greene began a personal mission to view, draw and catalogue any historic doll's houses she could discover before the doll's houses, and the great English country houses in which they were found, disappeared in the postwar world. As many as possible she restored to their original grandeur, paying great attention to historical authenticity. Viviene Green's first book English Dolls' Houses of the 18th and 19th Centuries (1955) is credited with convincing dealers and museum curators that doll's houses were a serious field of study and required conservation. Her notes record 1,500 dolls' houses that she examined in North America, Europe and South Africa. In 1962 she even made the journey through Checkpoint Charlie to Communist East Germany to research the original plans of 19th century makers of miniature furniture based at Schloss Tenneberg, near Walterhausen Thuringia. In 1962 she built the Rotunda as a doll's house museum in the grounds of her home near Oxford, incorporating the spiral staircase from the St James's Theatre. The museum was partially funded by Graham Greene and opened by Sir Albert Richardson, who later donated a dolls' house. By the mid-1990s, the Rotunda contained over 50 miniature castles, cottages and manors, all furnished down to the last tiny piece of porcelain, dating from c.1700 to 1886. The focus was specifically on the craftsmanship, and only children over sixteen years were allowed to visit on the monthly opening to the public. Her collection was auctioned off in London in 1998. A cat lover, she was also a supporter of the Protection of Tigers League.

The name Cibola is thought to be the original Zuni Indian name for their pueblos or tribal lands. The name was later interpreted by the Spanish to mean, \\"buffalo.\\" The forest is disjointed with lands spread across central and northern New Mexico, west Texas and Oklahoma. The Cibola National Forest is divided into four Ranger Districts: the Sandia, Mountainair, Mt. Taylor, and Magdalena. The Forest includes the San Mateo, Magdalena, Datil, Bear, Gallina, Manzano, Sandia, Mt. Taylor, and Zuni Mountains of west-central New Mexico. The Forest also manages four National Grasslands that stretch from northeastern New Mexico eastward into the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma. The Cibola National Forest and Grassland is administered by Region 3 of the United States Forest Service from offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Elevation ranges from 5,000 ft (1,500 m) to 11,301 ft (3,445 m). (The preceding figures do not include any of the four National Grasslands mentioned below, which are detailed in their individual articles.) The descending order of Cibola National Forest acres (not counting the three Grassland areas) by county are: Socorro, Cibola, McKinley, Catron, Torrance, Bernalillo, Sandoval County, New Mexico, Lincoln, Sierra, and Valencia counties in New Mexico. The Cibola National Forest currently has 137,701 acres designated as Wilderness. In addition to these acres, it has 246,000 acres classified as Inventoried Roadless Areas pursuant to the Roadless Area Conservation Rule. The Cibola National Forest is organized into several divisions over three states. The Rita Blanca National Grassland in Dallam County, Texas and Cimarron County, Oklahoma, Black Kettle National Grassland in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma and Hemphill County, Texas, and McClellan Creek National Grassland in Gray County, Texas are in the Oklahoma-Texas panhandle region. The combined Cibola National Grasslands are 262,141 acres (1,060.8 km2) in size. New Mexico is home to much of the Forest, including the Kiowa National Grassland in Harding, Union, Mora, and Colfax counties, New Mexico. The Cibola National Forest's Sandia Ranger District is just east of Albuquerque in Central New Mexico and includes the most visited mountains in the state of New Mexico. The Sandia District includes national forest land in eastern Bernalillo and southeastern Sandoval counties, and includes the Sandia Peak Tram and the Sandia Crest National Scenic Byway. The Sandia Mountains lie in the northern portion of the District. It is here where Congress designated the Sandia Mountain Wilderness (37,200 acres) in 1978. The Cibola's Sandia Ranger District also includes the Manzanita Mountains, which stretch south, between the Sandia and the Manzano Mountains. The Manzano Mountains are managed by the Cibola National Forest's Mountainair Ranger District. View from Sandia Peak, in the Sandia Mountains. In the background is Albuquerque, New Mexico. In the center is a tramway car moving along the Sandia Peak Tramway. The Mountainair Ranger District manages national forestland in Torrance, northwestern Lincoln, and eastern Valencia counties, which are in central New Mexico. Within the Mountainair District are the Gallinas Mountains and the Manzano Mountains. Congress designated the Manzano Wilderness in 1978. The Mount Taylor Ranger District manages land in northern Cibola, southern McKinley, and western Sandoval counties in western New Mexico. Mount Taylor and Zuni Mountains are within the Mount Taylor District. Overseeing approximately 800,000 acres, the Magdalena Ranger District is the largest of the Cibola National Forest's four mountain districts. The Cibola‚Äôs Magdalena District manages land in south central New Mexico in western Socorro, northeastern Catron, and northern Sierra counties. The Bear Mountains, Datil Mountains, Magdalena Mountains and San Mateo Mountains are all within the Magdalena District. There are two Wilderness areas in this District - the Apache Kid (44,626 acres) and the Withington (19,000 acres) Wilderness areas, both of which are in the San Mateo Mountains. In addition to the designated Wilderness, the Magdalena Ranger District has 205,972 acres of Inventoried Roadless Areas. The Magdalena Ranger District's officers are stationed in the Village of Magdalena. The District has roots in the Gila Forest Reserve, created by President William McKinley in 1899, making the U.S. Forest Service the ‚Äúoldest continuous business in Magdalena.‚Äù Ecology Cibola biomes range from Chihuahuan desert to short grass prairie to pi√±on-juniper to sub-alpine spruce and fir. The region also boasts wildlife as diverse as the biomes they inhabit. Animals represented include: *black bear *cougar *prairie dog *mule deer *pronghorn *black rosy finch *goshawk *Mexican spotted owl *wild turkey Due to the Rio Grande, a large variety of migrating waterfowl and other birds follow the river's flyway during the spring and fall. Birds of prey are also present using the updrafts and thermals along the north-south alignment of the central mountains for their migration.

The ‚Äòsky islands‚Äô region of the Cibola hosts more than 200 rare plant and animal species, with more than 30 species listed as endangered or threatened by New Mexico or the federal government. The region is home to more bird and mammal species than any other ecoregion in the Southwest. The Rio Grande Watershed, which contains the Cibola‚Äôs four mountain ranger districts, ranked second out of eight watershed regions for species of greatest conservation need (SGCN) in the New Mexico Game and Fish‚Äôs Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy. The Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy also ranked the Arizona-New Mexico Mountain Ecoregion, within which the Magdalena and Mt. Taylor Ranger Districts are located, second out of six ecoregions in the state for SGCN, with 80 identified SGCN. The Nature Conservancy has identified the San Mateo, Magdalena, and Datil Mountains within the Cibola's Magdalena Ranger District as key conservation areas due to their ecological diversity. Recreation and special uses The Cibola offers an abundance of recreational opportunities including picnicking, backpacking, camping, skiing, hiking, wildlife-viewing, star-gazing, horseback-riding, hunting and mountain biking as well as driving for pleasure and enjoying the aerial Sandia Peak Tramway with a restaurant and skiing at the top. The two most popular recreational activities on the Cibola are hiking/walking and viewing natural features with 35% and 15% of visitors citing these as their main activities, respectively. Resting and enjoying the view from the top of the Cienega Trail in the Sandia Mountains In addition to ample recreational opportunities, the Cibola provides special facilities for scientific research. The largest special use permit on the Cibola is for the Langmuir Research Site, with 31,000-acres on South Baldy Peak. The Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric Research was established to study atmospheric processes that result in lightning, hail, and rain. The Magdalena Ridge Observatory (MRO), also located on South Baldy, studies astronomical events with a 2.4-m telescope and the Magdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer. Both Langmuir and MRO are operated by the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. Additional multiple uses that occur on the Cibola National Forest include grazing, mining, logging, and oil/gas development. History The lands in the Cibola National Forest have a rich cultural history. The forest itself grew out of lands first established as Forest Reserves in the late 1800s to protect natural resources, such as watersheds, trees, and soils. The human and cultural history of these national forest lands stretch back well before the 1800s. Basham noted in his report documenting the archeological history of the Cibola‚Äôs Magdalena Ranger District that ‚Äú[t]he heritage resources on the district are diverse and representative of nearly every prominent human evolutionary event known to anthropology. Evidence for human use of district lands date back 14,000 years to the Paleoindian period providing glimpses into the peopling of the New World and megafaunal extinction.‚Äú File:1908-ZuniMountains.JPGThe Zuni Mountains of the Cibola National Forest in the winter of 1908.

Much of the now Magdalena Ranger District were a province of the Apache. Bands of Apache effectively controlled the Magdalena-Datil region from the seventeenth century until they were defeated in the Apache Wars in the late nineteenth century. Outlaw renegades Butch Cassidy and the Wild Bunch and notorious Apaches like Cochise and Geronimo have ties to the San Mateos. Vicks Peak was named after Victorio, ‚Äúa Mimbre√±o Apache leader whose territory included much of the south and southwest New Mexico.‚Äù Famous for defying relocation orders in 1879 and leading his warriors ‚Äúon a two-year reign of terror before he was killed,‚Äù Victorio is at least as highly regarded as Geronimo or Cochise among Apaches. Perhaps the most famous outlaw was the Apache Kid whose supposed grave lies within the Apache Kid Wilderness. Stories of depredations by the Apache Kid, and of his demise, became so common and dramatic that in southwestern folklore they may be exceeded only by tales of lost Spanish gold. Native Americans lingered in the San Mateos well into the 1900s. We know this by an essay written by Aldo Leopold in 1919 where he documents stumbling upon the remains of a recently abandoned Indian hunting camp. File:The Apache Kid.jpgThe Apache Kid is the namesake for a Wilderness area in the Cibola National Forest.

A mining rush followed the Apache wars ‚Äì gold, silver, and copper were found in the mountains. It wasn‚Äôt until this time that extensive use of the area by non-Native Americans occurred. While some mining activity, involving gold, silver, and copper, occurred in the southern part of the range near the end of the nineteenth century,Butterfield, Mike, and Greene, Peter, Mike Butterfield's Guide to the Mountains of New Mexico, New Mexico Magazine Press, 2006, the prospecting/mining remnants are barely visible today due to collapse, topographic screening, and vegetation regrowth. While miners combed the mountains for mineral riches during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, stockmen drove tens of thousands of sheep and cattle to stockyards at the village of Magdalena, then linked by rail with Socorro. In fact, the last regularly used cattle trail in the United States stretched 125 miles westward from Magdalena. The route was formally known as the Magdalena Livestock Driveway, but more popularly known to cowboys and cattlemen as the Beefsteak Trail. The trail began use in 1865 and its peak was in 1919. The trail was used continually until trailing gave way to trucking and the trail official closed in 1971. Fires In 2008 the Trigo Fire burned mostly within the Mountainair Ranger District of the Cibola National Forest.

Early life Levine was born in Toledo, Ohio, and grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York. To help his family, he worked on an ice truck at age 8, and was assigned to truant schools until he lied about his age and joined the US Navy at 15. He said he was in fights on board constantly because of his red hair and his Jewish heritage. He subsequently jumped ship in the Republic of Panama and ventured back to New York City. Mob career Levine was a member of the notorious Mafia gang, Murder, Inc., and is credited with being the trigger man, with Dutch Schultz lieutenant Abraham \\"Bo\\" Weinberg, in the 1931 murders of Joe \\"The Boss\\" Masseria and, along with Joe Adonis, Albert \\"Mad Hatter\\" Anastasia and Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel, one of the three hitmen sent by Meyer Lansky to assassinate the Sicilian Mafia boss Salvatore Maranzano in his office. They managed to enter by posing as government agents. Once inside Maranzano's office on the 9th floor of The Helmsley Building, they disarmed the guards and shot and stabbed Maranzano to death. Levine had a longstanding rivalry with fellow Murder, Inc. hitman, Charles \\"The Bug\\" Workman. He was irritated that the greedy Workman took most of the murder contracts that would have otherwise been handed over to him. In his court testimony, Abe Reles recalled that Levine once complained to him that \\"any time I've got a contract Charlie is around to do the killing.\\" A portrait of the seldom-photographed Levine appears in the book New York City Gangland, depicting him during his career as a Murder, Inc. assassin. There is no mention of him when most of the Murder, Inc. and their surrounding factions were rounded up and successfully prosecuted by the end of 1940. He simply faded into the background and was not heard from again until some undetermined point in time. A short piece in The New York Times from December 22, 2009, yielded a few clues to the post 1940 whereabouts of Levine. According to Sanford L. Smith, son of Izzy Smith who owned the Zion Memorial Chapel on Canal and Ludlow streets in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, they had Levine on the payroll as late as 1965 or 1966. \\"Red [Levine] was one of the few guys from Murder Inc. who never got killed or went to prison. He was on our payroll. He needed to show legitimate income. Red got a check of $200 every week,\\" Smith told The New York Times. A bit more of the timeline of Levine's life surfaces in an article from The Village Voice dated March 6, 2001, which briefly discusses Levine's activity with the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union (NMDU) and suggests that Levine's participation in the union took place in the 1970s when he was more than 70 years old: \\"Formed in the early 1900s, the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union was equal parts Irish, Italian, and Jewish, a reflection of the city's then dominant ethnic groups. Well into the 1970s, Jewish racketeers played a major role in the union. One of them, Red Levine, was reputed to have been one of the assassins of Salvatore Maranzano, the old-school mobster who helped to found America's Cosa Nostra. Law enforcement officials, as well as longtime union members and mob associates (often the same thing in the NMDU) say that Levine cleverly allowed each of the city's five Mafia families to have a piece of the newspaper delivery action, which included bootleg sales of stolen papers as well as loan-sharking and gambling among drivers.\\" In his later years, Levine reportedly spent time in the Little Italy district, frequenting the Knotty Pine Social Club, a known Mafia hangout operated by Genovese capo Peter DeFeo, as well as the Raven Knights Social club, more commonly known in later years as the \\"Ravenite\\". He had one son who was arrested as a young adult for mob related crimes. In popular culture Levine was portrayed by Paul Bruce in the original 1959 television series \\"The Untouchables\\". Levine is the great-uncle by marriage of the American artist Sam Gould, of the arts collaborative Red 76. The group's project Levine's Market and Meeting House is a loose homage to Levine.

It was built for the Church of England, but it is now a Greek Orthodox church known as the Greek Orthodox Cathedral Church of All Saints. It stands where Camden Street and Pratt Street meet. History Camden Town was developed from the 1790s onwards in the then largely rural parish of St Pancras, on the northern fringe of London. The parish church was one of the oldest in England, but it had been in gradual decline since the 14th century when the weight of the parish population became the northern parts such as what was becoming called Kentish Town and Camden Town. In 1822 a new parish church, St Pancras New Church, on Euston Road in the southern part of the parish, was consecrated, but it was intended mainly to serve the population in its immediate vicinity. In 1818 a Church Building Act had been passed by Parliament to facilitate the construction of new churches in London's many new districts, including this one for Camden Town. All Saints, Camden Town, in 1828. The church was built between 1822 and 1824 and was known as first as the Camden Chapel, then, unofficially, as St Stephen's. It did not receive the dedication of All Saints until 1920. It was designed by the father and son team of William and Henry Inwood who were also responsible for St Pancras New Church. It is a fairly large building of yellow stock brick, with east and west ends faced in Portland stone. The plan is basically rectangular, with an eastern apse mirrored by a semi-circular portico at the west end. Just behind the portico is a cylindrical stone tower surrounded by columns, in imitation of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens. The Ionic order is based on fragments brought back from Greece by Henry Inwood and now in the British Museum. The interior has a flat ceiling, with galleries on three sides supported by Ionic columns. The building has generally been praised, but both contemporary writers and later architectural critics such as Sir John Summerson have argued that the tower is too thin in proportion to the body of the church. It is a Grade I listed building. All Saints Greek Orthodox Cathedral It became a parish church in its own right in 1852. In the 19th century it had a large congregation, like many other Anglican churches in the Victorian era: an 1854 survey of church attendance found that the number of worshippers was 1,650 on Sunday mornings, 630 on Sunday afternoons and 1,430 on Sunday evenings. In the 20th century the congregation decreased and in 1948 All Saints became a Greek Orthodox church, retaining its dedication while St Michael's in Camden Road took over the parish, becoming the main Anglican church in Camden Town. The area acquired a large Greek speaking community in the decades after World War II, mostly from Cyprus, and the church is still well used, though many of the worshippers now come from the outer suburbs of London. In 1991 All Saints was raised to the status of a cathedral. The church has been renovated a number of times. Most recently since January 2009 under the supervision of English Heritage and co-sponsored by the National Lottery and donations from the Greek Orthodox Community of the parish.

(1878-1948) Son of Samuel W. Fordyce Samuel Wesley \\"Colonel\\" Fordyce (February 7, 1840 - August 3, 1919) was a prominent railroad executive of the American South. He served on several boards of directors and as president of a few railroads. Fordyce was also the receiver for several railroads when they declared bankruptcy.  Early life  Fordyce was born in Guernsey County, Ohio, to John Fordyce and Mary Ann Houseman, both of whom were from Pennsylvania. Samuel was one of ten children. He attended Madison College in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, and later studied at North Illinois University in Henry County, Illinois.  Military career  At the age of twenty, after completing his studies, Fordyce returned home to work as a station agent on the Central Ohio Railroad. After a year, he enlisted as a private in the First Ohio Volunteer Cavalry to fight in the Civil War. He was soon promoted to second lieutenant and then to a first lieutenancy of Company B, First Ohio Volunteers. In 1863, he was promoted to captain of Company H and soon after was made assistant inspector general of cavalry in the Army of the Cumberland. Fordyce was wounded three times and captured three times, but he was recaptured two of those times and managed to escape the other.  Professional career  After the Civil War, Fordyce relocated to Huntsville, Alabama, and established a banking house, Fordyce & Rison. Fordyce assisted in financing the North & South Alabama Railway from Decatur to Montgomery. In January 1876, Fordyce moved near Hot Springs, Arkansas, after being in bad health and knowing the reputation of Hot Springs as a health resort. While in Hot Springs, Fordyce contributed greatly to the development of the city. He assisted Senator John A. Logan in introducing a bill to build an Army and Navy Hospital on government reservation land in Hot Springs. Fordyce also helped to finance hotels, an opera house, water, gas and electric light works, street railcars, and other public enterprises. Fordyce soon turned his attention to building a network of railroads in the south and southwest. The St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company was built under Fordyce's management, which he operated for sixteen years. Fordyce served in many positions in the rail industry. For three years, he was vice president and treasurer of the Texas & St. Louis Railway. He was a receiver from 1885 to 1886 and president of the railroad, which was reorganized under the name St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway, from 1886 to 1889. He served as receiver from 1889 to 1890 and president from 1890 to 1898 of the newly titled St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company. In 1899, Fordyce was appointed receiver of the Kansas City, Pittsburgh & Gulf Railway and became its president a year later, when it was renamed the Kansas City Southern Railway. In 1900 and 1901, he helped built the Little Rock, Hot Springs & Western Railway. It is estimated that Fordyce has contributed to the building and financing of at least ten thousand miles of railway. His contributions to the railroad include the following lines: St. Louis-San Francisco system; Missouri, Oklahoma & Gulf Railroad; the Illinois, Indiana & Minnesota Railroad; the Apalachicola Northern in Florida; the St. Louis; Guthrie & El Reno Railroad in Oklahoma; the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway in Texas; and the Fort Worth and Denver Railway. Aside from his work in the transportation industry, Fordyce held a number of other prominent positions including director and organizer of the St. Louis Union Trust Company, director of the Laclede Light & Power Company, director of the Jefferson Hotel Company, vice president of the Arlington and New York Hotel Companies, president of the Hot Springs Water, Gas, and Electric Light Companies, president of the Hot Springs Electric Street Railway Company, director of the Illinois, Indiana & Minnesota Railroad, director of the Apalachicola & Northern, director of the Kansas City Southern, director of the Little Rock & Hot Springs Western, chairman of the executive committee of the St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico, and director in the American Rio Grande Land & Irrigation Company of Texas, the largest irrigating canal system in the United States. Fordyce was also elected, by unanimous vote of all lines in the Southwestern Traffic Association, as chairman of its executive board. The association represented almost all traffic from the Atlantic west to the Mississippi, to California, and to old Mexico.  Political career  Fordyce was an active democrat, serving as delegate to conventions in Alabama during reconstruction, after the Civil War. He was a member of the state committee in 1874 when an entirely democratic ticket was elected. In 1880, Fordyce was a delegate to the state gubernatorial convention in Arkansas. He was also a delegate to the state judicial convention in 1884, member of the democratic national committee of Arkansas from 1884 to 1888, delegate to the national democratic convention of 1884, member of the committee to notify Cleveland and Hendricks of their nomination as president and vice president, delegate at large to the national democratic convention of 1892, and chairman of the committee on permanent organization. Fordyce was often asked to run for governor or senator, but declined. Fordyce's was respected by both parties for his political knowledge and several presidents sought his advice, including President Hayes, President Harrison, and President McKinley. Letter,from S. W. Fordyce, St. Louis to David Rowland Francis, February 13, 1891; David Rowland Francis, 1889-1893; Office of Governor, Record Group 3.27; Missouri State Archives, Jefferson City. It is clear that Fordyce had some political influence, as he wrote to Missouri Governor David Rowland Francis in 1891 recommending John C. Kelton, an employee of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company for a position in the County Surveyors Office.  Personal life  Fordyce married Susan E. Chadick on May 1, 1866. Susan was the daughter of Reverend William D. Chadick, of Hunstville, Alabama. Susan and Samuel had two daughters and three sons. Their son, John Rison Fordyce (1869-1939) was an engineer, inventor, amateur historian, and archaeologist, and a candidate for United States Congress. He also made an expedition to the Arctic as part of Dr. Frederick A. Cook's team in 1894. In 1917, John was commissioned Major of Engineers and oversaw the construction of Camp Pike.  Death and legacy  Fordyce died on August 3, 1919, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. His remains were interred at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis. The town of Fordyce, Arkansas, was named for Samuel W. Fordyce.Samuel Wesley Fordyce in The Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture There was a town in south Texas called Sam Fordyce, in the 20th century.Handbook of Texas Online, Robert E.

It also serves as an alternate airport for the cities of Armenia, Cartago, Manizales, Medell√≠n, Cali and Bogot√°. The airport lies along the edge of a deep ravine, west of Pereira. There are steep dropoffs on the sides and ends of the runway. There is high terrain in all quadrants except south. The Pereira VOR-DME (Ident: PEI) is located off the approach threshold of Runway 08. The Matecana non-directional beacon (Ident: MAT) is located off the Runway 08 threshold.Pereira VORMatecana NDB  Information  The airport was built between 1944 and 1947. Its first official flight was a C-47 piloted by captain Luis Carlos Londo√±o Iragorrion on 24 July 1947. The city of Pereira owns and manages the terminal building, while the operations are in charge of Aerocivil, being the only airport in Colombia under these conditions. It handles 75 percent of passengers in the coffee region, with an average of 30 daily commercial operations to different destinations. The passenger terminal is a four-level building built in the early 1970s. The first level includes parking positions for the airplanes, and a baggage claim area. The second/main floor has the check-in counters, airline offices, and domestic and international arrival doors. The third floor has the general waiting room, toilets, stores, restaurants and caf√©s, free Internet Wi-Fi, a devices charging station, and a VIP lounge operated by Avianca. Also on this level is security access for the two domestic waiting rooms. The international waiting room is here, with an independent door to the duty-free and security areas. In 1991 two jetways were installed from the domestic waiting rooms. On the fourth level are the airport general offices, a chapel, and two footbridges connecting the terminal with the car parking area, which is in front of the main building. A new cargo terminal was built to replace the original built in 1978. The new control tower is Colombia's second-most-advanced, behind the tower in El Dorado Airport of Bogot√°, also recently built. The terminal has easy access to public transportation, including taxi area, general bus service and an exclusive stop for the bus rapid transit system, Megabus. Currently, the airport is under a full renovation process, improving aviation safety, comfort and security for users. A 21,000m¬≤ (68,897 ft¬≤) completely new terminal is planned. The runway was extended to 2,205 meters in 2014, to allow for full certification as an international airport. In December 2016, the CSS Construction Company won the contract to demolish the current terminal and build the new terminal building. This is a public-private alliance in which the CSS company will operate the airport for 20 years while still returning some revenue to the city government. The construction began in November 2017. CSS Construction also has a 30 percent stake in the renovation at El Dorado International Airport in Bogota.  Airlines and destinations  Mateca√±a International Airport has flights to ten domestic and international destinations, and offers connections to different cities in the Americas and Europe through El Dorado International Airport in Bogot√°, Miami International Airport in the United States and Tocumen International Airport in Panama City.

Fitzgerald (January 28, 1938 ‚Äì August 7, 1967) was a United States Navy officer who was killed in action during the Vietnam War, while serving as an advisor to the Republic of Vietnam Navy. He received the Navy Cross posthumously for his role in fighting off a Viet Cong attack. Early life and Navy enlisted service Fitzgerald was born in Montpelier, Vermont, the second child and first son of Louis and Mildred Mary Fitzgerald. His father was a career Navy man who retired as a Chief Petty Officer. Fitzgerald grew up in the local area and graduated from Montpelier High School in June 1956. Following graduation, he followed in his father's footsteps and enlisted in the United States Navy. As an enlisted sailor, Fitzgerald served on , , and . Fitzgerald also served with Utility Squadron Six (VC-6) at NAS Norfolk, Virginia, while working on the Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter (DASH) program. U.S. Naval Academy studies Seaman Fitzgerald eventually earned selection for officer training by appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland with the Class of 1963. Fitzgerald excelled in naval education, softball, football, fencing, basketball, and tennis. Service as a commissioned officer Midshipman Fitzgerald graduated and was commissioned in the United States Navy on June 5, 1963. He then reported to the destroyer , where he rose from \\"boot ensign\\" to weapons department head. =Vietnam service= Following Roan, Lieutenant Fitzgerald reported to Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, California, where he attended counterinsurgency training. Upon completion he was assigned duties as the senior U.S. advisor at Coastal Defense Group Sixteen in Vietnam. This group's compound was located adjacent to the village of Co Luy, near the delta of the Tra Khuc River, and about 70 miles southeast of Da Nang. In this position, he advised the Republic of Vietnam Navy on defense measures and on the capture of military supplies and contraband destined for Viet Cong forces. At about 0300 on August 7, 1967, Coastal Defense Group Sixteen's compound came under heavy attack by two Viet Cong battalions. The assault began with an intense mortar barrage followed immediately by the advance of troops. Fitzgerald, the senior American commander, immediately ordered a retreat of the civilians within the compound. Because of the compound's location adjacent to a river and the aggressors' position, the only escape route was via water in small boats. Lieutenant Fitzgerald and three others delayed their retreat as long as possible in order to provide covering fire and to direct fire from surrounding friendly forces. Many calls were made to orbiting gunship aircraft, artillery units, and Fast Patrol Craft to provide defensive fire. The Viet Cong attack, however, was swift and well coordinated. It soon became apparent that the South Vietnamese forces were decimated and that the American bunker was the sole remaining source of resistance. As the situation deteriorated, Fitzgerald ordered his last three remaining defenders to retreat while he used arms fire to cover their escape. Fitzgerald was mortally wounded in this action. Awards and legacy In honor of Fitzgerald's service, he was posthumously awarded the U. S. Navy's second-highest decoration for valor, the Navy Cross. Additionally, he was awarded the Purple Heart, Combat Action Ribbon, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign. Fitzgerald was survived by his wife Betty Ann, and their children who continued to reside in and around Montpelier, Vermont.

It has been governed by the World Blind Cricket Council (WBCC) since 1996. So far, five Blind World Cups have been held: New Delhi, India (1998); Chennai, India (2002); Islamabad, Pakistan (2006), and India (2018). In 2012, the first Blind World Cup T20 was held in Bangalore, India. Blind cricket relies on common use of the 'sweep shot', in order to provide maximum chance of the bat hitting the ball. History Blind cricket was invented in Melbourne in 1922 by two blind factory workers who improvised the game using a tin can containing rocks. The Victorian Blind Cricket Association was founded shortly after, in 1922, and the first sports ground and clubhouse for blind cricket was built at Kooyong, Melbourne in 1928. World‚Äôs first Test Cricket match for the Blind was played between Pakistan and South Africa in which Pakistan defeated South Africa by 94 runs in the year of 2000. South Africa won first BCWC in 1998 defeating Pakistan in the finals, while Pakistan consecutively won next two BCWC defeating South Africa and India in the finals in 2002 and 2006. In 2014 championship was won by India defeating the two-time winner Pakistan. Rules The rules of blind cricket are based on the standard laws of cricket with some essential modifications. WBCC international playing rules are codified in 25 clauses, first ratified in 2005.A copy of the 2007 second revision can be downloaded here: . There are a total number of 11 players in each team: at least four players who are totally blind (classified as B1) and three partially blind players (B2), and up to four partially sighted players (B3). In terms of playing equipment, the major adaptation is the ball, which is significantly larger than a standard cricket ball and filled with ball bearings to provide audible cues. The size allows partially sighted players to see the ball and the contents allow blind players to hear it. The wicket (stumps) is also larger, made of metal tubes painted in fluorescent colours, to allow partially sighted players to see and blind players to touch it in order to correctly orient themselves when batting or bowling. Various other modifications to the rules apply. Verbal signals are widely used both by umpires and players: in particular, the bowler must shout 'Play!' as he releases the ball. The delivery is required to pitch at least twice when bowled to a completely blind batsman (once when bowled to a partially sighted batsman), but must not be rolling. Totally blind batsmen cannot be out due to being stumped, and must be found to be LBW twice before going out. Totally blind fielders are allowed to take a catch on the bounce. World Blind Cricket Council (WBCC) The WBCC was established in 1996 during an international cricket meeting held in New Delhi, India in September 1996. The WBCC was set up with the objective of promoting and administering the game of blind cricket globally. Today the WBCC has 10 full members namely Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, West Indies and Nepal. George Abraham of India is the founding Chairman of the WBCC. Under his leadership, the inaugural Blind Cricket World Cup was held in New Delhi in November 1998. Seven countries participated. Peter Donovan of Australia took over as Chairman in 2004. In November 2008, George Abraham was re-elected as President of the WBCC.

The work is considered as the best piece in the medieval genre known as mester de clerec√≠a. The Book begins with prayers and a guide as to how to read the work, followed by stories each containing a moral and often comical tale. The book contains a heterogeneous collection of diverse materials united around a supposed autobiographical narrative of the author's own love affairs, which is represented in one part of the book by the episodic character of don Mel√≥n de la Huerta. In it, all the layers of Spanish low-medieval society are represented through their lovers. In the course of the main plot, fables and apologists are interspersed, constituting a collection of exempla. There are also allegories, morals, sermons, and songs by the blind and schoolchildren of the Goliardesque type. Profane lyrical compositions (serranillas, often parodic, derived from pastorelas) are also collected alongside other religious ones, such as hymns and joys to the Virgin or Christ. The narrative materials are based on the parody of the medieval elegiac comedies in Latin pseudo- Ovidian school environment, such as De vetula and Pamphilus de amore, in which the author is the protagonist of love adventures that alternate with poems linked to them. Pamphilus is also mentioned in the Book of Good Love as the basis for the episode of Don Mel√≥n and Do√±a Endrina. In addition to material derived from Ovid's Ars Amandi, the liturgy of the canonical hours or the chants of deeds are also parodied, as in the battle of Don Carnal with Do√±a Cuaresma. Other genres that can be found in the Book are the plantos, like the one to the death of Trotaconventos, a character that constitutes the clearest precedent of La Celestina or the satires, like those directed against the lady girls or the equalizing power of money; the fables, of the esoteric medieval tradition or pedagogical manuals, like the Facetus, that considers the loving education as part of the human learning. Although Arab sources have been proposed, current criticism is inclined to consider that The Book of Good Love descends from medieval Latin clerical literature.  Manuscripts  There are three manuscripts of the Book of Good Love, none of them complete, whose divergences made Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal think that they could respond to two different redactions made by the author in different moments of his life: * Manuscript \\"S\\" because it came from Salamanca; specifically from the Colegio Mayor de San Bartolom√©. It was once in the Royal Library of Madrid and is now in the Library of the University of Salamanca (ms. 2663). Because of its handwriting, it is from the beginning of the 15th century and is the most complete, as it incorporates additions that are not in the other two. The colophon is attributed to Alonso de Paradinas. * Manuscript \\"G\\", so called because it belonged in his time to Benito Mart√≠nez Gayoso. Today it is in the Library of the Royal Spanish Academy. It is dated at the end of the 15th century. * Manuscript \\"T\\", so called because it belonged to the Cathedral of Toledo. Today guarded in the National Library of Spain. It is considered to have been written at the end of the 14th century. Theme and structure The Book of Good Love is a varied and extensive composition of 1728 stanzas, centering on the fictitious autobiography of Juan Ruiz, Archpriest of Hita. Today three manuscripts of the work survive: the Toledo (T) and Gayoso (G) manuscripts originating from the fourteenth century, and the Salamanca (S) manuscript copied at the start of the fifteenth century by Alonso de Paradinas. All three manuscripts have various pages missing, which prevents a complete reading of the book, and each manuscript varies extensively from each other due to the diversions of the authors. The work most commonly read today was suggested by Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal in 1898 based on sections from all three manuscripts. The book is famous for its variety of: #Content (examples, love stories, traditional bucolic poems, fables, lyrical compositions, etc.) #Meter (the cuaderna v√≠a, sixteen syllabic verses, z√©jel stanzas, etc.) #Tone (serious, festive, religious, profane, etc.) The work is composed of the following: *The introduction, where the author explains how the book should be interpreted. *A fictitious autobiography of the author in which he tells us of his relationships with women of different origin and social status: a nun, a Moor, a housewife he spied praying, a baker, a noble woman and several mountain women (serranas), often helped by another woman named Urraca, better known as Trotaconventos (Trots-between-monasteries) *Several examples (parables, fables and tales) which serve as moral education at the end of each episode. *The dispute between the author and Love (Don Amor), in which he accuses Love of being the cause of the seven mortal sins *The tale of the love of Mr. Melon (don Mel√≥n) and Mrs. Endrina, an adaptation of the medieval elegiac comedy Pamphilus de amore. *The tale of a battle between Carnival (\\"Don Carnal\\") and Lent (\\"Do√±a Cuaresma\\") *A commentary of \\"Ars Amandi\\" (Art of Love) by Ovid *A number of songs dedicated to Mary, mother of Jesus *A number of profane songs, such as that upon the death of \\"Trotaconventos\\" Interpretation The title The Book of Good Love is inferred from the text, and who or what Good Love may be is not revealed by the author. The Book of Good Love explains how men must be careful about Love that can be Good (el buen amor) or Foolish (el loco amor). The Good Love is God's one and is preferred to the Foolish Love which only gives men sins. Juan Ruiz gives the reader a lot of examples to explain his theory and avoid Foolish Love in the name of the Good one.

In its true form it allows the user or administrator to restore data to any point in time. The technique was patented by British entrepreneur Pete Malcolm in 1989 as \\"a backup system in which a copy [editor's emphasis] of every change made to a storage medium is recorded as the change occurs [editor's emphasis].\\" In an ideal case of continuous data protection, the recovery point objective‚Äî\\"the maximum targeted period in which data (transactions) might be lost from an IT service due to a major incident\\"‚Äîis zero, even though the recovery time objective‚Äî\\"the targeted duration of time and a service level within which a business process must be restored after a disaster (or disruption) in order to avoid unacceptable consequences associated with a break in business continuity\\"‚Äîis not zero. An example of a period in which data transactions might be lost is a major discount chain having card readers at its checkout counters shut down at multiple locations for close to two hours in the month of June 2019. CDP runs as a service that captures changes to data to a separate storage location. There are multiple methods for capturing continuous live data changes involving different technologies that serve different needs. True CDP-based solutions can provide fine granularities of restorable objects ranging from crash-consistent images to logical objects such as files, mail boxes, messages, and database files and logs. This isn't necessarily true of near-CDP solutions.  Differences from traditional backup  True continuous data protection is different from traditional backup in that it is not necessary to specify the point in time to recover from until ready to restore. Traditional backups only restore data from the time the backup was made. True continuous data protection, in contrast to \\"snapshots\\", has no backup schedules. When data is written to disk, it is also asynchronously written to a second location, either another computer over the network or an appliance. This introduces some overhead to disk-write operations but eliminates the need for scheduled backups. Allowing restoring data to any point in time, \\"CDP is the gold standard‚Äîthe most comprehensive and advanced data protection. But 'near CDP' technologies can deliver enough protection for many companies with less complexity and cost. For example, snapshots [\\"near-CDP\\" clarification in the section below] can provide a reasonable near-CDP-level of protection for file shares, letting users directly access data on the file share at regular intervals‚Äîsay, every half hour or 15 minutes. That's certainly a higher level of protection than tape-based or disk-based nightly backups and may be all you need.\\" Because \\"near-CDP does this [copying] at pre-set time intervals\\", it is essentially incremental backup initiated‚Äîseparately for each source machine‚Äîby timer instead of script.  Continuous vs near continuous  Since true CDP \\"backup write operations are executed at the level of the basic input/output system (BIOS) of the microcomputer in such a manner that normal use of the computer is unaffected\\", true CDP backup must in practice be run in conjunction with a virtual machine or equivalent‚Äîruling it out for ordinary personal backup applications. It is therefore discussed in the \\"Enterprise client-server backup\\" article, rather than in the \\"Backup\\" article. Some solutions marketed as continuous data protection may only allow restores at fixed intervals such as 15 minutes or one hour or 24 hours, because they automatically take incremental backups at those intervals. Such \\"near- CDP\\"‚Äîshort for near-continuous data protection‚Äîschemes are not universally recognized as true continuous data protection, as they do not provide the ability to restore to any point in time. When the interval is shorter than one hour, \\"near-CDP\\" solutions‚Äîfor example Arq Backup‚Äîare typically based on periodic \\"snapshots\\"; \\"to avoid downtime, high-availability systems may instead perform the backup on ... a read-only copy of the data set frozen at a point in time‚Äîand allow applications to continue writing to their data\\". There is debate in the industry as to whether the granularity of backup must be \\"every write\\" to be CDP, or whether a \\"near-CDP\\" solution that captures the data every few minutes is good enough. The latter is sometimes called near continuous backup. The debate hinges on the use of the term continuous: whether only the backup process must be continuously automatically scheduled, which is often sufficient to achieve the benefits cited above, or whether the ability to restore from the backup also must be continuous. The Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) uses the \\"every write\\" definition. There is a briefer sub-sub-section in the \\"Backup\\" article about this, now renamed to \\"Near-CDP\\" to avoid confusion.  Differences from RAID, replication or mirroring  Continuous data protection differs from RAID, replication, or mirroring in that these technologies only protect one copy of the data (the most recent). If data becomes corrupted in a way that is not immediately detected, these technologies simply protect the corrupted data with no way to restore an uncorrupted version. Continuous data protection protects against some effects of data corruption by allowing restoration of a previous, uncorrupted version of the data. Transactions that took place between the corrupting event and the restoration are lost, however. They could be recovered through other means, such as journaling.  Backup disk size  In some situations, continuous data protection requires less space on backup media (usually disk) than traditional backup. Most continuous data protection solutions save byte or block-level differences rather than file-level differences. This means that if one byte of a 100 GB file is modified, only the changed byte or block is backed up. Traditional incremental and differential backups make copies of entire files; however starting around 2013 enterprise client-server backup applications have implemented a capability for block-level incremental backup, designed for large files such as databases.  Risks and disadvantages  When real-time edits‚Äîespecially in multimedia and CAD design environments‚Äîare backed up offsite over the upstream channel of the installation's broadband network, network bandwidth throttling may be needed to reduce the impact of true CDP. An alternative approach is to back up to a separate Fibre-Channel-connected SAN appliance.

Vordul Megallah), is an American rapper from New York. He is one half of underground hip hop duo Cannibal Ox and a member of the hip hop group Atoms Family. Career Vordul Mega's debut solo album, The Revolution of Yung Havoks, was released in 2004. That same year, Vordul Mega also put out a supplemental compilation LP composed of new and rare work, some of which was not included on Revolution Of Yung Havoks. This second album, titled Yung World, features guest appearances by Aesop Rock, PR Terrorist (also known as Dom Pachino), Keith Masters and Billy Woods. It was released exclusively through Sandbox, an online retailer based in New York City. Vordul's counterpart and fellow Cannibal Ox member Vast Aire appears with Vordul on a track titled \\"Handle That\\" from Vordul's Revolution Of Yung Havoks. Vast Aire released a solo album called Look Mom... No Hands earlier in 2004. Vordul has also been involved in numerous side projects with record labels ranging from Think Differently Music to Backwoodz Studioz to Embedded Music. His work with Billy Woods on the 2002 album Camouflage was billed as a collaborative effort, but has since come to be viewed as Billy Woods' solo debut, despite Vordul's presence on one-third of the tracks. Camouflage's limited pressings, quirky production, and socio-political commentary right after the September 11th attacks garnered some accolades. In 2005, Vordul again collaborated with Backwoodz Studioz as part of a ten-member ensemble of New York based MC's called The Reavers. The Reavers include artists Akir, Vordul Mega, Karniege, Billy Woods, Dom Pachino, Kong, Keith Masters, Goldenchild, Privilege, Hasan Salaam and Spiga. The group thus incorporates members of several New York City crews and collectives including Cannibal Ox, Monsta Island Czars, Backwoodz Studioz, Killarmy, and 5th Column. Terror Firma, The Reavers' debut album, was applauded in some circles for its creativity and gritty aesthetic, despite being poorly received by other critics. Shortly afterwards, Definitive Jux announced that it had signed Vast Aire and Vordul Mega to do a second Cannibal Ox album with El-P. Vordul appeared on Keith Masters' Bioluminescence on the tracks \\"Amongst The Havenots\\" and \\"Where Did Life Go Wrong\\", released in 2005. Vordul also appeared on C-Rayz Walz' Year of the Beast on the track \\"Street Reppin\\". In 2008, Vordul released his second album Megagraphitti. The album was pieced together over the course of 8 years, taking breaks for side projects, and his debut solo album. In 2011, he appeared on the Backwoodz Studios' compilation The Cost of Living on the track \\"Antz\\" also featuring Junclassic and Billy Woods.

In 1845, at age 24, Flaubert visited the Balbi Palace in Genoa, and was inspired by a painting of the same title, then attributed to Bruegel the Elder (now thought to be by one of his followers). Flaubert worked at the subject in three versions, completed in 1849, 1856 (with extracts published at that time) and 1872, before publishing the final version in 1874.

Trifonov is active mainly in the folk music genres but he has experimented with other genres such as hip-hop collaborating with the Australian based producer Yasen Subev, pop-rock and punk as a part of Ku-Ku Band (). His name is associated mainly with the Slavi's Show, Exiles, Canaletto and KU-KU.  Biography Early life= Stanislav Todorov Trifonov was born on 18 October 1966 in Pleven, Bulgaria. His father is from Gorna Mitropoliya, Bulgaria; his mother is Zdravka from Todorovo. He is the youngest of three brothers and has a sister, Petya, three years older than him, who he has said is the person closest to him. He was named after his grandfather Stoyo. He grew up in a strict family where his mother had a major role, and upheld the value of a good education. Trifonov and his sister were excellent students. He enjoyed spending time reading books. Eventually he enrolled in the music school in Pleven. During one of the school holidays, he went to Kaylaka park with his school class. Although uncomfortable, and feeling out of place there, he decided to participate in the talent night during which different performances were presented. Trifonov performed few jokes he had memorized earlier from comedian Dimitar Shkumbata's apocryphal audiotape. Trifonov was surprised by the audience's positive response and their request for an encore. He defines this as turning point in his life. In 1985 graduated from SMU Panayot Pipkov in Pleven having learned the viola. He later graduated from the National Academy of Music in Sofia, Bulgaria. =Filmography= Slavi Trifonov voiced the movie in Bulgarian Dubbin of Angry Bird as The Red Bird.* Angry Birds: –§–∏–ª–º—ä—Ç ‚Äì —á–µ—Ä–≤–µ–Ω–æ—Ç–æ –ø–∏–ª–µ –†–µ–¥ (2016) =Television career= Trifonov, along with Peter Kurumbashev and Lyuben Dilov Jr., was one of the first producers of private programming on Bulgarian National Television (BNT).

Liverpool:The Official Centenary History. p. 108. London: Hamlyn Publishing Group Ltd. . In November 2018, Houlding was commemorated with a bronze bust outside Anfield to mark the 125th anniversary of Liverpool F.C. Biography Houlding was a businessman in the city of Liverpool. He was educated at Liverpool College and was active towards the end of the 19th century, owning a brewery that left him in a comfortable financial state for the rest of his life. He was elected to the Liverpool City Council as a Conservative representing the Everton ward, before being appointed Lord Mayor of Liverpool in 1897. He was also a member of the Orange Order, a Protestant fraternal organization that had a large following in the Liverpool area.David Kennedy Houlding was also a freemason and founded Anfield Lodge No. 2215, he also attended Everton Lodge No. 823 and Hamer Lodge No. 1395. He was Provincial Senior Grand Warden in West Lancashire and, in 1897, was appointed Senior Grand Deacon. Houlding also attained the 33¬∞ of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. Prior to his election Houlding was involved with the city's first professional football team, Everton F.C. In 1882, a ruling forced Everton to play their games at an enclosed ground, having previously played them on the public Stanley Park. A meeting held in the Sandon Hotel in Anfield, Liverpool, owned by Houlding, led to Everton F.C. renting a field off Priory Road. When the owner of this field eventually asked them to leave, Houlding secured a new pitch at Anfield Road, paying a small rent to John Orrell, a fellow brewer. The first football match at Anfield was on 28 September 1884, when Everton beat Earlestown 5-0. At Anfield stands were erected, attendance figures reached 8,000 per game, and Everton became a founding member of the Football League in 1888. However, Houlding was beginning to annoy the club; he increased the rate of interest on his loan to the club, and the players were forced to use the Sandon Hotel in Oakfield Road for changing, both before and after games. Memorial to Houlding outside Anfield on the 125th anniversary of Liverpool F.C. Houlding purchased the land at Anfield Road from Orrell in 1885 and charged rent to Everton F.C. Orrell owned land next to the ground and planned to build an access road across Houlding‚Äôs land. The only way to stop this was to rent Orrell‚Äôs land or buy it. Houlding wanted Everton F.C. to buy his land and Orrell‚Äôs land by floating the club. If his proposals had been accepted, Houlding would have made a lot of money from the purchase of the land and the club would have been run by a small number of large shareholders. Many of the club's members accused Houlding of trying to make a profit at the club's expense. The club's 279 members met in January 1892 to discuss the matter. Following another meeting on 15 March 1892, the club decided to leave Anfield and find a new ground. Later that year Everton F.C. moved to Goodison Park, on the north side of Stanley Park. Houlding and Orrell were left with an empty football ground, and Houlding felt that the only proper course of action would be to found a new football club, which he duly did. The new club was called Everton Athletic but the Football Association would not allow this name to be used due to its similarity to the original club, so the new club was renamed Liverpool F.C. Their first ever Liverpool F.C. game was a friendly match with Rotherham Town, then of the Midland League, on 1 September 1892. Houlding died following a lengthy illness in 1902 in Cimiez, southern France in his 69th year.Williams, John (2010), Red Men: Liverpool Football Club - The Biography. Mainstream Publishing. . At his funeral, players of both Liverpool and Everton carried his coffin as a mark of respect for all he had done for football in the city. In November 2018, Houlding was commemorated with a bronze bust, which stands at just under 7 feet, outside Anfield, to mark the 125th anniversary of Liverpool F.C.

It was Pentax's flagship professional SLR until the introduction of the Pentax LX. Internally, the MX is essentially a smaller, lighter version of the Pentax KX, and otherwise has little in common with the rest of the Pentax M-series. However, the MX was designed as the mechanical twin sister of the remarkably successful entry-level Pentax ME. The MX was solidly built, and featured a fully mechanical construction, including a mechanical shutter of the horizontal cloth type. Only the light metering system was dependent on batteries. The MX is all manual: it does not feature autofocus or autoexposure modes such as aperture-priority, shutter-speed priority, or full program. A number of accessories were produced, among those: Focusing Screens * SC1: ground glass, split image device, microprism ring (standard) * SA1: ground glass, microprism patch * SA3: ground glass, microprism patch, for wide aperture lenses * SB1: ground glass, split image device * SD1: ground glass, cross collimator * SD11: aerial image, cross collimator * SE: ground glass * SG: ground glass, grid * SI: ground glass, axis, Data backs, Dial Data MX and a bulk film back.

Like all post-42 mm screwmount Pentax cameras, the MX accepts all K-mount lenses (with the exception of the newer FA-J and DA lenses without aperture rings). Due to its complete lack of automatic functions, but excellent array of manual controls, the MX is often selected as a camera for photography students to practice their technique.

It is one of very few brochs found in southern Scotland.Armit, I. (2003) Towers in the North: The Brochs of Scotland. Stroud. Tempus. pp119-132. It is roughly 28 metres in diameter. Name In the late 18th century this site was called \\"Wooden's Hall or Castle\\" (Woden the chief god from Anglo-Saxon mythology).John R. Baldwin (1985) Lothian and the Borders, page 132. RCAHMS. Its later name change apparently recalls the legend of the three-headed giant The Red Ettin known in tales and ballads. Location Edin's Hall Broch is one of the most southerly broch survivals, which are more typically associated with Northern Scotland. It is 4 miles north of the town of Duns. It stands on the northeast slope of Cockburn Law just above a fairly steep slope down to the Whiteadder Water. The broch stands in the northwest corner an Iron Age hillfort which presumably pre-dates the broch. The hillfort consists of a double rampart and ditches, enclosing an oval area some 135 metres by 75 metres. The entrance was on the west side. A large circular structure (roundhouse) in the centre of the fort, close to the broch, may have been the most important building before the broch‚Äôs construction. Dating It is assumed that the hillfort dates to the pre-Roman Iron Age. The date of the broch is uncertain but it has been speculated that it was built between the two main periods of Roman occupation in Scotland: some time in the 2nd century AD. Excavations at Torwoodlee Broch, also in the Scottish Borders, has shown that it was built and demolished during this period. Within the hillfort is an array of stone footings marking the positions of houses and other structures. Some of the houses overlie the defences ‚Äì indicating that they are later than hillfort and may be later than the broch as well. Description Entrance passage Stairs in the south wall of the broch The broch has an external diameter of 28 metres, and an internal diameter of 17 metres. This is unusually large compared with a typical Highland broch and suggests that it may not have been as tall as the northern brochs. The walls of the broch survive to a height of between 1.0 and 1.8 metres. The entrance passage is on the east side and has two guard chambers flanking the doorway. The interior of the broch has three intramural cells which are all approximately dumb-bell shaped. The cell on the south side has the remains of a stone stairway at its north end which presumably rose to the wallhead. The broch lies within a rectangular enclosure measuring about 58 by 54 metres. Excavations Edin's Hall was \\"cleared\\" by antiquarians in the 19th century. The relics recovered were donated to the National Museum of Scotland. These included a stone spindle whorl, a piece of a jet ring, an amber bead, bones, an oyster shell, and a fragment of a glass bracelet. Two copper ingots, one of which is now in the National Museum, were apparently found with a metal detector inside the broch in 1976. The ingots were derived from local copper mines and may have been an important source of wealth for the inhabitants. An archaeological survey and sample excavation was conducted in 1996. A few artefacts including coarse pottery and a stone spindle whorl were recovered.

There is also a branch line to . Passenger services are operated by Abellio Greater Anglia. It is a part of Network Rail Strategic Route 5, SRS 05.07, 05.08 and part of SRS 07.03. More detailed history of the Ipswich to Stowmarket section can be found under the Great Eastern Main Line entry. HistoryEarly history= The Eastern Union Railway had built a line from Colchester to Ipswich and a number of directors from the EUR formed a new company, the Ipswich and Bury Railway, chaired by John Chevallier Cobbold to build a line from Ipswich to Bury St Edmunds which was known as the \\"Bury extension\\". It was granted parliamentary approval on 21 July 1845 and the first train ran on 26 November 1846. The stations at Bramford, Claydon, Needham, Stowmarket, Haughley Road, Elmswell and Thurston all opened on this date. Bury St Edmunds was served by a temporary station east of the current site with the main station opening in November 1847. The Ipswich and Bury Railway was formally merged with the Eastern Union Railway on 9 July 1847. The 'Newmarket Railway' was built by the Newmarket and Chesterford Railway with the first section from Newmarket to meet the West Anglia Main Line at Great Chesterford opened in 1848. The intermediate stations at and opened at this time. In addition to the new line from Chesterford, the Newmarket Railway also stated constructing a line from Cambridge to Newmarket. The original route diverged form the main platform at Cambridge on a sharp curve and was the cause of operational difficulties for many years. In July 1849 the Eastern Union Railway's extension to Norwich opened and a new station called Haughley was opened located just east of the junction. Haughley Road closed the same week. The Newmarket Railway then intended building extensions through to Bury St Edmunds, Ely and Thetford and a parliamentary Act of 1847 gave approval for this. The Eastern Counties Railway (ECR), who ran the competing (and longer) route via Cambridge, Ely and Thetford, opposed this fearing a loss of Norwich traffic to this more direct route. The ECR also operated the London Liverpool Street to Cambridge route at this time and were in a position to make things difficult for the Newmarket Railway which ceased operations in June 1850. However, under the leadership of bankruptcy commissioner Cecil Fane, the company was re-established in September of the same year and instead the line from Six Mile Bottom to Cambridge was completed using the track from the Chesterford‚ÄìSix Mile Bottom section. This line then opened on 9 September 1850 and the Chesterford route closed. Generally its is assumed the new stations at Fulbourne and Cherryhinton opened on the same date but Robertson, Wislon and Harley suggest that because they did not appear in the Bradshaws until the following August, that might be the correct date for those stations opening. The Newmarket Railway then set its sights on building a line to Bury to link onto the EUR line (although the original plan was for a separate station) although the powers granted by the original act lapsed. The Newmarket Railway was in financial trouble and in 1852 the ECR was granted parliamentary permission to buy the Newmarket Railway. It completed this in 1854, the same year it also took over operation of the EUR. Such was the enthusiasm for the railway, that the first sod was cut by the Newmarket Railway with great ceremony on 16 June 1852 before the necessary parliamentary powers had been granted. The line was completed early in 1854 and opened to traffic on 15 March of that year. As well as new stations at Higham, Saxby & Risby and Kennett, a 1,010 yard tunnel was required through Warren Hill at Newmarket and the engine shed at Bury that originally stood at the west end of the branch from Ipswich, was re-sited to allow the opening of the new line. At Newmarket, trains from Cambridge arrived into the original 1848 terminus and would then reverse out before continuing the journey towards Bury St Edmunds (and they had to do the same in the opposite direction). 1854 also saw the closure of Cherryhinton station on 1 May. =The Ely‚ÄìNewmarket Railway and GER operation (1862‚Äì1922)= By the 1860s the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble, and most were leased to the ECR; they wished to amalgamate formally, but could not obtain government agreement for this until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway was formed by amalgamation. Thus the Ipswich to Cambridge line was operated by the Great Eastern Railway from 1862. In 1874 two rival schemes were put before Parliament. The Ely and Newmarket Railway (ENR) scheme was backed by the GER, whilst the other scheme ‚Äì the Ely and Bury Light Railway ‚Äì was to run via Soham and Mildenhall. Parliament approved the ENR scheme and granted running powers to the Ely and Bury Light Railway from Ely to Soham which was covered by the ENR proposal and their route could then be constructed from there to Bury St Edmunds. In the event nothing more came of this second scheme. The line between Cambridge and Newmarket was doubled in 1875. The ENR act was passed in 1875 and construction began soon after, under the guidance of engineer George Hopkins and contractor John Waddell. Although an inaugural train carrying various GER officers ran on 6 June 1879, the line failed to pass the mandatory government inspection and it was not until 1 September that the line opened. The opening day was not auspicious, as a locomotive was derailed near Soham, without casualties. One of the first trains to use the new link was a train carrying racehorses from Newmarket to Doncaster. From the outset the single track line was operated by the GER, and Fordham and Soham stations (both equipped with goods yards) all opened on 1 September 1879. At the same time as the ENR line opened, a new low level island platform was provided at Newmarket to remove the need for trains to reverse into and out of the old terminal station. This station then primarily became a goods station, although it was used by passenger services on race days, and was linked to the new platform by a footbridge. Provision for passengers on the new platform was not overgenerous at first, leading to a number of complaints in the local newspapers. The GER provided a waiting room in 1881. There was still no direct line between Bury St Edmunds and Ely, so trains had to reverse in the Newmarket area. A link was provided with a new line between Chippenham Junction (west of Kennett) station and Snailwell Junction on the ENR opened on 1 September 1880. The GER built four cottages at Snailwell Junction in 1882 for local staff. THE GER started operating the \\"North Country Continental\\" train over the route between Parkeston and Manchester in 1883. On 2 June 1884 Fordham became a railway junction when the first section of the Mildenhall branch opened. The line through to Mildenhall opened on 1 April 1885. A new station to cater for racegoers was opened at Newmarket Warren Hill (just north of the tunnel) on 4 April 1885. This was primarily for people attending race meetings at Newmarket arriving from the north and east with those from the south using the original terminal station. Warren Hill was not a through station but a two-platformed terminus station with some associated carriage sidings. On 4 January 1887 the ENR was leased to the GER and in 1898 was fully vested. A new junction at Coldham Junction Cambridge was opened and the approach to Cambridge improved with the new arrangements coming onto force on 17 May 1896. The current Newmarket station was opened by the Great Eastern Railway on 7 April 1902 and located south of the site of the original Newmarket station. The 1879 platform closed at this time. =London and North Eastern Railway (1923‚Äì1947)= Following the grouping of 1923 the lines became part of the London & North Eastern Railway. Despite being a heavily used section of line it remained single until 1938 when the section between Soham and Snailwell Junction was doubled. This was fortuitous as the route carried significant traffic during the Second World War to the many airbases located in East Anglia. Indeed, it was one of these trains that was involved in the accident detailed below. Between 1945 and 1948 Newmarket Warren Hill station was closed to passengers although it is believed the last train ran in August 1938. The platforms and sidings remained in situ. =British Railways (1948‚Äì1994)= In 1948 as a result of nationalisation of the railways the route became part of British Railways Eastern Region. The Bury Free Press reported on 2 January 1959 that all local passenger services between Cambridge and Ipswich would now be operated by Diesel Multiple Units. The Mildenhall branch closed in 1962 (Fordham‚ÄìMildenhall) and 1964 (Cambridge Barnwell Junction to Fordham) and this was followed by Fordham station on 13 September 1965 although freight traffic lasted a further year until 12 September 1966. Soham station also closed to passengers on 13 September 1965. The sidings at Warren Hill were removed in the early 1960s although the platform remained until the 1980s. Goods facilities were withdrawn from Dullingham and Saxham & Risby on 28 December 1964. It is believed that the Warren Hill Junction‚ÄìSnailwell Junction probably closed on this date as well with the cessation of passenger traffic although by this time Snailwell Junction signal box was only opened in the morning at this time and the evening Ely-Newmarket service had to reverse at Chippenham Junction as the direct route was not available. However the line may have survived (for freight?) until 2 February 1966 which was when Warren Hill signal box closed, although with the line being singled at this time, whether any trains actually ran via the Warren Hill Junction to Snailwell Junction curve is unknown. Warren Hill Tunnel was only ever single track. On 5 August 1966 the Suffolk Mercury reported that Mrs Barbara Castle the Minister of Transport, had given approval for the closure of the stations at Fulbourne, Six Mile Bottom, Dullingham, Kennet, Higham, Saxham & Risby, Thurston and Elmswell. The closures were to take effect from 5 November that year but on 4 October it was announced that Dullingham, Kennet, Thurston and Elmswell would remain open. On 2 January 1967 Fulbourne, Higham, Six Mile Bottom and Saxby & Risby stations closed and the remaining minor stations became unstaffed with the introduction of conductor guard working. On 21 February 1967 the last shunting horse to work on British Rail, \\"Charlie\\" at Newmarket retired. Needham station was closed in 1967 but reopened in 1971 as Needham Market. Newmarket Goods Yard was also closed on 2 February 1969 with Snailwell Junction Signal Box closing a week later. Further line rationalisation took place in 1978 when on 1 October tokenless block working was introduced between Newmarket and Dullingham stations. Five years later in May 1983 the line between Dullingham and Coldham Lane Junction was singled leaving a mile long passing loop at Dullingham. Although general goods services were withdrawn from Thurston in 1967 coal trains ran until early 1976 (usually the Bury st Edmunds diesel shunter worked this train). The yard was lifted on 1 June 1976. Upon sectorisation in 1982 Provincial (renamed Regional Railways in 1989) became responsible for all local passenger services. =The privatisation era= In April 1994 Railtrack became responsible for the maintenance of the infrastructure. Railtrack was succeeded by Network Rail in 2002. Passenger services have been operated by the following franchises: * April 1994 ‚Äì December 1996 Operated as a non-privatised business unit under the InterCity name * January 1997 ‚Äì March 2004 Anglia Railways ‚Äì owned by GB Railways but bought out by FirstGroup in 2003 \\"GB Railways wins Anglia\\" The Railway Magazine issue 1149 January 1997 page 11National Express wins rail franchise The Daily Telegraph 22 December 2003 * April 2004 ‚Äì February 2012 National Express East AngliaNational Express Group Announced as Preferred Bidder for new Greater Anglia Franchise Strategic Rail Authority 22 December 2003National Express wins rail franchise The Telegraph 22 December 2003 * March 2013 ‚Äì present Abellio Greater Anglia Infrastructure The line shares the route between Ipswich and Haughley Junction with the Great Eastern Main Line which is classified as primary line. The section between Haughley Junction and Ely is classified as secondary line with the Cambridge branch being classified as rural. The line from Ipswich to Soham, part way between Kennett and Ely is double track with the remainder, plus the Cambridge branch, being single track (with a passing loop at ). Where the line is separate from the Great Eastern Main Line it is not electrified and has a line speed of between 40-75 mph. It has a loading gauge of W10 between Ipswich and Ely with the Cambridge branch being W8. Passenger services The summer 2015 passenger services, both operated by Abellio Greater Anglia, are: * Ipswich‚ÄìCambridge (hourly) * Ipswich‚ÄìPeterborough (two-hourly) Some services are extended to Harwich Parkeston Quay. Proposed developments The line between Kennett and Ely will be doubled as part of the Felixstowe and Nuneaton freight capacity scheme. In January 2013, Network Rail released a five-year upgrade plan, which included reopening Soham station as part of improvements to the Ipswich‚ÄìEly line.\\"Region to benefit from huge railways investment\\" East Anglian Daily Times, 8 January 2013 This station was approved in 2020, and will open in 2022. It has long been envisaged that the Ipswich to Cambridge route would become part of the east-west rail scheme but it is unclear whether this will see double track laid throughout and through services from stations in the west of England such as Oxford operating. Reopening of Cherryhinton and Fulbourn stations was proposed by Cambridgeshire County Council in May 2013 as part of an infrastructure plan to deal with projected population growth up to 2050. IncidentsThurston 1850= On 4 October 1850 the locomotive due to work the 0800 departure from Bury had to be withdrawn from service due to a technical failure. The station master at Bury knew an engine would be sent from Ipswich to investigate the situation (this being normal practice in the days before telegraph communication between stations). To save time four horses were connected to the two-coach train to pull it along the line to meet the loco coming from Ipswich. To enable them to see the relief train at the earliest opportunity Bury Stationmaster Hartwell and a porter William Baldwin climbed on to the roof of the first carriage and they were joined at Thurston by stationmaster James Wolton. Just east of Thurston station the horse drawn train met the relief engine and the horses ere removed. The three men remained sitting on the carriage roof and a little further east the two stationmasters who had been facing Bury were hit by the bridge as the train passed under it. Wolton and Hartwell were killed whilst Baldwin survived. =Fulbourn 1862= There was a fatal accident involving a goods train one mile from the station. =Dullingham 1873= On 29 April 1873 the rear portion of the train ran away and came to a stand beyond Six-Mile Bottom station (the bottom of a gradient) because insufficient brakes had been pinned down by the guard. Fortunately there was no loss of life. =Fulbourn 1926= On 22 September 1936 an aeroplane made a forced landing on the railway line between Fulbourn and Six Mile Bottom. The Fulbourn signalman was instrumental in saving the life of the pilot. =East of Cambridge 1883= On 23 October 1883 a low-speed collision occurred at the junction where the double line from Newmarket became single track. The train from the Newmarket direction failed to stop at a ticket platform. The driver of the other train, seeing the collision was imminent, attempted to draw his train clear but to no avail. His was the only injury (a broken leg) as both trains were lightly loaded. The driver of the Newmarket train was blamed for the accident. =Thurston 1944= On 12 January 1944 a freight train service from Ipswich to Whitemoor hauled by USA Engine No 2363 was approaching Thurston at 1240 am when the crown of the steel firebox collapsed due to the shortage of water. The fireman H W Leek was blown from the footplate by the force of the explosion and suffered severe bruising, burns and shock whilst the driver Mr W Nicholls sustained serious injuries including a broken thigh and burns on his left side. =Soham 1944= The Soham rail disaster where an ammunition train exploded during World War II occurred on 2 June 1944. =Dullingham 1973= On 17 May 1973 two Class 31 locomotives struck a track machine killing the operator. =Freight train derailment June 2007= All traffic on the line was suspended for six months following a freight train derailed on the bridge over the River Great Ouse between Ely and Soham on 22 June 2007. The bridge was severely damaged and closed to all traffic while it was rebuilt. Rail replacement buses operated between Bury St Edmunds, Ely, March, Whittlesey and Peterborough for the duration until the section of line re-opened on 21 December 2007.

In Croatia and Slovenia, the Roman Catholic version of Saint George's Day, Jurjevo is celebrated on 23 April by the Gregorian calendar. Saint George is one of the most important saints in the Eastern Orthodox tradition. He is the patron military saint in Slavic, Georgian and Circassian, Cossack, Chetnik military tradition. Christian synaxaria hold that Saint George was a martyr who died for his faith. On icons, he is usually depicted as a man riding a horse and killing a dragon. Beyond Orthodox Christian tradition proper, ƒêurƒëevdan is also more generically a spring festival in the Balkans. South Slavic tradition ƒêurƒëevi stupovi, Orthodox church dedicated to Saint George, built by Serbian king Stefan Nemanja in the 12th century. Saint George's Day, known as ƒêurƒëevdan () in Serbian, is a feast day celebrated on 6 May (O.S. 23 April) in the Eastern Orthodox Church. As such, it is celebrated on that date by the Serb community in former Yugoslavia and in the Serb diaspora. It is also one of the many family slavas. The day is celebrated and known as Gergyovden in Bulgaria and Gjurgovdjen in Macedonia. ƒêurƒëevdan is also a major holiday for the Romani communities in former Yugoslavia, whether Orthodox or Muslim. The various spellings used by the Romani (Ederlezi, Herdeljez, Erdelezi) for it are variants of the Turkish Hƒ±dƒ±rellez. It is also celebrated by the Slavic Muslim community of Gorani in Kosovo, and by members of the uncanonical Montenegrin Orthodox Church. The holiday's rituals and festivities are related to the legend of St. George who is pictured as a brave young knight on a white horse slaying a dragon and saving a young maiden. The holiday celebrates the return of springtime and is considered an important one. Celebrations are closely associated with pagan rituals and festivities associated with the awakening of nature and arrival of spring, dominant in the Balkans but also present in Europe. These rituals primarily consisted of sheep grazing, ritual slaughtering of a lamb, preparation of various dishes, ritual bath in the river or springs, setting of live fires, decorating with greenery and flowers and conducting of love spells. About a third of the population in Serbia have St. George as a patron saint, meaning that St. George's Day or ƒêurƒëevdan is celebrated as a krsna slava, through a family feast with ritual glorification. A popular tradition on St. George's eve is decorating home gates and houses with greens and flowers, this is particularly done by families whose patron saint is St. George. A common way ƒêurƒëevdan is celebrated by Serbs is by \\"preparing a container of roses and green foliage, with an egg placed in the centre. Fresh water is poured over the flowers, and if the weather is kind enough, the container is placed in the garden. Children will be encouraged to wash their faces in this water and wishes for their good health are made by parents and grandparents.\\" In Serbia, the celebration is linked to the end of Turkish rule, recollecting the days when fighters made plots and plans in woodland hideouts. In the past, the date was used by the fighters for gathering and organizing their units for campaigns, leading to battles up until the end of November when they disbanded and returned to their villages to await the arrival of spring again, when trees turned new leaves. Thus another custom is spending the day in nature. Other traditions in some parts of Serbia include the ritual sacrifice of lamb, bathing children in spring flowers and blossoms or nettles and herbs. The Prayer under Mid≈æor Mt. Peak is a festival which has been organized since 2000 in the village of Vrtovac and includes prayer, national dances, local cuisine contests and other cultural events. Serbs around the world also celebrate with singing, music, dancing and sporting events. The traditions of the Roma Durƒëevdan are based on decorating the home with flowers and blooming twigs as a welcoming to spring. It also includes taking baths added with flowers, washing hands with water from church wells and cracking painted eggs. Also the walls of the home could be washed with the water. On the day of the feast it is most common to grill a lamb for the feast dinner. The inclusion of music is also important during the holiday; dancing and singing is common as are performances from traditional brass bands. In Bulgaria, May 6 is celebrated as St. George's Day as well as the Day of the Bulgarian Army with a military parade. St. George is considered the patron of spring verdure and fertility, and of shepherds and farmers. Cattle rituals are performed, including the sacrificing of a lamb, offered to the saint. Villagers perform the traditional Bulgarian chain dance Holo, bathe in morning dew and \\"drink three sips of silent water from local springs as a cure\\" while a ritual meal is placed on a large table for the whole village. In Macedonia, the harvesting of herbs is an important symbolic act, done in St. George's day eve or early morning on the day. It is through this that various customs and songs are performed. At its core, the Macedonian tradition is in \\"the celebration of nature, the awakening of vegetation and life in general.\\" Some of the herbs which are picked are believed to be magical. Similar to Bulgarian and Serbian customs, they are \\"aimed at ensuring progress and fertility of goods and fields, health, happiness and progress of people\\". Pilgrimages to holy sites devoted to St. George are also done in some villages. In Croatia, the feast day of Jurjevo is celebrated on 23 April by the Roman Catholic Croats mainly in the rural areas of Turopolje and Gornja Stubica. In Croatian George is called Juraj while in Serbian he's called ƒêorƒëe (); in Bulgarian Georgi () and in Macedonian «¥or«µija (). The use of bonfires is similar to Walpurgis Night. In Turopolje, Jurjevo involves a Slavic tradition where five most beautiful girls are picked to play as Dodola goddesses dressed in leaves and sing for the village every day till the end of the holiday. In Bosnia, the major holidays of all religious groups were celebrated by all other religious groups as well, at least until religion- specific holidays became a marker of ethnic or nationalist self-assertion after the breakup of Yugoslavia. Roman Catholic Christmas, Orthodox Christmas, and the two Muslim Bajrams were widely recognized by people of all ethnic groups, as was √êurƒëevdan even though it was properly an Orthodox holiday and therefore associated with Serbs. Muslims in Bosnia referred to the holiday as Jurjev and many celebrated it, while those who lived primarily in mixed Muslim and Orthodox villages did not. The holiday's widespread appeal, beyond the Orthodox Christian groups, in the Balkans, is evidenced in Me≈°a Selimoviƒá's novel Death and the Dervish, where the pious Muslim protagonist views it as a dangerous pagan throwback, but where it is clearly celebrated by all ethnic groups in the unnamed city of its setting (widely considered to be Sarajevo). \\"√êurƒëevdan\\" is also the name of a popular song by band Bijelo dugme. The song is originally found on their studio album ƒÜiribiribela from 1988. It is a cover song (with different lyrics) for a popular traditional folk song of the Romani, \\"Ederlezi\\". Which was largely made famous by Goran Bregoviƒá. Eastern Slavic tradition Yuri's Day in the Spring. Lubok. Yuri's Day of Spring ( or , ) is the Russian name for either of the two feasts of Saint George celebrated by the Russian Orthodox Church. Along with various other Christian churches, the Russian Orthodox Church celebrates the feast of Saint George on April 23 (Julian calendar), which falls on May 6 of the Western (Gregorian calendar. In addition to this, the Russian Church also celebrates the anniversary of the consecration of the Church of St George in Kiev by Yaroslav the Wise (1051) on November 26 (Julian calendar), which currently falls on December 9. One of the Russian forms of the name George being Yuri, the two feasts are popularly known as Vesenniy Yuriev Den (, \\"Yuri's Day in the Spring\\") and Osenniy Yuriev Den (, \\"Yuri's Day in Autumn\\").

It usually insures a business for losses caused by the dishonest acts of its employees. While called bonds, these obligations to protect an employer from employee-dishonesty losses are really insurance policies. These insurance policies protect from losses of company monies, securities, and other property from employees who have a manifest intent to i) cause the company to sustain a loss and ii) obtain an improper financial benefit, either for themselves or another party. There are also many other coverage extensions available through the purchase of additional insuring agreements. These are common to most crime insurance policies (burglary, fire, general theft, computer theft, disappearance, fraud, forgery, etc.) and are designed to further protect specific company assets. First-Party Vs. Third-Party Fidelity Bonds There are two types of fidelity bonds: first-party and third- party. First-party fidelity bonds protect businesses against intentionally wrongful acts (fraud, theft, forgery, etc.) committed by employees of that business. Third-party fidelity bonds protect businesses against intentionally wrongful acts committed by people working for them on a contract basis (e.g., consultants or independent contractors). In business partnerships, it is the responsibility of the business working as a contractor or subcontractor to carry third-party fidelity bond coverage, though it is typically the other party who requests or requires such coverage. In many cases, businesses in finance or banking require their contractors to carry third-party fidelity bond coverage to prevent losses from theft. Commercial Crime Vs. Financial Institution Bonds The fidelity bond marketplace is, generally speaking, split into two main type of policies; financial institution bonds (to protect financial institutions such as banks, stock brokers, insurance companies etc.) and commercial crime policies (non-financial institutions). Within each category there are different policy forms designed for specific types of institutions. These include: * Financial Institution Bonds, Standard Form No. 14 for Brokers/Dealers * Financial Institution Bonds, Standard Form No. 15 for Mortgage Bankers and Finance Companies * Credit Union Blanket Bond, Standard Form No. 23 for Credit Unions * Financial Institution Bonds, Standard Form No. 24 for Commercial Banks, Savings Banks and Savings and Loan Associations * Financial Institution Bonds, Standard Form No. 25 for Insurance Companies * Commercial Crime Policy * Commercial Crime Policy for Public Entities  Emerging Trends  Fidelity insurers need to not only understand the threat posed to companies from traditional elements such as employee dishonesty, robbery or cheque forgery, they need to stay informed of emerging trends or evolving threat vectors. = Social Engineering Fraud = Also known as Business Email Compromise or Impersonation Fraud (and by a variety of other names), this fraud typically involves someone close to the insured company (an employee, an executive, a vendor or a client) being impersonated - often quite convincingly - and tricking the company into transferring funds to the fraudster. These funds are often then quickly transferred offshore making recovery very challenging. Despite the pervasiveness of this threat (the FBI estimates that since January 2015 over $3 billion have been lost by companies around the world to this scam), most traditional insurance policies do not cover this type of loss. Many policyholders have challenged insurance company's assertions that this is not a covered loss in court, however a string of recent North American cases support the insurers' positions, notably American Tooling Center, Inc. v. Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America, The Brick Warehouse LP v. Chubb Insurance Company of Canada, and Taylor & Lieberman v. Federal Insurance Company.

It is a non-contiguous collection of parcels in the vicinity of the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge. The refuge was established in 1989 to help the recovery of two federally listed species: the endangered Iowa Pleistocene Snail and threatened plant Northern Wild Monkshood. Although the refuge was established to protect the snail and flower, an entire rare community of plants and animals is preserved on these sites. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages the refuge as part of the National Wildlife Refuge system. Currently, the refuge consists of nine sites totaling in four counties of Iowa only. In descending order of land area they are Clayton, Dubuque, Jackson, and Allamakee counties. Geology Algific talus slopes along Howard Creek at Driftless Area National Wildlife Refuge, May 2018 Iowa Pleistocene Snail, Discus macclintocki Portions of Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois contain unusual geology. The karst region, referred to as the \\"Driftless Area\\", escaped the last glaciers leaving the Paleozoic-age bedrock subject to erosion. In addition to the curious topography of steep slopes and cliffs, there are unique habitats. Certain slopes, usually north facing, are covered with a talus layer that allows ice- cooled air to exit from underground cracks and fissures. Upland sinkholes contribute to the air flow regime and are an important component of a unique system called an algific talus slopes, meaning a cold producing rocky slope. Even on a midsummer day when the outside air temperature is 90 ¬∞F (32 ¬∞C), ground temperatures on these slopes range from 42 ¬∞F (6 ¬∞C) to about 55 ¬∞F (13 ¬∞C). Although the slopes will freeze in winter, the temperatures are moderated. These slopes remain cool throughout the year and are home to rare species of plants and animals. Chilled air In the summer, air is drawn down through sinkholes, flows over very cold groundwater and is released out vents on the slopes. Summer temperatures on the slopes range from to . In winter, the air is drawn into the vents, and the groundwater again freezes. Because of the cool temperatures and moist conditions, unusual plants for this part of the country grow on the slopes. Typically growing in a colder more northern climate, yews, balsam fir, Showy lady's slipper and golden saxifrage can be found on the cool slopes. These cold microclimates of the slopes allow the rare plants and animals to survive. Fossil snail A tiny land snail, the Iowa Pleistocene snail, is smaller than a shirt button, at about 5 millimeters (1/4 inch) in diameter. Considered a glacial relict species, it has survived only on these small areas where temperature, moisture and food are suitable. The snail was known only from fossil records and thought to be extinct until 1955, when a scientist discovered it alive in leaf litter in northeast Iowa, eating birch and maple leaves. Because of the fragile nature of the habitat and the small size of the total population, this snail was placed on the federal endangered species list. The primary recovery option for the tiny snail is permanent protection of remaining colonies. Thirty-six known colonies are currently in northeast Iowa with one population occurring in northwest Illinois. Threatened buttercup Northern monkshood The threatened Northern Wild Monkshood, belonging to the buttercup family, grows on 114 algific talus slopes and similar cool moist habitats in Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio and New York. The majority of the sites are in Iowa. The purple hood-shaped flower, an adaptation for bumble bee pollination, was listed as threatened in 1978. Its options for recovery are similar to the snail. Habitat status There are over 300 algific talus slopes but some are in poor condition. Anything disrupting the air flow through sinkholes and out the vents can affect the habitat. In the past, the impacts of logging, grazing, road building, quarries, agricultural runoff, and sinkhole filling reduced the number of algific talus slopes. Today, these habitats are still threatened by logging, grazing, agricultural runoff, and sinkhole filling activities and invasive species like garlic mustard. Refuge locations The refuge currently consists of scattered tracts in northeast Iowa ranging from a few acres to a few hundred acres. Land acquisition from willing sellers is ongoing. Restoration of forest or prairie habitat is conducted on the land surrounding algific talus slopes and provides habitat for a variety of wildlife including white-tailed deer, wild turkeys, bald eagles, American woodcock, woodpeckers and a variety of songbirds. States, counties, and private organizations like The Nature Conservancy also help protect algific talus slopes. Private landowners are perhaps the most significant stewards of remaining algific talus slopes. The Fish and Wildlife Service contacts land owners whose properties have these habitats and offers assistance in managing them. The Refuge is managed from McGregor, Iowa, where tours can be arranged. Fishing and White-tailed deer hunting are permitted in a small number of units.

McBride made his debut in Liverpool's first ever fixture, a friendly against Rotherham Town on 1 September 1892, which Liverpool won 7-1. He also played in their first ever competitive match, a Lancashire League fixture against Higher Walton two days later. He scored his first goal for Liverpool in this game, which the team won 8-0. McBride was a regular during Liverpool's unbeaten debut season in the Football League Second Division, missing just 4 of the 28 games. Liverpool gained promotion to the top flight of English football, replacing Newton Heath by winning 2-0 in a test (play-off) match.

Built in the 1880s, it was the first market street to be lit by electric lights. Today, the street contains several butchers and fish mongers and hosts a part of Brixton Market, which specializes in selling a mix of African, Caribbean, South American and Asian products. It is located just around the corner from Brixton Underground station (1972). The elegant Victorian canopies over the pavements survived until the 1980s. History The road gave its name to Eddy Grant's 1983 single \\"Electric Avenue\\", which reached #2 on both the UK and U.S. singles charts. The song was inspired by the 1981 Brixton riot. On 17 April 1999 the neo-Nazi bomber David Copeland planted a nail bomb outside a supermarket in Brixton Road with the intention of igniting a race war across Britain. A market trader was suspicious and moved it round the corner to a less crowded area in Electric Avenue. The bomb went off, injuring 39 people.

He focuses in particular on figures and still life. Life and career Veltman won his first art prize at the age of 12, at an international exhibition of children's drawings in Brazil. In 1958, when he was 19, he exhibited his own interpretations of the Suriname rainforest. He went on to study at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam. From the early 1960s Veltman exhibited extensively at art galleries in the Netherlands and sometimes beyond. Veltman uses many drawing and painting techniques, often in mixtures. He is also active in sculpting, ceramics and art research. He is still influenced by spending some of his youth in South America. Since 1966 he lived mostly in Dordrecht, with a short interlude in Amerongen. He taught many students painting and drawing, both in Dordrecht and at Ichthus College in Rotterdam.

In 1999, they decided to change their musical style to gothic metal, changing their band name as well. The band disbanded on 13 April 2009, but has reformed as of 4 July 2009, and played their final concert at John Smith Festival in Finland on June 22, 2016. They reformed once again in early 2020. Band historyMary-Ann (1993 - 1999)= To/Die/For was formed under the name Mary-Ann in 1993. They released two demo EPs, \\"Mary-Ann\\" in 1997 and \\"Deeper Sin\\" in 1998, before changing name as they modified musical style from heavy metal to gothic metal in 1999. \\"Deeper Sin\\" thereby resulted in a record deal with Spinefarm Records. =All Eternity / Epilogue (1999 - 2002)= Their debut album - All Eternity - was released in Finland by the end of 1999, and the band then signed contracts with Nuclear Blast (for Europe) and Pony Canyon (for Japan). Their cover of the Sandra song In the Heat of the Night was to be the only single, and together with \\"Farewell\\" it was recorded as a music video, and obtained a fair amount of exposure. In 2000, the band toured Europe together with Dark Tranquillity, Sentenced and In Flames. Bassist Miikka Kuisma quit the band and was replaced by Marko Kangaskolkka, who had played with the band in its early years. \\"Epilogue\\", the successor of \\"All Eternity\\", was released in 2001, and was followed by a tour with Lacrimosa. =Jaded / IV / Wounds Wide Open (2003 - 2009)= The album \\"Jaded\\" was released in 2003, and is by many fans still seen as their best effort. In August of that year, vocalist Jarno Per√§talo left the band. He assembled a new band named Tiaga, integrated by former members of To/Die/For. Juha Kylm√§nen (from For My Pain and Reflexion) then assumed the vocals of To/Die/For. However, in 2004, Jarno Per√§talo and the band Tiaga took the name To/Die/For themselves, releasing the fourth album, simply entitled \\"IV\\", in 2005. On 4 October 2006 To/Die/For released their fifth studio album, entitled \\"Wounds Wide Open\\". After the promotional tour that stretched to October 2007, the band decided to take a break. =Samsara / Cult, Deaths, Split-Up & Reformation (2009-2016, 2019-present)= To/Die/For released their 6th album \\"Samsara\\" in 2011, and after spending the following years touring, released their 7th studio album \\"Cult\\" in May 2015. The first single from their album \\"Screaming Birds\\" was released in November 2014. To/Die/For retired in July 2016. Two of the band's former drummers died; Tommi Lillman died on 13 February 2012 after an accident, and Santtu Lonka died on January 26, 2020 with no cause of death revealed (probably suicide). In January 2020, the band announced they would be reuniting to play at the John Smith Fesival at Laukaa, Finland in July 2020.

The melody and lyrics are relatively close to the original, and Lavin's original delivery of the song was reminiscent of Astrud Gilberto's simple, breathy style. The song's context differs from the original in that it is sung in reference to a male character. Though both songs are about unrequited desire for the title character, the humor of \\"The Boy From...\\" stems partly from the fact that the narrator is completely unaware of her crush's blatant homosexuality,Banfield, Stephen. Listing Sondheim's Broadway Musicals, University of Michigan Press, 1995, , p. 28 as, for example, illustrated in the song's second bridge: \\"Why are his trousers vermilion? / Why does he claim he's Castilian? / Why do his friends call him Lillian? / And I hear at the end of the week, / he's leaving to start a boutique.\\" The other humorous aspect of the song comes from the fact that every verse ends with a repetition of the name of the title character's hometown (hence the title), a fictional village called \\"Tacarembo la Tumba del Fuego Santa Malipas Zacatecas la Junta del Sol y Cruz\\" (\\"Cruz\\" pronounced as \\"cruth\\" with distinci√≥n): with the narrator becoming slightly more out-of-breath with each verse.

It is loosely based on Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel. The film stars David Niven as the \\"original\\" Bond, Sir James Bond 007. Forced out of retirement to investigate the deaths and disappearances of international spies, he soon battles the mysterious Dr. Noah and SMERSH. The film's tagline: \\"Casino Royale is too much... for one James Bond!\\" refers to Bond's ruse to mislead SMERSH in which six other agents are pretending to be \\"James Bond\\", namely, baccarat master Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers); millionaire spy Vesper Lynd (Ursula Andress); Bond's secretary Miss Moneypenny (Barbara Bouchet); Bond's daughter by Mata Hari, Mata Bond (Joanna Pettet); and British agents Coop (Terence Cooper) and The Detainer (Daliah Lavi). Charles K. Feldman, the producer, had acquired the film rights in 1960 and had attempted to get Casino Royale made as an Eon Productions Bond film; however, Feldman and the producers of the Eon series, Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, failed to come to terms. Believing that he could not compete with the Eon series, Feldman resolved to produce the film as a satire. The budget escalated as various directors and writers became involved in the production, and actors expressed dissatisfaction with the project. Casino Royale was released on 13 April 1967, two months prior to Eon's fifth Bond movie, You Only Live Twice. The film was a financial success, grossing over $41.7 million worldwide, and Burt Bacharach's musical score was praised, earning him an Oscar nomination for the song \\"The Look of Love\\". Critical reception to Casino Royale, however, was generally negative, with many reviewers regarding it as a baffling, disorganised affair. Since 1999, the film's rights have been held by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, distributors of the official Bond movies by Eon Productions. Plot Sir James Bond 007, a legendary British spy who retired from the secret service 20 years previously, is visited by the head of British MI6, M; CIA representative Ransome; KGB representative Smernov; and Deuxi√®me Bureau representative Le Grand. All implore Bond to come out of retirement to deal with SMERSH, who have been eliminating agents; Bond spurns all their pleas. When Bond continues to stand firm, his mansion is destroyed by a mortar attack at the orders of M (who is, however, killed in the explosion). Bond travels to Scotland to return M's remains to his grieving widow, Lady Fiona McTarry. However, the real Lady Fiona has been replaced by SMERSH's Agent Mimi. The rest of the household have been likewise replaced, with SMERSH's aim to discredit Bond by destroying his \\"celibate image\\". Attempts by a bevy of beauties to seduce Bond fail, but Mimi/Lady Fiona becomes so impressed with Bond that she changes loyalties and helps Bond to foil the plot against him. On his way back to London, Bond survives another attempt on his life. Bond is promoted to the head of MI6. He learns that many British agents around the world have been eliminated by enemy spies because of their inability to resist sex. Bond is also told that the \\"sex maniac\\" who was given the name of \\"James Bond\\" when the original Bond retired has gone to work in television. He then orders that all remaining MI6 agents will be named \\"James Bond 007\\", to confuse SMERSH. He also creates a rigorous programme to train male agents to ignore the charms of women. Moneypenny recruits Coop, a karate expert who begins training to resist seductive women: he also meets an exotic agent known as the Detainer. Bond then hires Vesper Lynd, a retired agent turned millionaire, to recruit baccarat expert Evelyn Tremble, whom he intends to use to beat SMERSH agent Le Chiffre. Having embezzled SMERSH's money, Le Chiffre is desperate for money to cover up his theft before he is executed. Following up a clue from agent Mimi, Bond persuades his estranged daughter Mata Bond to travel to West Berlin to infiltrate International Mothers' Help, an au pair service that is a cover for a SMERSH training center. Mata uncovers a plan to sell compromising photographs of military leaders from the US, USSR, China and Great Britain at an \\"art auction\\", another scheme Le Chiffre hopes to use to raise money. Mata destroys the photos. Le Chiffre's only remaining option is to raise the money by playing baccarat. Tremble arrives at the Casino Royale accompanied by Lynd, who foils an attempt to disable him by seductive SMERSH agent Miss Goodthighs. Later that night, Tremble observes Le Chiffre playing at the casino and realises that he is using infrared sunglasses to cheat. Lynd steals the sunglasses, allowing Evelyn to eventually beat Le Chiffre in a game of baccarat. Lynd is apparently abducted outside the casino, and Tremble is also kidnapped while pursuing her. Le Chiffre, desperate for the winning cheque, hallucinogenically tortures Tremble. Lynd rescues Tremble, only to subsequently kill him. Meanwhile, SMERSH agents raid Le Chiffre's base and kill him. In London, Mata is kidnapped by SMERSH in a giant flying saucer, and Sir James and Moneypenny travel to Casino Royale to rescue her. They discover that the casino is located atop a giant underground headquarters run by the evil Dr. Noah, secretly Sir James's nephew Jimmy Bond, a former MI6 agent who defected to SMERSH to spite his famous uncle. Jimmy reveals that he plans to use biological warfare to make all women beautiful and kill all men over tall, leaving him as the \\"big man\\" who gets all the girls. Jimmy has already captured The Detainer, and he tries to convince her to be his partner; she agrees, but only to dupe him into swallowing one of his atomic time pills, turning him into a walking atomic bomb. Sir James, Moneypenny, Mata and Coop manage to escape from their cell and fight their way back to the casino director's office where Sir James establishes Lynd is a double agent. The casino is then overrun by secret agents and a battle ensues. American and French support arrive, but just add to the chaos. Jimmy counts down a series of hiccups, each bringing him closer to doom. Eventually the atomic pill explodes, destroying Casino Royale with everyone inside. Sir James and all of his agents then appear in heaven, and Jimmy Bond is shown descending to hell.

London Life; London (Dec 17, 1966): 12-14. Stunt director Richard Talmadge employed Geraldine Chaplin to appear in a brief Keystone Cops insert. The film also proved to be young Anjelica Huston's first experience in the film industry as she was called upon by her father, John Huston, to cover the screen shots of Deborah Kerr's hands. The film also marks the debut of Dave Prowse, later the physical form of Darth Vader in the Star Wars series, as Frankenstein's monster, a role he would later play again in the Hammer films The Horror of Frankenstein and Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell. John Le Mesurier features in the early scenes of the film as M's driver. Development In March 1955, Ian Fleming sold the film rights of his novel Casino Royale, the first book featuring the character of James Bond, to the producer Gregory Ratoff for $6,000 ($ in dollars). after Ratoff had bought a six-month option the previous year. Ratoff commissioned Lorenzo Semple Jr., to write a script but both men thought Bond was unbelievable and stupid. According to Semple, Ratoff considered the project needed Bond to be female and wished to cast Susan Hayward as 'Jane' Bond. In 1956, The New York Times reported Ratoff had set up a production company with Michael Garrison to produce a film adaptation, but he was unable to find financial backers before he died in December 1960. The agent/producer Charles K. Feldman had represented Ratoff and bought the film rights for Casino Royale from his widow. Albert R. Broccoli, who had held an interest in adapting James Bond for some years, offered to purchase the Casino Royale rights from Feldman, but he declined. Feldman and his friend, the director Howard Hawks, had an interest in adapting Casino Royale, considering Leigh Brackett as a writer and Cary Grant as James Bond. They eventually decided not to proceed after they saw the film Dr. No (1962), the first Bond adaptation made by Broccoli and his partner Harry Saltzman through their company Eon Productions. By 1964, with Feldman having invested nearly $550,000 of his own money into pre-production of Casino Royale, he decided to try a deal with Eon Productions and United Artists. The attempt at a co-production eventually fell through as Feldman frequently argued with Broccoli and Saltzman, especially regarding the profit divisions and when the Casino Royale adaptation would start production. Feldman approached Sean Connery to play Bond, but rejected Connery's offer to do the film for one million dollars.Sellers, Robert Sean Connery: A Celebration Robert Hale, 1 December 1999, p. 62 Feldman eventually decided to offer his project to Columbia Pictures through a script written by Ben Hecht, and the studio accepted. Given Eon's series led to spy films being in vogue at the time, Feldman opted to make his film a spoof of the Bond series instead of a straightforward adaptation. =Screenplay development= Ben Hecht's contribution to the project, if not the final result, was in fact substantial and he wrote several complete drafts. Time magazine reported in May 1966 that Hecht had \\"three bashes\\" at completing a script, while his papers contain material from four surviving screenplays by Hecht. His treatments were almost entirely \\"straight\\" adaptations, far closer to the original source novel than the spoof which the final production became. A draft from 1957 discovered in Hecht's papers ‚Äì but which does not identify the screenwriter ‚Äì is a direct adaptation of the novel, albeit with the Bond character absent, instead being replaced by a poker-playing American gangster. Later drafts see vice made central to the plot, with the Le Chiffre character becoming head of a network of brothels (as he is in the novel) whose patrons are then blackmailed by Le Chiffre to fund Spectre (an invention of the screenwriter). The racy plot elements opened up by this change of background include a chase scene through Hamburg's red light district that results in Bond escaping disguised as a female mud wrestler. New characters appear such as Lili Wing, a brothel madam and former lover of Bond whose ultimate fate is to be crushed in the back of a garbage truck, and Gita, wife of Le Chiffre. The beautiful Gita, whose face and throat are hideously disfigured as a result of Bond using her as a shield during a gunfight in the same sequence which sees Wing meet her fate, goes on to become the prime protagonist in the torture scene that features in the book, a role originally Le Chiffre's. Virtually nothing from Hecht's scripts was ever filmed, although a draft dated to February 1964 has a line of dialogue containing the idea of MI6 having given multiple agents the name of James Bond after Bond has died to confuse the other side. Hecht died from a heart attack in April 1964, two days after finishing his script and before he was able to present it to Feldman. Joseph Heller (and his friend George Mandel) worked on the project for a few weeks in early 1965 submitting more than 100 pages after Feldman offered Heller $150,000. Heller later wrote about this episode in How I found James Bond, lost my self-respect and almost made $150,000 in my spare time. Time reported in 1966 that the script had been completely re-written by Billy Wilder, and by the time the film reached production only the idea that the name James Bond should be given to a number of other agents remained. This key plot device in the finished film, in the case of Hecht's version, occurs after the demise of the original James Bond (an event which happened prior to the beginning of his story) which, as Hecht's M puts it, \\"not only perpetuates his memory, but confuses the opposition.\\" In addition to the credited writers, Woody Allen, Peter Sellers, Val Guest, Ben Hecht, Joseph Heller, Terry Southern, and Billy Wilder are all believed to have contributed to the screenplay to varying degrees. Feldman called it \\"a four ring circus\\". Peter Sellers hired Terry Southern to write his dialogue (and not the rest of the script) to \\"outshine\\" Orson Welles and Woody Allen.Gerber, Gail & Lisanti, Tom. Trippin' with Terry Southern: What I Think I Remember, McFarland, p. 48. =Cast= Feldman originally intended to cast Terence Cooper as James Bond and had him under personal contract for two years prior to the movie being made.An 0071 Movie Without Connery? Get Headquarters! By STEPHEN WATTS. New York Times 22 May 1966: 129. Feldman had worked with Peter Sellers on What's New Pussycat? and offered the actor a part as James Bond. Sellers originally turned him down saying he felt the image of Bond was \\"too fixed\\". Feldman persuaded Sellers to change his mind by asking the actor to instead play a \\"little man\\" who plays James Bond. Filming Filming started 11 January 1966.Train on a 'Foreign' Track Martin, Betty. Los Angeles Times 1 July 1966: d11. The principal filming was carried out at Pinewood Studios, Shepperton Studios and Twickenham Studios in London. Extensive sequences also featured London, notably Trafalgar Square and the exterior of 10 Downing Street. Mereworth Castle in Kent was used as the home of Sir James Bond, which is blown up at the start of the film. Much of the filming for M's Scottish castle was actually done on location in County Meath, Ireland, with Killeen Castle as the focus. However, the car chase sequences where Bond leaves the castle were shot in the Perthshire village of Killin with further sequences in Berkshire (specifically Old Windsor and Bracknell). Filming was finished by October 1966 at which stage Feldman said the budget was between $8.5 and $9.5 million, of which the cast cost $3 million. Peter Sellers was to receive a percentage of the gross after the takings reached $17.5 million007 TO MULTIPLY IN 'CASINO ROYALE': A Half-Dozen James Bonds Cast in Film by Feldman By VINCENT CANBY. New York Times 5 Oct 1966: 38. =Directors= Five different directors helming different segments of the film and with stunt co-ordinator Richard Talmadge co-directing the final sequence. Feldman said that John Huston contribued 38 minutes in the final cut, Ken Hughes 25 minutes, Joseph McGrath 20 minutes, Robert Parrish 20 minutes, and val Guest 26 minutes. Huston's sequence involved Sir James Bond meeting the representatives of agencies. It was shot in Ireland and Kent in April 1966. Huston worked on his section of the script with Wolf Mankowitz. Huston had written most of Beat the Devil on location but says \\"that was discipline compared to this. It was day to day then it's moment to moment here.\\"London Cameras Grind Exceedingly Los Angeles Times 13 Apr 1966: d7. Huston wanted Robert Morley to play M but when he was not available the director decided to play the role himself.

New York Times 25 Sep 1966: 121 Joseph McGrath shot for six weeks. Bob Parrish filmed the segment with Ursula Andress and Peter Sellers at Shepperton. Val Guest wrote and directed the last section and was given the responsibility of splicing the various \\"chapters\\" together. Feldman says Parrish was to provide \\"suspense\\" while McGrath did \\"Sellers like comedy\\". He was offered the unique title of co-ordinating director but declined, claiming the chaotic plot would not reflect well on him if he were so credited. His extra credit was labelled 'additional sequences' instead.Guest, Val. So you want to be in Pictures, Reynolds & Hearn, 2001, Director credits: =Peter Sellers= Part of the behind-the-scenes drama of this film's production concerned the filming of the segments involving Peter Sellers. Screenwriter Wolf Mankowitz declared that Sellers felt intimidated by Orson Welles to the extent that, except for a couple of shots, neither was in the studio simultaneously. Other versions of the legend depict the drama stemming from Sellers being slighted, in favour of Welles, by Princess Margaret (whom Sellers knew) during her visit to the set. Welles also insisted on performing magic tricks as Le Chiffre, and the director obliged. Director Val Guest wrote that Welles did not think much of Sellers, and had refused to work with \\"that amateur\\". Director Joseph McGrath, a personal friend of Sellers, was punched by the actor when he complained about Sellers's behaviour on the set.Sikov, Ed. Mr Strangelove: A Biography of Peter Sellers. Pan Macmillan, 2011. . pp. 310‚Äì3 Some biographies of Sellers suggest that he took the role of Bond to heart, and was annoyed at the decision to make Casino Royale a comedy, as he wanted to play Bond straight. This is illustrated in somewhat fictionalised form in the film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, based on the biography by Roger Lewis, who has claimed that Sellers kept re- writing and improvising scenes to make them play seriously. This story is in agreement with the observation that the only parts of the film close to the book are the ones featuring Sellers and Welles.Lewis, Roger. The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, Applause Books, 2000, In the end, Sellers's involvement with the film was cut abruptly short. =Cast= Jean-Paul Belmondo and George Raft received major billing, even though each actor appears only briefly. Both appear during the climactic brawl at the end, Raft flipping his trademark coin and promptly shooting himself dead with a backward-firing pistol, while Belmondo appears wearing a fake moustache as the French Foreign Legion officer who requires an English phrase book to translate \\"merde!\\" into \\"ooch!\\" during his fistfight. Raft's coin flip, which originally appeared in Scarface (1932), had been spoofed a few years earlier in Some Like It Hot (1959). At the Intercon science fiction convention held in Slough in 1978, David Prowse commented on his part in this film, apparently his big- screen debut. He claimed that he was originally asked to play \\"Super Pooh\\", a giant Winnie-the-Pooh in a superhero costume who attacks Tremble during the Torture of The Mind sequence. This idea, as with many others in the film's script, was rapidly dropped, and Prowse was re-cast as a Frankenstein-type monster for the closing scenes. The final sequence was principally directed by former actor and stuntman Richard Talmadge. =Unfinished scenes= Sellers went absent for days or weeks at a time, refused to appear in his scenes with Welles and left the production before all of his scenes had been shot. As a result, Sellers was unavailable for the filming of an ending and other interlinking scenes, leaving the filmmakers to devise a way to make the existing footage work without him. The framing device of a beginning and ending with David Niven was created to salvage the material. Val Guest, who had been given the task of creating a narrative thread which would link all segments of the film, chose to use the original Bond and Vesper Lynd as linking characters. Signs of missing footage from the Sellers segments are evident at various points. Evelyn Tremble is not captured on camera; an outtake of Sellers entering a racing car was substituted. In this outtake, he calls for the car, √† la The Pink Panther, to chase down Vesper and her kidnappers; the next thing that is shown is Tremble being tortured. Out-takes of Sellers were also used for Tremble's dream sequence (pretending to play the piano on Ursula Andress' torso), in the finale ‚Äì blowing out the candles while in highland dress ‚Äì and at the end of the film when all the various \\"James Bond doubles\\" are together. In the kidnap sequence, Tremble's death is also very abruptly inserted; it consists of pre-existing footage of Tremble being rescued by Vesper, followed by a later-filmed shot of her abruptly deciding to shoot him, followed by a freeze-frame over some of the previous footage of her surrounded by bodies (noticeably a zoom-in on the previous shot). As well as this, an entire sequence involving Tremble going to the front for the underground James Bond training school (which turns out to be under Harrods, of which the training area was the lowest level) was never shot, thus creating an abrupt cut from Vesper announcing that Tremble will be James Bond to Tremble exiting the lift into the training school. Many sequences from the film were dropped, so that several actors never appeared in the final cut, including Ian Hendry (as 006, the agent whose body is briefly seen being disposed of by Vesper), Mona Washbourne and Arthur Mullard. Music For the music, Feldman decided to bring in Burt Bacharach, who had done the score for his previous production What's New Pussycat?. Bacharach worked over two years writing for Casino Royale, in the meantime composing the After the Fox score and being forced to decline participation in Luv. Lyricist Hal David contributed with various songs, many of which appeared in just instrumental versions. Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass performed some of the songs with Mike Redway singing the lyrics to the title song as the end credits rolled. The title theme was Alpert's second number one on the Easy Listening chart where it spent two weeks at the top in June 1967 and peaked at number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100. Alpert would later contribute a trumpet solo to the title song of the \\"unofficial\\" 1983 James Bond film Never Say Never Again (which was sung by Alpert's wife, Lani Hall). The film features the song \\"The Look of Love\\" performed by Dusty Springfield. It is played in the scene of Vesper Lynd recruiting Evelyn Tremble, seen through a man-size aquarium in a seductive walk. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. The song was a Top 10 radio hit at the KGB and KHJ radio stations. It was heard again in the first Austin Powers film, which was to a degree inspired by Casino Royale. For the European release, Mireille Mathieu sang versions of \\"The Look of Love\\" in both French (\\"Les Yeux D'Amour\\"), and German (\\"Ein Blick von Dir\\"). Bacharach would later rework two tracks of the score into songs: \\"Home James, Don't Spare the Horses\\" was re-arranged as \\"Bond Street\\", appearing on Bacharach's album Reach Out (1967), and \\"Flying Saucer ‚Äì First Stop Berlin\\", was reworked with vocals as \\"Let the Love Come Through\\" by orchestra leader and arranger Roland Shaw. A clarinet melody would later be featured in a Cracker Jack peanut popcorn commercial. As an in-joke, a brief snippet of John Barry's song \\"Born Free\\" is used in the film. At the time, Barry was the main composer for the Eon Bond series, and said song had won an Academy Award over Bacharach's own \\"Alfie\\".Burt Bacharach, Song by Song: The Ultimate Burt Bacharach Reference for Fans The cover art was done by Robert McGinnis, based on the film poster.

It then became a standard \\"audiophile test\\" record for decades to come, especially the vocal performance by Dusty Springfield on \\"The Look of Love.\\" The film soundtrack has since been released by other companies in different configurations (including complete score releases). The highly regarded master tapes were damaged, however, during a 1990s remastering so none of the subsequent re-releases is considered to be as fine as the original LP release. Budget The studio approved the film's production budget of $6 million, already quite large in 1966. However, during filming the project ran into several problems and the shoot ran months over schedule, with the costs also running well over. When the film was finally completed it had doubled its original budget to $12 million, making it one of the most expensive films that had been made to that point. The previous Eon Bond film, Thunderball (1965), had a budget of $5.5 million while the nearly contemporary You Only Live Twice (1967), had a budget of $9.5 million. The extremely high budget of Casino Royale led to comparisons with a troubled production from 1963, and it was referred to as \\"a runaway mini-Cleopatra\\". Columbia at first announced the film was due to be released in time for Christmas 1966. The problems postponed the launch until April 1967. Release and reception Casino Royale had its world premiere in London's Odeon Leicester Square on 13 April 1967, breaking many opening records in the theatre's history. Its American premiere was held in New York on 28 April, at the Capitol and Cinema I theatres. It opened two months prior to the fifth Bond film by Eon Productions, You Only Live Twice. =Box office and marketing= Despite the lukewarm nature of the contemporary reviews, the pull of the James Bond name was sufficient to make it the 13th highest-grossing film in North America in 1967 with a gross of $22.7 million ($ million in dollars) and a worldwide total of $41.7 million ($ million in dollars). Orson Welles attributed the success of the film to a marketing strategy that featured a naked tattooed woman on the film's posters and print ads. The campaign also included a series of commercials featuring British model Twiggy. As late as 2011, the film was still making money for the estate of Peter Sellers, who negotiated an extraordinary 3% of the gross profits (an estimated ¬£120 million), with the proceeds currently going to Cassie Unger, the daughter and sole heir of Sellers's beneficiary, fourth wife Lynne Frederick. When domestic box-office receipts are adjusted for inflation, Casino Royale is 20th-largest grossing of all the Bond films. =Critical reception= No advance press screenings of Casino Royale were held, leading reviews to only appear after the premiere. The chaotic nature of the production features heavily in contemporary and later reviews. Roger Ebert said \\"This is possibly the most indulgent film ever made\\", Time described Casino Royale as \\"an incoherent and vulgar vaudeville\\", and Variety declared the film to be \\"a conglomeration of frenzied situations, ‚Äòin‚Äô gags and special effects, lacking discipline and cohesion.\\". Bosley Crowther of The New York Times had some positive statements about the film, considering Casino Royale had \\"more of the talent agent than the secret agent\\" and praising the \\"fast start\\" and the scenes up to the baccarat game between Bond and Le Chiffre. Afterward, Crowther felt, the script became tiresome, repetitive and filled with clich√©s due to \\"wild and haphazard injections of 'in' jokes and outlandish gags\\", leading to an excessive length that made the film a \\"reckless, disconnected nonsense that could be telescoped or stopped at any point\\". Writing in 1986, Danny Peary noted, \\"It's hard to believe that in 1967 we actually waited in anticipation for this so-called James Bond spoof. It was a disappointment then; it's a curio today, but just as hard to get through.\\" Peary described the film as being \\"disjointed and stylistically erratic\\" and \\"a testament to wastefulness in the bigger-is-better cinema,\\" before adding, \\"It would have been a good idea to cut the picture drastically, perhaps down to the scenes featuring Peter Sellers and Woody Allen. In fact, I recommend you see it on television when it's in a two-hour (including commercials) slot. Then you won't expect it to make any sense.\\" A few recent reviewers have been more impressed by the film. Andrea LeVasseur, in the AllMovie review, called it \\"the original ultimate spy spoof\\", and opined that the \\"nearly impossible to follow\\" plot made it \\"a satire to the highest degree\\". Further describing it as a \\"hideous, zany disaster\\" LeVasseur concluded that it was \\"a psychedelic, absurd masterpiece\\". Cinema historian Robert von Dassanowsky has written about the artistic merits of the film and says \\"like Casablanca, Casino Royale is a film of momentary vision, collaboration, adaption, pastiche, and accident. It is the anti-auteur work of all time, a film shaped by the very zeitgeist it took on.\\" Romano Tozzi complimented the acting and humour, although he also mentioned that the film has several dull stretches.. In his review of the film, Leonard Maltin remarked, \\"Money, money everywhere, but [the] film is terribly uneven ‚Äì sometimes funny, often not.\\" Simon Winder called Casino Royale \\"a pitiful spoof\\", while Robert Druce described it as \\"an abstraction of real life\\". The film holds a 25% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 40 reviews with an average rating of 4.48/10. The website's critical consensus states: \\"A goofy, dated parody of spy movie cliches, Casino Royale squanders its all-star cast on a meandering, mostly laugh-free script.\\" =Awards= \\"The Look of Love\\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, losing to \\"Talk to the Animals\\" from Doctor Dolittle. Burt Bacharach's score also earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or Television Show, won by Mission: Impossible. Julie Harris was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design. =Home media and film rights= Columbia Pictures released Casino Royale on VHS in 1989, and on Laserdisc in 1994. In 1999, following the Columbia/MGM/Kevin McClory lawsuit on ownership of the Bond film series, the rights to the film were transferred to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (whose sister company United Artists co-owns the Bond film franchise) as a condition of the settlement. MGM then issued the first DVD release of Casino Royale in 2002, followed by a 40th anniversary special edition in 2007. Years later, as a result of the Sony/Comcast acquisition of MGM, Columbia would once again become responsible for the co-distribution of this film as well as the entire Eon Bond series, including the 2006 adaptation of Casino Royale. However, MGM Home Entertainment changed its distributor to 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in May 2006. Fox has since been responsible for the debut of the 1967 Casino Royale on Blu-ray disc in 2011. Danjaq LLC, Eon's holding company, is shown as one of its present copyright owners.. Alongside six other MGM- owned films, the studio posted Casino Royale on YouTube.

With over of retail space and more than 380,000 articles available, it is the second largest department store in Europe after Harrods in London. It attracts 40,000 to 50,000 visitors every day. The store is located on Tauentzienstra√üe, a major shopping street, between Wittenbergplatz and Breitscheidplatz, near the heart of former West Berlin, and is technically in the extreme northwest of the south Berlin neighborhood of Sch√∂neberg.

It opened on 27 March 1907 with an area of 24,000 sq m.KaDeWe , City of Berlin In June 1927, ownership changed to the Hermann Tietz, who was responsible for modernizing and expanding the store. They had the ambition to add two new floors but because of the Nazi rise to power in the 1930s their plans came to a sudden halt. Hermann Tietz was a Jewish owned partnership and because of the Nazis' race laws the company was aryanized by duress and its name changed to Hertie. During World War II, Allied bombing ruined most of the store, with one shot-down American bomber actually crashing into it in 1943. Most of the store was gutted, which caused its closure. The re-opening of the first two floors was celebrated in 1950. Full reconstruction of all seven floors was finished by 1956. \\"KaDeWe\\" soon became a symbol of the regained economic power of West Germany during the Wirtschaftswunder economic boom, as well as emblematic of the material prosperity of West Berlin versus that of the East. Between 1976 and 1978, the store's floor space was expanded from 24,000 sq m to 44,000 sq m. Just after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, KaDeWe recorded a record-breaking number of people going through the store. By 1996, with a further floor and restaurant added, the sales area had expanded to 60,000 sq m. In 1994, the KarstadtQuelle AG corporation acquired Hertie and with it KaDeWe. Most of the floors were renovated between 2004 and 2007 in preparation for the store's one hundredth anniversary. In January 2014, a majority stake in Karstadt Premium GmbH was acquired by the Signa Holding GmbH. , KaDeWe Berlin company Web site In 2015, it was acquired by the Central Group. Features The food hall on the sixth floor Winter garden - restaurant at top floor KaDeWe has eight floors, each focused on a different type of merchandise. The ground floor is all beauty accessories and luxury goods. The services offered include beauty salons as well as nail and foot spas. The so-called \\"Luxury Boulevard\\" is also situated here, with various luxury brands. The 1st floor is men's apparel. The 2nd floor is devoted to women's fashion. The 3rd floor is referred to as \\"the Loft\\" and is Germany's biggest luxury shoe department. Women's leather goods and lingerie are sold here, too. The 4th floor contains interior and design items, as well as the in-house wedding and gift registry services. The 5th floor is arts, books, entertainment, electronics, toys, office supplies, and souvenirs. The 6th and 7th floors are entirely devoted to food, and advertisements tout the place as having two football fields of food. The 6th floor food hall is called \\"Delicatessen\\" and is famous for its wide variety of food and beverages. It has around 110 cooks and 40 bakers and confectioners supplying more than 30 gourmet counters. The top floor (added in the early 1990s) includes a winter garden with a 1000-seat restaurant surrounded by an all-windowed wall offering a view over the Wittenbergplatz.

VMP was developed as a means of generalizing the approximate variational methods used by such techniques as Latent Dirichlet allocation and works by updating an approximate distribution at each node through messages in the node's Markov blanket. Likelihood Lower Bound Given some set of hidden variables H and observed variables V, the goal of approximate inference is to lower-bound the probability that a graphical model is in the configuration V. Over some probability distribution Q (to be defined later), : \\\\ln P(V) = \\\\sum_H Q(H) \\\\ln \\\\frac{P(H,V)}{P(HV)} = \\\\sum_{H} Q(H) \\\\Bigg[ \\\\ln \\\\frac{P(H,V)}{Q(H)} - \\\\ln \\\\frac{P(HV)}{Q(H)} \\\\Bigg] . So, if we define our lower bound to be : L(Q) = \\\\sum_{H} Q(H) \\\\ln \\\\frac{P(H,V)}{Q(H)} , then the likelihood is simply this bound plus the relative entropy between P and Q. Because the relative entropy is non-negative, the function L defined above is indeed a lower bound of the log likelihood of our observation V. The distribution Q will have a simpler character than that of P because marginalizing over P is intractable for all but the simplest of graphical models. In particular, VMP uses a factorized distribution Q: : Q(H) = \\\\prod_i Q_i(H_i), where H_i is a disjoint part of the graphical model. Determining the Update Rule The likelihood estimate needs to be as large as possible; because it's a lower bound, getting closer \\\\log P improves the approximation of the log likelihood. By substituting in the factorized version of Q, L(Q), parameterized over the hidden nodes H_i as above, is simply the negative relative entropy between Q_j and Q_j^* plus other terms independent of Q_j if Q_j^* is defined as :Q_j^*(H_j) = \\\\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\\\mathbb{E}_{-j}\\\\\\\\{\\\\ln P(H,V)\\\\\\\\}} , where \\\\mathbb{E}_{-j}\\\\\\\\{\\\\ln P(H,V)\\\\\\\\} is the expectation over all distributions Q_i except Q_j. Thus, if we set Q_j to be Q_j^*, the bound L is maximized. Messages in Variational Message Passing Parents send their children the expectation of their sufficient statistic while children send their parents their natural parameter, which also requires messages to be sent from the co-parents of the node. Relationship to Exponential Families Because all nodes in VMP come from exponential families and all parents of nodes are conjugate to their children nodes, the expectation of the sufficient statistic can be computed from the normalization factor. VMP Algorithm The algorithm begins by computing the expected value of the sufficient statistics for that vector. Then, until the likelihood converges to a stable value (this is usually accomplished by setting a small threshold value and running the algorithm until it increases by less than that threshold value), do the following at each node: #Get all messages from parents #Get all messages from children (this might require the children to get messages from the co-parents) #Compute the expected value of the nodes sufficient statistics Constraints Because every child must be conjugate to its parent, this limits the types of distributions that can be used in the model. For example, the parents of a Gaussian distribution must be a Gaussian distribution (corresponding to the Mean) and a gamma distribution (corresponding to the precision, or one over \\\\sigma in more common parameterizations). Discrete variables can have Dirichlet parents, and Poisson and exponential nodes must have gamma parents. However, if the data can be modeled in this manner, VMP offers a generalized framework for providing inference.

The goal is to discover the identity and properties of the particles that make up the universe and to understand the forces and interactions between those particles. CDF is an international collaboration of about 600 physicists (from about 30 American universities and National laboratories and about 30 groups from universities and national laboratories from Italy, Japan, UK, Canada, Germany, Spain, Russia, Finland, France, Taiwan, Korea, and Switzerland). The CDF detector itself weighed 5000 tons and was about 12 meters in all three dimensions. The goal of the experiment is to measure exceptional events out of the billions of particle collisions in order to: * Look for evidence for phenomena beyond the Standard Model of particle physics * Measure and study the production and decay of heavy particles such as the Top and Bottom Quarks, and the W and Z bosons * Measure and study the production of high-energy particle jets and photons * Study other phenomena such as diffraction The Tevatron collided protons and antiprotons at a center- of-mass energy of about 2 TeV. The very high energy available for these collisions made it possible to produce heavy particles such as the Top quark and the W and Z bosons, which weigh much more than a proton (or antiproton). These heavier particles were identified through their characteristic decays. The CDF apparatus recorded the trajectories and energies of electrons, photons and light hadrons. Neutrinos did not register in the apparatus which led to an apparent missing energy. Other hypothetical particles might leave a missing energy signature, and some searches for new phenomena are based on that. There is another experiment similar to CDF called D0 which had a detector located at another point on the Tevatron ring.  History of CDF  There were two particle detectors located on the Tevatron at Fermilab: CDF and D√ò. CDF predated D√ò as the first detector on the Tevatron. Construction of CDF began in 1982 under the leadership of John Peoples. The Tevatron was completed in 1983 and CDF began to take data in 1985.Jean, Reising. \\"History and Archives Project.\\" About Fermilab - History and Archives Project - Main Page. 2006. Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. 10 May 2009 http://history.fnal.gov/ Over the years, two major updates were made to CDF. The first upgrade began in 1989 and the second began in 2001. Each upgrade was considered a \\"run\\". Run 0 was the run before any upgrades, Run I was after the first upgrade and Run II was after the second upgrade. Run II includes upgrades on the central tracking system, preshower detectors and extension on muon coverage.\\"Brief Description of the CDF Detector in Run II.\\" (2004): 1-2. =After 2004= The Tevatron was shut down in 2011.

Collider Detector at Fermilab. 28 Apr. 2009 . The existence of the top quark was hypothesized after the observation of the Upsilon at Fermilab in 1977, which was found to consist of a bottom quark and an anti-bottom quark. The Standard Model, which today is the most widely accepted theory describing the particles and interactions, predicted the existence of three generations of quarks. The first generation quarks are the up and down quarks, second generation quarks are strange and charm, and third generation are top and bottom. The existence of the bottom quark solidified physicists‚Äô conviction that the top quark existed.Lankford, Andy. \\"Discovery of the Top Quark.\\" Collider Detector at Fermilab. 25 Apr. 2009 . The top quark was the very last quark to be observed, mostly due to its comparatively high mass. Whereas the masses of the other quarks range from .005 GeV (up quark) to 4.7GeV (bottom quark), the top quark has a mass of 175 GeV.\\"Quark Chart.\\" The Particle Adventure. Particle Data Group. 5 May 2009 . Only Fermilab‚Äôs Tevatron had the energy capability to produce and detect top anti-top pairs. The large mass of the top quark caused the top quark to decay almost instantaneously, within the order of 10‚àí25 seconds, making it extremely difficult to observe. The Standard Model predicts that the top quark may decay leptonically into a bottom quark and a W boson. This W boson may then decay into a lepton and neutrino (t‚ÜíWb‚Üí—µlb). Therefore, CDF worked to reconstruct top events, looking specifically for evidence of bottom quarks, W bosons neutrinos. Finally in February 1995, CDF had enough evidence to say that they had \\"discovered\\" the top quark.Quigg, Chris. \\"Discovery of the Top Quark.\\" 1996. Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. 8 May 2009 .  How CDF works  In order for physicists to understand the data corresponding to each event, they must understand the components of the CDF detector and how the detector works. Each component affects what the data will look like. Today, the 5000-ton detector sits in B0 and analyzes millions of beam collisions per second.Yoh, John (2005). Brief Introduction to the CDF Experiment. Retrieved April 28, 2008, Web site: http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/events/cdfintro.html The detector is designed in many different layers. Each of these layers work simultaneously with the other components of the detector in an effort to interact with the different particles, thereby giving physicists the opportunity to \\"see\\" and study the individual particles. CDF can be divided into layers as follows: * Layer 1: Beam Pipe * Layer 2: Silicon Detector * Layer 3: Central Outer Tracker * Layer 4: Solenoid Magnet * Layer 5: Electromagnetic Calorimeters * Layer 6: Hadronic Calorimeters * Layer 7: Muon Detectors = Layer 1: the beam pipe = The beam pipe is the innermost layer of CDF. The beam pipe is where the protons and anti-protons, traveling at approximately 0.99996 c, collide head on. Each of the protons is moving extremely close to the speed of light with extremely high energies. In a collision, much of the energy is converted into mass. This allows proton/anti- proton annihilation to produce daughter particles, such as top quarks with a mass of 175 GeV, much heavier than the original protons.Lee, Jenny (2008). The Collider Detector at Fermilab. Retrieved September 26, 2008, from CDF Virtual Tour Web site: http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/ = Layer 2: silicon detector = CDF silicon vertex detector Cross section of the silicon detector Surrounding the beam pipe is the silicon detector. This detector is used to track the path of charged particles as they travel through the detector. The silicon detector begins at a radius of r = 1.5 cm from the beam line and extends to a radius of r = 28 cm from the beam line. The silicon detector is composed of seven layers of silicon arranged in a barrel shape around the beam pipe. Silicon is often used in charged particle detectors because of its high sensitivity, allowing for high-resolution vertex and tracking.\\"Particle Detectors.\\" Particle Data Group. 24 July 2008. Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. 11 May 2009 . The first layer of silicon, known as Layer 00, is a single sided detector designed to separate signal from background even under extreme radiation. The remaining layers are double sided and radiation-hard, meaning that the layers are protected from damage from radioactivity. The silicon works to track the paths of charged particles as they pass through the detector by ionizing the silicon. The density of the silicon, coupled with the low ionization energy of silicon, allow ionization signals to travel quickly. As a particle travels through the silicon, its position will be recorded in 3 dimensions. The silicon detector has a track hit resolution of 10 Œºm, and impact parameter resolution of 30 Œºm. Physicists can look at this trail of ions and determine the path that the particle took. As the silicon detector is located within a magnetic field, the curvature of the path through the silicon allows physicists to calculate the momentum of the particle. More curvature means less momentum and vice versa. = Layer 3: central outer tracker (COT) = Outside of the silicon detector, the central outer tracker works in much the manner as the silicon detector as it is also used to track the paths of charged particles and is also located within a magnetic field. The COT, however, is not made of silicon. Silicon is tremendously expensive and is not practical to purchase in extreme quantities. COT is a gas chamber filled with tens of thousands of gold wires arranged in layers and argon gas. Two types of wires are used in the COT: sense wires and field wires. Sense wires are thinner and attract the electrons that are released by the argon gas as it is ionized. The field wires are thicker than the sense wires and attract the positive ions formed from the release of electrons. There are 96 layers of wire and each wire is placed approximately 3.86 mm apart from one another. As in the silicon detector, when a charged particle passes through the chamber it ionizes the gas. This signal is then carried to a nearby wire, which is then carried to the computers for read-out. The COT is approximately 3.1 m long and extends from r = 40 cm to r = 137 cm. Although the COT is not nearly as precise as the silicon detector, the COT has a hit position resolution of 140 Œºm and a momentum resolution of 0.0015 (GeV/c)‚àí1. = Layer 4: solenoid magnet = The solenoid magnet surrounds both the COT and the silicon detector. The purpose of the solenoid is to bend the trajectory of charged particles in the COT and silicon detector by creating a magnetic field parallel to the beam. The solenoid has a radius of r=1.5 m and is 4.8 m in length. The curvature of the trajectory of the particles in the magnet field allows physicists to calculate the momentum of each of the particles. The higher the curvature, the lower the momentum and vice versa. Because the particles have such a high energy, a very strong magnet is needed to bend the paths of the particles. The solenoid is a superconducting magnet cooled by liquid helium. The helium lowers the temperature of the magnet to 4.7 K or -268.45 ¬∞C which reduces the resistance to almost zero, allowing the magnet to conduct high currents with minimal heating and very high efficiency, and creating a powerful magnetic field. = Layers 5 and 6: electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters = Calorimeters quantify the total energy of the particles by converting the energy of particles to visible light though polystyrene scintillators. CDF uses two types of calorimeters: electromagnetic calorimeters and hadronic calorimeters. The electromagnetic calorimeter measures the energy of light particles and the hadronic calorimeter measures the energy of hadrons. The central electromagnetic calorimeter uses alternating sheets of lead and scintillator. Each layer of lead is approximately wide. The lead is used to stop the particles as they pass through the calorimeter and the scintillator is used to quantify the energy of the particles. The hadronic calorimeter works in much the same way except the hadronic calorimeter uses steel in place of lead. Each calorimeter forms a wedge, which consists of both an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. These wedges are about in length and are arranged around the solenoid. = Layer 7: muon detectors = The final \\"layer\\" of the detector consists of the muon detectors. Muons are charged particles that may be produced when heavy particles decay. These high-energy particles hardly interact so the muon detectors are strategically placed at the farthest layer from the beam pipe behind large walls of steel. The steel ensures that only extremely high-energy particles, such as neutrinos and muons, pass through to the muon chambers. There are two aspects of the muon detectors: the planar drift chambers and scintillators. There are four layers of planar drift chambers, each with the capability of detecting muons with a transverse momentum pT > 1.4 GeV/c. These drift chambers work in the same way as the COT. They are filled with gas and wire. The charged muons ionize the gas and the signal is carried to readout by the wires.  Conclusion  Understanding the different components of the detector is important because the detector determines what data will look like and what signal one can expect to see for each of your particles. It is important to remember that a detector is basically a set of obstacles used to force particles to interact, allowing physicists to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the presence of a certain particle. If a charged quark is passing through the detector, the evidence of this quark will be a curved trajectory in the silicon detector and COT deposited energy in the calorimeter. If a neutral particle, such as a neutron, passes through the detector, there will be no track in the COT and silicon detector but deposited energy in the hadronic calorimeter. Muons may appear in the COT and silicon detector and as deposited energy in the muon detectors. Likewise, a neutrino, which rarely if ever interacts, will express itself only in the form of missing energy.

Life Fitch was the second son of Thomas Fitch, of a Colchester family. He was born in Southwark, London. The eldest son, Thomas Hodges (1822‚Äì1907), became a Roman Catholic and eventually was attached to the Marist Church, Notre Dame de France, in Leicester Square, London. The third son, William John (1826‚Äì1902), was headmaster of the Boys' British School, Hitchin, from 1854 till 1899. From a private school Joshua passed to the Borough Road school, Southwark, where he became a pupil teacher in 1838 and a full assistant in 1842. About two years later he was appointed head-master of the Kingsland Road school, Dalston. Studying hard in his spare hours, he in 1850 graduated B.A. in the University of London, and in 1852 proceeded M.A. (in classics). In 1852, after trial work there in the previous year, he joined the staff of the Borough Road Training College, soon after became vice- principal, and in 1856 succeeded to the principalship on the retirement of Dr. James Cornwell. He proved himself a brilliant teacher, especially stimulating his pupils by his lectures on 'Method' and by his enthusiasm for literature. Through life, he laid stress on the importance to the teacher of literary training. After contributing to some of Cornwell's educational treatises, he entered in 1861 into the political arena with Public Education : Why is a New Code needed ? In 1862, he helped in the organisation of the education section of the International Exhibition, and in 1803 Lord Granville, lord president of the council, who on a visit to Borough Road was impressed by Fitch's power as a teacher, made him an inspector of schools. The district assigned to Fitch was the county of York, with the exception of certain portions of the north and the west. His three reports on the Yorkshire district admirably describe its educational condition then. From 1865 to 1867, as assistant commissioner for the schools inquiry commission, he inspected the endowed and proprietary schools in the West Riding of Yorkshire and in the city and ainsty of York, as well as other endowed schools in the North and East Ridings of Yorkshire and in Durham, and his reports were most thorough and suggestive. In 1869, he acted as special commissioner on elementary education in the groat towns (Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, and Leeds), and from 1870 to 1877 was an assistant commissioner of endowed schools. From 1877 to 1883, Fitch performed ordinary official duties as inspector of East Lambeth. In 1883, he became chief inspector of schools for the eastern division, including all the eastern counties from Lincoln to Essex. From 1885 to 1889, he was inspector of elementary training colleges for women in England and Wales. He was continued in this post till 1894, five years beyond the normal age of retirement from government service. Occasionally detached for special duties in the later period of his public service, he prepared in 1888, after a visit to America, a report on American education under the title Notes on American Schools and Training Colleges ; in 1891 a memorandum on the Free School System in the United States, Canada, France, and Belgium ; and in 1893 Instructions to H.M. Inspectors, with Appendices on Thrift and Training of Pupil Teachers. Fitch's educational activities passed far beyond his official work. His association with the University of London was always close. From 1860 to 1865 and from 1869 to 1874, he was examiner in English language and history. In 1875, he was appointed to the senate, and on his retirement in 1900 was made a life fellow. Much of his energy was always devoted to the improvement of the education of women. He was an original member of the North of England Council for the Higher Education of Women (founded in 1866) and one of those who helped to found in 1867 the College for Women at Hitchin, which in 1874 became Girton College, Cambridge. He took an active part in the establishment of the Girls' Public Day School Company in 1874, and was foremost among those who secured, in 1878, the new charter for the University of London which placed women students on equal terms with men. In 1890, he with Anthony John Mundella and Anna Swanwick selected the women's colleges and schools among which was distributed the sum of ¬£60,000 left by Mrs. Emily Pfeiffer for the promotion of women's education. He was consulted by Thomas Holloway about the constitution of Holloway College, Egham, and by the founders of the Maria Grey Training College and the Cambridge Training College for the training of women teachers for secondary schools. In both 1877 and 1878, Fitch lectured with great success on practical teaching at the College of Preceptors, where he was examiner in the theory and practice of education (1879‚Äì81) and moderator in the same subjects (1881‚Äì1903). In 1879‚Äì80 he lectured at Cambridge for the newly appointed teachers' training syndicates and he published his course in 1881 as Lectures on Teaching (new edit. 1882). The book estabhshed Fitch's position in England and America as an expert on school management, organisation, and method. In 1897, he published Thomas and Matthew Arnold and their Influence on English Education in the Great Educators series, and in 1900 he collected his chief lectures and addresses in Educational Aims and Methods. Written with unusual charm of style, these volumes emphasised Fitch's position as that of a pioneer, especially on the practical side of education, as an earnest advocate for the better training of the elementary teacher, and for the more systematic training of secondary teachers. The National Home Reading Union established by Dr. John Brown Paton and Dr. Hill, Master of Downing College, owed much to Fitch's account of The Chautauqua Reading Circles, which he contributed to the Nineteenth Century after his return from America in 1888. After his retirement from the board of education in 1894, he was still active in public work. In 1895, he was a member of departmental committees of the board of education on industrial and naval and dockyard schools. In 1898-9, he was chairman of the council of the Charity Organisation Society. In 1902, he helped in the organisation of a nature study exhibition in London. Fitch, who was made hon. LL.D. of St. Andrews in 1888, and a chevalier of the legion of honour in 1889 by the French government in recognition of the services he rendered in England to French travelling scholars, was knighted in the 1896 Birthday Honours. He died at his residence, 13 Leinster Square, Bayswater, London, on 14 July 1903, and was buried at Kensal Green. Family In 1856, Fitch married Emma, daughter of Joseph Barber Wilks, of the East India Company. She survived him without issue, and in 1904 received a civil list pension of ¬£100 ; she died on 1 April 1909. Works * Public Education: Why is a New Code needed?

He was ruling prince of Anhalt and, from 1603, ruling prince of the revived principality of Anhalt-Bernburg. From 1595 he was governor of Upper Palatinate, and soon became the advisor-in-chief of Frederick IV, Elector Palatine. Life Christian was the second son of Joachim Ernest, Prince of Anhalt, by his first wife Agnes, daughter of Wolfgang I, Count of Barby- M√ºhlingen. Born in Bernburg, Christian was trained from 1570 in Dessau by Caspar Gottschalk in Latin, Italian, and French. Still a child, he participated in diplomatic missions, among other places, to Constantinople; thus prepared, he developed into an ambitious, urbane diplomat. In the early months of 1586 he went to Dresden and remained there several years as the closest friend of his namesake, Christian I, Elector of Saxony, whose Calvinist sympathies he shared. It is known that he suffered from alcoholic excesses during his stay at the electoral court. Taking possession of his family lands in December of the same year (1586), Christian remained a devoted Calvinist and later served as advisor to Frederick IV, Elector Palatine. In 1591 he led the Palatine army in aid of the French king Henry IV. When a dispute for the possession of the bishopric of Strasbourg‚Äîthe so-called Bishops' War‚Äîerupted in 1592, he supported Brandenburg against Lorraine. In 1595 he was appointed Governor of the Upper Palatinate by Frederick IV and settled in Amberg. In 1603 the principality of Anhalt was formally divided between Christian and his surviving brothers. He received Bernburg, and with this settlement revived the old principality of the same name that had been extinct since 1468. As a diplomat, Christian played an important role in the formation of the Protestant Union in 1608. With the death of the Elector Frederick IV, Christian served his son, Frederick V, and was appointed to command the Protestant forces to defend Bohemia against Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II and his allies when that country's nobles elected Frederick as their king in 1619. The same year, Christian was accepted in the Fruitbearing Society. When Bohemian forces were defeated at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, Christian advised Frederick against making a stand in Prague. In 1621, in response to his affiliation with the Palatines, Christian was put under an imperial ban that effectively made him an outlaw within the Holy Roman Empire and stripped him of his lands. Christian fled first to Sweden, and then became a guest of King Christian IV in Denmark. He appealed to Emperor Ferdinand for mercy in 1624 and was allowed to return to his principality, where he died six years later. Marriage and issue In Lorbach on 2 July 1595 Christian married Anna of Bentheim-Tecklenburg (b. Bentheim, 4 January 1579 ‚Äì d. Bernburg, 9 December 1624), daughter of Arnold III, Count of Bentheim- Steinfurt-Tecklenburg-Limburg. They had sixteen children: #Frederick Christian (b. and d.

It is a remarkably well preserved broch - on the east side parts of the old wall still reach to 9 metres tall.  History  Most brochs were built in the period from 100 BC to 100 AD. Dun Carloway was probably built in the 1st century AD.I. Armit & N. Fojut, Dun Charlabhaigh and the Hebridean Iron Age (1998). P. 10 It probably got its current name from the Norse Karlavagr (\\"Karl's bay\\"), a relic of its time as part of the Kingdom of the Isles. Through the centuries Dun Carloway remained in use until the floor level was too high due to build-up of the occupation layers.C. Tabraham, Excavations at Dun Carloway broch, Isle of Lewis, Proc Soc Antiq Scot, 108 ( 1976-7) 156-167. The broch was occasionally used in later times as a stronghold. The Morrisons of Ness put Dun Carloway into use in 1601. The story goes that they had stolen cattle from the MacAuleys of Uig. The MacAuleys wanted their cattle back and found the Morrisons in the broch. One of them, Donald Cam MacAuley, climbed the outer wall using two daggers and managed to smoke out the inhabitants by throwing heather into the broch and then setting fire to it.F.W.L. Thomas, Traditions of the MacAuleys of Lewis , Proc Soc Antiq Scot, 14, 363-431.M. Coventry, The Castles of Scotland (2006), Fourth Edition, Birlinn Limited. . Blz. 268. The MacAuleys then destroyed the broch. Presumably in the 16th century the walls of the broch were still largely intact. By the middle of the 19th century a large portion of the top of the wall had disappeared, the stones being re-used in other buildings.I. Armit & N. Fojut, Dun Charlabhaigh and the Hebridean Iron Age. P. 25 The situation in 1861 is shown in a drawing published in 1890 by Captain Thomas.FWL. Thomas, Duns of the Outer Hebrides (1890), Archaeologica scotica, 5, 365-415. To prevent further decay Dun Carloway was in 1882 one of the first officially protected monuments in Scotland. Five years later, the broch was placed under state management. Since then, restoration has been performed on the broch. At the beginning of the 20th century and in the 1970s there was limited archaeological excavation. Construction Dun Carloway is built on a rock on a steep south slope at the height of 50 metres. It is the best preserved broch in the Outer Hebrides.C. Burgess, Ancient Lewis and Harris, Comhairle Nan Eilean Siar (2008). . P. 70. The wall of the broch rises on the south side to 9.2 metres.I. Armit, Towers in the North - The Brochs of Scotland (2003). P. 55. Only Mousa Broch and Dun Telve have walls that are higher. The original height of Dun Carloway is unknown. The broch overlooks Loch Carloway. Steps inside the Broch The external diameter is 14.3 metres; the internal diameter of the inner courtyard is 7.4 metres. The walls vary in thickness from 2.9 to 3.8 metres from the south-east to the north. The entrance is on the north-west side.I. Armit & N. Fojut, Dun Charlabhaigh and the Hebridean Iron Age (1998). P. 22. The entrance is 75 centimetres wide and 1 metre high. The walls on this side of the broch do not much exceed the height of the entrance capstone and there are no stones on top of the large capstone.WM Mackenzie, Notes on certain structures or archaic type in the island of Lewis - beehive houses, duns and stone circles, Proc Soc Antiq Scot, 38, 173-204. On the south side of the entrance-passage is a so-called \\"guard cell\\", a small side room in the hallway. The opening to the \\"guard cell\\" is 61 centimetres square. In the interior of the broch there are three additional openings. The opening on the eastern side, opposite the entrance, leads to the stairs located between the walls of the broch. The staircase runs along one quarter of the circumference of the broch. The north-eastern opening (to the left of the staircase opening) gives access to an oval room. Here are traces showing that there were at least three peat ovens over the centuries. The west opening (right, after entering the broch) provides access to a room under the staircase.I. Armit & N. Fojut, Dun Charlabhaigh and the Hebridean Iron Age (1998). P. 23. In the south-eastern wall two large wall voids are visible. On the north side of the interior protrudes the rock upon which the broch was built. It is likely that there was an upper wooden floor, as the scarcement (ledge) which could hold such a floor is visible 2 metres above ground level. Although the remaining wall is higher than nine metres, there is no trace of a higher scarcement found.I. Armit, Towers in the North - The Brochs of Scotland (2003). P. 67. This could mean that there was only one floor, or that a different method was used for higher floors. Finds Photo of the broch Excavation in the northeastern room found at least three peat-ovens used in the period 400-700. In this room were also a lot of pottery remains, as well as a fragment of a quern-stone and a collection of snail shells. The fireplaces contained no animal bones, which makes a domestic (preparing meals) use of the fires seem unlikely. A more industrial application is also unlikely because of the absence of tools that were used in making ironwork. Probably the northeastern room was only used for the manufacture of earthenware pots. Management Dun Carloway has been in state management since 1887I. Armit & N. Fojut, Dun Charlabhaigh and the Hebridean Iron Age (1998). P. 6. and is now owned by Historic Scotland.

The history of the DPC and its foundation date is unclear because it has many historical paths under different groups of founders. It is generally recognized to have assembled in 1998 by democracy activists and former student leaders from the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests according to western sources.Edmonds, Richard Louis.

Wu, Tim. (2006). Who Controls the Internet?: Illusions of a Borderless World. Oxford University Press. Wang Youcai, one of the main activists during the 1989 Tiananmen protest along with Wang Donghai and Lin Hui went to the Civil Public Affair Hall of Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province to officially register this party. The registration was declined. =Communist Party response= The next day on June 29, 1998, Wang was arrested by the state police at his home. He was charged with creating opposition against the Chinese government. His trial began on December 18, and as he had no lawyer defense, his trial lasted only a few hours. He was quickly sentenced on December 21, 1998 to 11 years of imprisonment and three years of deprivation of political rights for subversion. On the same day, Xu Wenli, a 55-year-old member was also sentenced to 13 years for overthrowing the Communist party.Mackerras, Colin. (2001). The New Cambridge Handbook of Contemporary China. On December 22, 1998, Qin Yongmin was sentenced to 12 years in prison for harming state securities. Li Peng, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress at the time proclaimed, \\"If a group is designed to negate the leadership of the Communist Party, then it will not be allowed to exist.\\" The Communist party declared the DPC an illegal organization, followed by a crackdown in Beijing in 1998. After the sentencing on December 23, 1998, the Supreme People's Court then declared that, \\"anyone who knowingly publishes, prints, copies, or distributes material containing incitement to overthrow state power and the socialist system or split the country\\" could be tried for crimes. Such charges could result in life sentences for film directors, computer software developers, writers and artists, and media and publishing personnel, all of whom are subject to the new directive. =Crackdown on other members= There were hundreds of DPC members who were detained, arrested, and sentenced to prison. Among them: *Liu Xianbin *Wu Yilong *Gao Hongmin *Zha Jianguo *Mao Qinxiang *Zhu Yufu *Zhu Zhengming *Liu Shizhun *Xu Guang *She Wanbao *Chen Shuqing *Xie Wanjun The above are some of the members of the party. Internet dissident He Depu was also arrested and detained in a correctional facility. =Present= Later Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai were exiled to the US on December 24, 2002 and March 4, 2004. On August 13, 2006, the first congress of the DPC was convened in the Sheraton Hotel of Flushing, Queens, New York in the United States. Ni Yu Xian, the leader of China's democracy movement, one of the founders of DPC and the China Freedom & Democracy Party, presided over the congress. A total of 111 delegates from all the provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China attended the Congress. The congress passed the Statutes of Democracy Party of China, Party Program, and some important resolutions. Democracy Party of China Coordinative Service Platform was founded by the members of Democracy Party of China members who are in China, overseas students, and exiled Democracy Party of China members. The initiative group members are Wang Youcai, Lin Hui, Chen Shuqing, Chen Zhiwei, Gao Yeju, Lv Gengsong, Xu Guang, Shan Chenfeng, along with many other members. In January 2008, party member Zheng Cunzhu established the Local Committee of Democracy Party of China. Zheng Cunzhu is a former student leader during 1989's pre-democratic movements in Anhui province, and he published an open letter to the leaders of China to advocate the restarting of political reform. Party summary The DPC suggests the ideas of \\"Prosperity, Fairness, Democracy\\" (ÂØåË£ï ÂÖ¨Âπ≥ Ê∞ë‰∏ª) and \\"Freedom, Rule-of-Law, Human rights\\" (Ëá™Áî± Ê≥ïÂà∂ ‰∫∫ÊùÉ/‰∫∫Ê¨ä). The DPC has four features: *The Chinese Democracy Party was founded in mainland China. *Based on the many documents issued by the Democracy Party of China Zhejiang Organizing Committee and the Beijing-Tianjin Party Office in 1998, especially the ‚ÄúDeclaration of the Democracy Party of China for the New Century‚Äù issued by Chinese Democracy Party United Headquarter on January 1, 2000, it is clear that the DPC is firmly established on a solid foundation of true democratic ideals. *The Chinese Democracy Party was founded by a large group of people.

He served as a justice of the Maryland Court of Appeals from 1778 until 1806. Benjamin was born into a large and prosperous Anglican family, that of Colonel John James Mackall (1717‚Äì1772) and Mary (Hance) Mackall.Edward C. Papenfuse, et al. \\"MACKALL, JAMES JOHN (1717-1772)\\", in A Biographical Dictionary of the Maryland Legislature 1635-1789 (Baltimore, 1979), 426:562. Besides tobacco, they raised five sons and eight daughters. Benjamin was the second son, so he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1765. He practiced law in both Calvert and several nearby counties. On November 20, 1769 Mackall married Rebecca Potts in Annapolis, Maryland. She was the sister of Richard Potts who would later serve with Benjamin on Maryland's Court of Appeals. Although not the eldest son, he did inherit a small farm in Calvert County from his father, which he expanded to 1,620 acres (7 km¬≤) by his death. Mackall was first elected to the colonial House of delegates in 1768. He served there for a number of years. He was a member of all the sessions of the revolutionary house known as the Annapolis Convention, including the one that adopted the Maryland Constitution of 1776. At one of these he gained his name of Benjamin Mackall IV, since he was the fourth of that name to sign the Declaration of Rights of Freeman of Maryland in 1775. (The other three Benjamins were all cousins). Mackall was a member of Calvert County's Committee of Safety in 1775 and 1776, and in 1776 followed in his father's path when he was chosen as the Colonel of the Calvert County militia. He later resigned this post when he was appointed to the court, believing that no one should hold more than one major office. Benjamin was appointed in 1778 as one of the first set of justices to the Court of Appeals, which was the highest court in the state. When the number of justices was reduced to three in 1801 he was one of those who continued to serve. He finally resigned in 1806 due to declining health. He died at home in 1807 on his plantation known as Godsgrace in Calvert County, and was buried in a family plot there.

It was developed by Scaled Composites from 2007 to 2010 as the first stage of Tier 1b, a two-stage to suborbital-space crewed launch system. WK2 is based on the successful mothership to SpaceShipOne, White Knight, which itself is based on Proteus. With an \\"open architecture\\" design and explicit plans for multi-purpose use, the aircraft could also operate as a zero-g aircraft for passenger training or microgravity science flights, handle missions in high- altitude testing more generally, or be used to launch payloads other than SpaceShipTwo. A study of use of the aircraft as a forest fire water bomber has also been mentioned, one that would utilize a large carbon composite water tank that could be quickly replenished to make repeat runs over fires. The first White Knight Two is named VMS Eve after Richard Branson's mother Eve Branson; it was officially unveiled on July 28, 2008, and flew for the first time on December 21, 2008. The second is expected to be named VMS Spirit of Steve Fossett after Branson's close friend Steve Fossett, who died in an aircraft accident in 2007. , it is not clear how many SS2 and WK2 vehicles will actually be built.  History  In 2008, Virgin Galactic ordered two White Knight Two vehicles. Together, WK2 and SS2 form the basis for Virgin Galactic's fleet of suborbital spaceplanes. In November 2010, The Spaceship Company had announced that it planned to build at least three additional White Knight Two aircraft and an additional five SpaceShipTwo rocket planes, the aircraft to be built by Virgin after the initial prototypes of each craft are built by Scaled Composites. Spacecraft factory to break ground in Mojave, Los Angeles Times, 2010-11-08, accessed 2010-11-09. During 2012‚Äì2014, Virgin Galactic was also considering use of the WhiteKnightTwo as the air-launch platform for a new two-stage liquid-fueled rocket small satellite launcher called LauncherOne. In the event‚Äîby late 2015‚Äîthey decided to use a larger carrier aircraft for the job. Design PW308 used on the White Knight Two White Knight Two is roughly three times larger than White Knight in order to perform a captive flight with the larger SpaceShipTwo spacecraft. The WK2 is similar in wingspan to a Boeing B-29 Superfortress. White Knight Two is a very modern aircraft, as even the flight control cables are constructed of carbon fiber, using a new patented design. WK2 will provide preview flights offering several seconds of weightlessness before the suborbital event. It is intended to have a service ceiling of about 60,000 ft (18 km), offering a dark blue sky to passengers. This will allow tourists to practice before the real flight. White Knight Two is of twin fuselage design with four jet engines mounted two on each wing. One fuselage is an exact replica of that of SpaceShipTwo (to allow tourist training), and the other will offer 'cut-rate' trips to the stratosphere. The design is quite different from the White Knight, both in size, use of tail, engine configuration and placement of cockpit(s). The White Knight uses two T-tails, but the White Knight Two uses two cruciform tails. Engine configuration is also very different. White Knight Two has four engines hung underneath the wings on pylons while White Knight's pair of engines are on either side of its single fuselage.

Branson predicted that the maiden space voyage would take place in 18 months: \\"It represents... the chance for our ever-growing group of future astronauts and other scientists to see our world in a completely new light.\\" On March 22, 2010 the VMS Eve completed its 25th flight, the first occasion it carried the SpaceShipTwo, VSS Enterprise.

Everton McLean played for Renton Union and Renton, before signing for Everton in 1890. He played a bit part in their first league title triumph in the following season. The departure of Andrew Hannah to Renton that summer gave McLean his chance to establish himself as the regular first choice right back at the club, although the club were unable to repeat the form of the previous year, finishing fifth. A summer of off the field turmoil followed in which directors, staff and players alike were forced to choose sides in a rent dispute over Anfield Road, which saw the club literally split in two. Liverpool Everton, along with the vast majority of players, staff and officials, moved out but McLean was one of only two first- teamers who chose to stay and help form the new club, Liverpool. His decision may have been a reaction to the news that Andrew Hannah was on his way back to Merseyside, which could have signalled McLean's drop back into the reserves but as fate would have it Hannah also chose the new club over his former employers with the result that Hannah and McLean became Liverpool's first ever back line partnership. At Liverpool he helped to form part of the famous \\"Team of the Macs\\", playing left-back in the first side to ever represent the Anfield club in a Lancashire League fixture, an 8‚Äì0 victory over Higher Walton on 3 September 1892, they went on to win the title and were duly elected to the Football League Division Two in 1893. McLean was also a member of the first Liverpool line-up in a Football League fixture away to Middlesbrough Ironopolis, a game which Liverpool won 2‚Äì0. They remained unbeaten and also beat Newton Heath, who became Man United in 1902, in the promotion test match, McLean, the club's penalty taker, bagged himself a very respectable 5 goals during the promotion campaign. McLean's fortunes, along with Liverpool's, took a downward dip as the Reds were relegated straight back down to the 2nd tier at the end of the 1894‚Äì95 season. St Bernard's and Scotland McLean left Anfield in 1895 moving to Edinburgh side St Bernard's where he ended his career. While with St Bernard's, McLean played for Scotland twice. His debut came on 21 March 1896 against Wales in a British Championship match at Carolina Port, Dundee, which Scotland won 4‚Äì0. His second match was on 27 March 1897 against Ireland at Ibrox Park, Glasgow, which Scotland won 5-1. His younger brother Andrew was also a professional footballer with Renton.

Norris (December 10, 1879 ‚Äì December 4, 1952) was a Canadian-American businessman, operating companies in the grain and cattle industries, and owner of the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League. He also had significant ownership interests in the Chicago Black Hawks and the New York Rangers. He is often referred to as James Norris Sr., to distinguish him from his son, James D. Norris. Norris is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, as are his sons James and Bruce Norris, but not Margurite his daughter who was Detroit Red Wings co-owner with brother Bruce and President from 1952-55. Early life and career Norris was born in Montr√©al, Quebec, Canada, the son of James Sylvester Norris (1849‚Äì1914) and Eleanor Waud. James Sylvester Norris was involved in a grain trading company, Norris and Carruthers. Norris lived in Montr√©al where the company owned an office and a warehouse and Carruthers lived in Toronto, where it rented premises in the Board of Trade building. His grandparents were Captain James Norris (1820‚Äì1891) and Sophrinia Neelon. Norris Place in St. Catharines, Ontario is named after Captain James Norris who was a sea captain, businessman, mayor of St Catharines and MP. His great grand parents were James Norris (1793‚Äì1839) and Nancy Ann Black. They left Scotland and settled in Caledon East, Peel, Ontario, Canada with their family about the year 1834. His first cousin once removed was Peter Blair Norris, named after his grandfather Peter Blair, of Belfountain, Ontario. His first cousin Captain Charles H. Norris settled in Maitland, Nova Scotia and by 1852 owned Norris & Sanderson, a large shipbuilder on Nova Scotia's Shubenacadie River and one of the world's largest sailing fleets. James Norris was not directly related by blood to Dr. John Knox Blair (1873‚Äì1950), a Member of Parliament for the Wellington North Riding, Ontario. He was an accomplished athlete in his youth, playing hockey, squash and tennis. He was a defenceman (point) at McGill University,[1] won the 1897 intermediate championship with the Montreal Hockey Club,Montreal Hockey Team, Intermediate Champions, [Montreal, Que.], 1897. and later played in 3 games in 1898 for the Montreal Hockey Club senior team. Norris' family had amassed substantial wealth in the 19th century, owning mills and a fleet of ships, along with several tracts of land. His father moved Norris Grain Inc. to Chicago when Norris was 18 years old. Norris also moved to Chicago and became president of Norris Grain at the age of 28 in 1908. In the early 1900s he also played hockey in Chicago with the Kenwood Country Club and Chicago Wanderers teams. In business he began buying grain elevators in the 1910s and was the largest cash grain buyer in the world in the 1930s. He also ran Norris Cattle Company, which operated three of the largest cattle ranches in the United States. His net worth was said to be over $200 million by 1940. Norris became a US citizen in 1919. National Hockey League When the NHL announced in 1926 that it would place a team in Chicago, Norris made a bid for the team, but lost to Frederic McLaughlin. Norris was one of the financial backers of the Chicago Stadium, which opened in March 1929. At that time, Norris and Stadium president Paddy Harmon had discussions with Frank Patrick about bringing another hockey team to Chicago, but under NHL rules, that would only be possible with McLaughlin's approval, which he would not give.Lords of the Rinks: The Emergence of the National Hockey League, 1875-1936, John Chi-Kit Wong, University of Toronto Press, 2005 McLaughlin found negotiations with Harmon and Norris for ice time at the Stadium to be difficult, but the two sides came to an agreement during the 1929‚Äì30 season. Later in 1930, Norris was one of the backers of the Chicago Shamrocks of the minor league American Hockey Association, which changed its name to the American Hockey League (no relation to the current circuit). The AHL was declared an \\"outlaw league\\" by NHL president Frank Calder, and in an attempt to separate Norris from the league, the NHL let Norris know that he would be welcomed as an NHL owner. Norris withdrew his support from the Shamrocks (the team disbanded after the 1931‚Äì32 season). In May 1932, Norris applied to the NHL for a team in St. Louis, but this was rejected by the league because of concerns over travel expenses for the other teams. Norris had an agreement to buy the financially struggling Ottawa Senators, and intended to move the team to Chicago or Toronto. McLaughlin said he would not allow a second team into Chicago, and Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe rejected the idea of another team in his city.\\"Ottawa's N.H.L. franchise may lead to clash,\\" Toronto Star, May 27, 1932, p. 12. In 1931, the Detroit Falcons and their arena, the Detroit Olympia, had been placed into receivership and were being managed by a creditors' committee. By the summer of 1932, it was being reported that the team might be sold to Norris.\\"Stop! Look! Listen!,\\" Toronto Star, August 16, 1932, p. 6. In the fall of 1932, the NHL formally approved Norris' bid to acquire the team from the receiver. He changed the team's name to the Detroit Red Wings. Norris also designed the team's current logo: a wing protruding from a wheel. The logo was adapted from the old Montreal Hockey Club logo (the team had been nicknamed the \\"Winged Wheelers\\") and was intended to curry favour with the automobile companies. Norris quickly cleared away the debt left over from past years and gave the Red Wings the financial backing they needed to become one of the most powerful teams in the NHL. Under Norris' watch, the Red Wings won five Stanley Cups. He rarely saw his Red Wings play due to a heart condition. However, coach and general manager Jack Adams always called Norris after each game from the locker room. When Frederic McLaughlin died in 1944, Norris helped longtime Black Hawks president Bill Tobin put together a syndicate that bought the team from the McLaughlin estate. It was generally understood, however, that Norris called the shots. He had bought Chicago Stadium in 1936, thus making him the Black Hawks' landlord. Earlier in the decade, he had bought enough stock in Madison Square Garden to become its largest stockholder, and while he did not buy majority control (he was forbidden from doing so by the NHL constitution), he had enough support from the board that he effectively controlled the New York Rangers as well. Norris's loans to the Boston Bruins during the 1930s gave him significant control over that franchise as a creditor as well, which effectively gave him control of the majority of the league. Death and legacy Norris died on December 4, 1952, in Chicago and was buried in Mattituck, New York. Upon his death, the shipping company he financed, Upper Lakes Shipping, named a Great Lakes bulk carrier after him. The ship remained in service until it was scrapped in 2012‚Äì2013. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958. The James Norris Memorial Trophy, awarded to the top defenceman in the NHL, first awarded in 1954 was named in his honour.

It was also the name of a hill in Germania described by classical sources. But the two are probably not the same. Melibokus overlooks the Rhine valley on the western fringe of the Odenwald region and is a local landmark, clearly visible for many miles. On the summit there is a small cafe, a public lookout tower and a US Army radio mast erected on the site of a previous stone tower, destroyed during World War II. The hill is accessible from Zwingenberg/Bergstrasse by foot. The \\"Nibelungensteig\\" hill trail leads you from the railway station in Zwingenberg towards the east. Despite the modern use of the classical name, the mountain mentioned in classical sources was probably either the Harz mountains, or Thuringian Forest or both. Ptolemy's Geography (Book 2, Chapter 10) mentions the Melobokon oros, as being just to the south of the Cherusci, corresponding to the mountainous \\"Silva Bacenis\\" which Julius Caesar mentioned as separating the Cherusci and the Chatti in Hesse. The medieval place name of the modern Melibokus was Mons Malscus, and there is a settlement in the region, Malchen.

It is the high point of the San Mateo Mountains and the highest point in the Cibola National Forest. It was named in 1849 for then president Zachary Taylor. Prior to that, it was called Cebolleta (tender onion) by the Spanish; the name persists as one name for the northern portion of the San Mateo Mountains, a large mesa. Mount Taylor is largely forested with some meadows, rising above the desert below. The ancient caldera is heavily eroded to the east. Its slopes were an important source of lumber for neighboring pueblos. Mount Taylor is the cone in a larger volcanic field, including Mesa Chivato. The Mount Taylor volcanic field is composed primarily of basalt (with 80% by volume) and straddles the extensional transition zone between the Colorado Plateau and the Rio Grande rift. The largest volcanic plug in the volcanic field is Cabezon Peak, which rises nearly 2,000 feet above the surrounding plain. According to Robert Julyan's The Place Names of New Mexico, the Navajos identify Cabezon Peak \\"as the head of a giant killed by the Twin War Gods\\" with the lava flow to the south of Grants believed to be the congealed blood of the giant. Native American traditions A view of Mount Taylor to the north from the west end of the Sky City of Acoma Pueblo. A southwest view of Mount Taylor, as seen from the village of Encinal, NM. To the Navajo people, Mount Taylor is ', the blue bead mountain, sometimes translated Turquoise Mountain, one of the four sacred mountains marking the cardinal directions and the boundaries of the Dinetah, the traditional Navajo homeland. Mount Taylor marks the southern boundary, and is associated with the direction south and the color blue; it is gendered female. In Navajo mythology, First Man created the sacred mountains from soil from the Fourth World, together with sacred matter, as replicas of mountains from that world. He fastened Mount Taylor to the earth with a stone knife. The supernatural beings Black God, Turquoise Boy, and Turquoise Girl are said to reside on the mountain. Mount Taylor is also sacred to the Acoma, Hopi, Laguna and Zuni people. Volcanology Mount Taylor was active from 3.3 to 1.5 million years ago during the Pliocene, and is surrounded by a field of smaller inactive volcanoes. Repeated eruptions built lava domes and produced lava flows, ash plumes, and mudflows. The mountain is surrounded by a great volume of volcanic debris, suggesting multiple major eruptions, possibly similar to that of Mount Saint Helens and the San Francisco Peaks near Flagstaff, Arizona. Estimates vary about how high the mountain was at its highest. Conservative estimates place its maximum near a similar pre-explosion height for the San Francisco Peaks of , and an extreme estimate places it near . Recreation Mount Taylor is the site of the Mount Taylor Winter Quadrathlon, an endurance event which has been held at this location for over thirty years, with the 2019 event being the 36th. The event includes bicycling, running, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing for 43 miles from the town of Grants to the summit and back. Since 2012 there has also been a 50-kilometer running race on Mount Taylor, sponsored by the Albuquerque Roadrunners club. Competitors who complete the 50 km run in the fall and the Quadrathlon in the following winter are known as 'Doublers' and earn a special award. Wildlife Mount Taylor and the surrounding area is home to large elk herds, mule deer, black bear, mountain lion and wild turkey. Bird species are particularly diverse in the area and include great blue heron, white-faced ibis, canvasback, common merganser, rough-legged hawk, red-tailed hawk, ferruginous hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, osprey, golden eagle, barn owl, great horned owl, and kestrel, whip-poor-will, white-throated swift, western kingbird, warbling vireo, western meadowlark, house finch, swifts, swallows, prairie falcon, gray-headed junco, Steller's jay, and pinyon jay. Furthermore, the area offers excellent raptor-nesting habitat on the various cliffs that spill down into the Rio Puerco valley below. Mining Mount Taylor uranium mine, New Mexico. Mount Taylor is very rich in a uranium-vanadium bearing mineral, and was mined extensively for it from 1979 to 1990. The Mount Taylor and the hundreds of other uranium mines on Pueblo lands have provided over thirteen million tons of uranium ore to the United States since 1945. Concern has arisen regarding the impact of future mining activities on the site. In June 2008 the New Mexico Cultural Properties Review Committee voted in favor of a one-year emergency listing of more than surrounding the mountain's summit on the state Register of Cultural Properties. \\"The Navajo Nation, the Acoma, Laguna and Zuni pueblos, and the Hopi tribe of Arizona asked the state to approve the listing for a mountain they consider sacred to protect it from an anticipated uranium mining boom, according to the nomination report.\\" In April 2009, Mount Taylor was added to the National Trust for Historic Preservation's list of America's Most Endangered Places. Notable events On 3 September 1929, the Transcontinental Air Transport Ford 5-AT-B Tri-Motor City of San Francisco struck Mount Taylor during a thunderstorm while on a scheduled passenger flight from Albuquerque Airport in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to Los Angeles, California, killing all eight people on board.Aviation Safety Network: Accident Description See also *Capulin Volcano National Monument *El Malpais National Monument *San Mateo Mountains (Cibola County, New Mexico) NotesReferencesExternal links * Cibola National Forest official website * * Category:Volcanoes of New Mexico Category:Mountains of New Mexico Category:Cibola National Forest Category:Landforms of Cibola County, New Mexico Category:Religious places of the indigenous peoples of North America Category:Sacred mountains Category:Stratovolcanoes of the United States Category:Pliocene volcanoes Category:Pleistocene volcanoes Category:Neogene geology of New Mexico Category:Quaternary geology of New Mexico Category:Pleistocene United States Category:Mountains of Cibola County, New Mexico ","title":"Mount Taylor (New Mexico)"},{"id":"2461758","text":"Cover illustration of a Hagenbund i1904-1905 Joseph Urban The Hagenbund or K√ºnstlerbund Hagen was a group of Austrian artists that formed in 1899. The group's name derived from the name Herr Hagen, the proprietor of an inn in Vienna which they frequented. Early history The group's most prominent members early on were Heinrich Lefler and Joseph Urban, who had originally worked and exhibited within the conservative Vienna K√ºnstlerhaus, but now, like the Vienna Secession, rebelled against the establishment and formed their own organization. The Hagenbund operated for almost a decade in the shadow of the popular and successful Secession, and only in the years that followed the damaging resignation of the Klimt Group from the Secession did its members succeed in developing a more moderate, independent line, in which atmosphere played a major role. After World War I After 1918, the formal language of the Hagenbund came to dominate artistic activity in Vienna, and in the 1920s it provided the most important focus for new artistic currents. Among its members during this period were Theodore Fried, Oskar Laske, Anton Hanak, Carry Hauser, Georg Mayer-Marton, George Merkel, Sergius Pauser, Fritz Schwarz-Waldegg, Otto Rudolf Schatz, Albin Egger-Lienz and Oskar Kokoschka. They disassociated themselves from both the Secession and Expressionism on essential questions of aesthetics. They may have approved of the Expressionists‚Äô search for realism, but the expressive formal solutions they found conflicted with the Hagenbund‚Äôs own artistic objectives. The Dissolution of the Hagenbund in 1938 In March 1938, a few days after the Anschluss of Austria into the German Reich, the administration of both the Hagenbund and the Secession were brought into in to line with the thinking of the Nazi party by existing members of the respective organisation. In the case of the Hagenbund the leading figure was Leopold Blauensteiner and the art of the Hagenbund was described as Verfalstkunst or decadent art. Many of the Jewish members of the Hagenbund were to flee from Austria at this point and the assets of the Hagenbund were re-allocated to the Association of Visual Artists. It was declared defunct on 29 September 1938.Klamber E.

Armstrong (November 18, 1920 ‚Äì July 28, 2004) was a mechanical engineer, inventor, editor, prolific author, and model railroader best known for layout design and operations. He was married for 44 years to Ellen Palmer. They had four children. Early life He was born and raised in Canandaigua, New York, and began designing his Canandaigua Southern Railroad model layout when he was 14 years old. After earning a mechanical engineering degree from Purdue University, he settled in Silver Spring, Maryland in the late 1940s. He was employed at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory of the United States Navy in White Oak, Maryland and contributed to the design of weapons systems for nuclear submarines. Following his retirement from the Navy, he was a contributing editor for Railway Age magazine for ten years. Model railroad construction In evenings and on weekends he began building his Canandaigua Southern Railroad O scale layout in the basement of the modest Armstrong family home, carefully cutting the cross-ties from balsa wood, setting them on rail-beds made from scale-sized gravel, and then laying out each length of track and carefully nailing it into place with tiny railroad spikes to scale that were hammered into the cross-ties one at a time. Armstrong was extensively published in the U.S. model railroading press. He has over 300 references in the Trains Magazine Index.http://trc.trains.com/Train%20Magazine%20Index.aspx?view=SearchResults&q;=John+Armstrong Influence on the hobby Armstrong wrote many books and articles on the subject of railroading and model railroading. His personal model railroad, the Canandaigua Southern, was the subject of many newspaper and magazine articles by other writers. In the late 1940s, Armstrong submitted a track plan to a contest sponsored by the magazine Model Railroader. His plan was so successful that it led to an invitation to contribute an article to the magazine on the Canandaigua Southern, which appeared in 1946. He remained a regular writer for the magazine, contributing 76 articles over his lifetime. His last article, was 'Main line through the mountains', was published posthumously in the April 2005 issue. He also held at least four patents. Armstrong was well known in the model railroad community in part through his memberships in the National Model Railroad Association, the Capital Area O Scalers and the Lexington Group. He was named to the O Scale Hall of Fame in 1998. He was a two-time recipient of the National Model Railroad Association's Distinguished Service Award, in 1968 and 1997, and was named an NMRA Pioneer of Model Railroading in 2001. Death Armstrong died in Montgomery Village, Maryland of complications due to pulmonary disease on July 28, 2004, and was widely mourned.http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/washingtonpost/obituary.aspx?pid=2486049  Selected books and articles  * \\"All About Signals\\" (Two-article series).

He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in the late 1960s. He was (1945 - 1950) a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Holan was born in Prague, but he spent most of his childhood outside the capital. When he moved back in the 1920s he studied law and started a job as a clerk, a position that was a large source of dissatisfaction for the poet. He lost his father and in 1932 married Vƒõra Pila≈ôov√°. In the same year he published the collection of poems Vanut√≠ (Breezing), which he considered his first piece of poetic art (there were two books preceding it: Blouzniv√Ω vƒõj√≠≈ô /1926/ and Triumf smrti /1930/). It was his only collection to be reviewed by the knight of Czech critics, Franti≈°ek Xaver ≈†alda, who compared Holan favorably with the French poet St√©phane Mallarm√©. In the 1930s Holan continued writing obscure lyrical poetry and slowly started to express his political feelings (reacting to the Spanish Civil War at first). Political poems Odpovƒõƒè Francii (The Reply to France), Z√°≈ô√≠ 1938 (September 1938) and Zpƒõv t≈ô√≠kr√°lov√Ω (Twelfth Night Song) were reactions to the situation in Czechoslovakia from September 1938 till March 1939. They also made him more intelligible and popular. The poem called Sen (The Dream) is a presage of a cruel war (amazingly published in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in April 1939). During the war he published several poetic stories in verse inspired by national humiliation. After the war he published an apocalyptic record of events in his Panychida and chanted about the Red Army in Tobƒõ (To You), Rudoarmƒõjci (Red Army Soldiers) and D√≠k Sovƒõtsk√©mu svazu (Thanks to the Soviet Union). He left the Catholic Church and became a member of the Communist Party. In 1949 after the communist takeover he was involved in an incident against Soviet influence in the new regime and his work was on the index of Czech literature. He left the Communist Party and reentered the Catholic Church. In the last years of his life he lived in reclusive poverty in the very heart of Prague on the island of Kampa. In the 1950s and 1960s he wrote longer poems mixing reality and lyrical abstraction. He is best known in English for his postwar works, both the often teasingly obscure longer poem Noc s Hamletem (A Night with Hamlet, 1964) which became the most often translated Czech poem,Ji≈ô√≠ Rulf, Vladim√≠r Holan and his short, gnomic lyrical reflections, with occasional submerged notes of political protest. He became a legendary poet-recluse.

Biography Clay was born in Austin, Texas and raised in Hawaii. He is Afro-Asian. His mother, Michele Ishimoto, was a Japanese immigrant to America. His father, Greg Clay, was African-American. His parents divorced when he was in elementary school and he was raised primarily by his mother. Clay has a younger brother, Nikolas, who was also a standout athlete on the Azusa Pacific University track team. On March 23, 2013 Bryan Clay was inducted into the Azusa Pacific Hall of Fame in Track and Field. He graduated from James B. Castle High School (Kaneohe, Hawaii) in 1998. Clay is married to Sarah Smith. They have a son, Jacob (born 2005) and two daughters, Katherine (Kate) (born 2007) and Elizabeth (Ellie) (born 2010). Clay believes that a balance of mental, physical and emotional health will help him in athletic competition. Clay addressed the 2008 Republican National Convention. Clay is a devoted Christian. Athletic career He competed in track and field in high school, during which time he was coached by Dacre Bowen and Martin Hee. He then attended Azusa Pacific University, an Evangelical Christian college near Los Angeles, California, where he competed in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics and was coached by Mike Barnett, who still coaches him. Clay still trains at Azusa Pacific University. Clay decided to compete in the decathlon after persuasion from Olympian Chris Huffins. Clay won the silver medal at the 2004 Olympics, and finished first at the 2005 World Championships. He was unable to complete the 2007 World Championships due to injuries, dropping out after four events. Clay won the gold medal at the 2008 Olympics in the decathlon. His victory margin of 240 points in the 2008 Beijing Olympics was the largest since 1972. The Olympic decathlon champion is referred to as the \\"World's Greatest Athlete\\" and prior to the Olympics, Clay was tested by SPARQ to establish his SPARQ Rating across a number of different sports. The test is meant to measure sport-specific athleticism and in the football test Clay recorded a score of 130.40, the highest ever recorded up to that point. By comparison, Reggie Bush scored a 93.38 on the popular test. He is one of two Olympians featured on a special edition post-Beijing Olympics Wheaties cereal box; the other was gymnast Nastia Liukin. His attempts to regain his World Championships decathlon title were thwarted by a hamstring injury in June 2009. This caused him to drop out of the US trials; thus, he missed the chance to compete at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin.Injury ends Clay's decathlon bid. BBC Sport (2009-06-25).

In 2012, Clay had returned to the Olympic Trials in hopes of making a third Olympics and defending his title. Defending the title was a feat only achieved twice, by Bob Mathias and by Daley Thompson. That attempt was quashed at the beginning of the second day, when he tripped over the 9th hurdle in the 110 metres hurdles, then off balance pushed over the 10th hurdle. He was initially disqualified for pushing over the hurdle, but that decision was reversed, allowing him a mark for running 16.81, last in the field over a second and a half slower than the next best competitor.http://www.legacy.usatf.org/events/2012/OlympicTrials- TF/Results/Results39-6.htm Thinking he had been disqualified in the hurdles, Clay followed the hurdle accident with three straight fouls in the discus throws, but he still completed the competition.

Vocalist Exene Cervenka, singer/bassist John Doe and drummer DJ Bonebrake were three of the four members of the punk band X; guitarist Dave Alvin was a member of roots rock band The Blasters as well as The Flesh Eaters; and stand-up bassist Jonny Ray Bartel was a member of blues-rock band The Red Devils. The Knitters' debut album Poor Little Critter on the Road was released in 1985. It included mainly traditional and cover songs, together with some X songs performed in an acoustic style. The album drew on blues, folk, country and rockabilly influences. In 1999, the label Bloodshot Records released a track-by-track tribute to the album entitled Poor Little Knitter on the Road. After the debut album's release, all the group members continued to work with their primary bands. Dave Alvin also later pursued a solo career. Twenty years later, in 2005, the group released their second and ironically-titled album, The Modern Sounds of the Knitters.

History St Mary le Port is said to have been founded in Saxon times after Anglo-Saxon foundations were found during archaeological excavationsM Q Smith, The Medieval Churches of Bristol, University of Bristol (Bristol branch of the Historical Association), 1970, p. 4. and Saxon pottery was found nearby.Bristol in the Early Middle Ages, University of Bristol (Bristol branch of the Historical Association), 1971, p6. The church was rebuilt and enlarged between the 11th and 16th centuries. During the 19th and early 20th centuries the church was a very popular centre of evangelical, Protestant, and Calvinist teaching within Anglicanism. St Mary le Port, Bristol by John Piper (1940) (Tate N05718) The church was bombed in the Second World War on 24 November 1940 during the Bristol Blitz. John Piper painted an evocative picture of the bombed St Mary le Port. This image appears on the 1/6d British commemorative stamp, part of a set of four paintings by British artists issued in 1968. All that remains of the church is the 15th-century tower, a Grade II listed building, and a Scheduled Ancient Monument which during the latter years of the 20th century was surrounded by the buildings of Norwich Union and the Bank of England. After the bombing in 1940 the congregation and their rector, William Dodgson-Sykes, moved to St John on the Wall Church, where the congregation remained, in gradually declining numbers, till this church building was closed for worship by the Church Commissioners in 1984 (after a protracted struggle by the congregation). The remaining congregation then moved to the Chapel of Foster's Almshouses, and joined the Church of England (Continuing) in 1995. The C of E (Continuing) no longer lists a congregation in Bristol; some of the congregation joined with the new Free Presbyterian Church (Ulster) congregation in Horfield, Bristol. Archives Although many of the parish records of St Mary le Port church were destroyed when the church was bombed, some archive material is held at Bristol Archives (Refs. P.

The problem of large ships being unable to enter the river made it difficult for bags of sugar from the district sugar mills to be transported to southern refineries. To overcome this problem, shallow draft steam ships and lighters were used to carry the bags of sugar out to meet larger ships. The small ships became known as \\"The Mosquito Fleet\\".

Early life and career McKenna was born on 3 January 1855 in Donagh Parish, Glaslough, Ireland. He was the son of Patrick McKenna and Jane McCrudden. In the 1870s he moved to Liverpool seeking work which he soon found at a grocery store, and later as a vaccination officer for the West Derby Union. McKenna had a keen interest in sports, particularly rugby, as well as football and shooting sports. He helped form a regimental rugby club and joined the West Lancashire County Rugby Football Union. Liverpool F.C. McKenna met the founder of Liverpool Football Club John Houlding, who invited him to Anfield to watch his Everton team play. He remained with Houlding after Everton left Anfield for Goodison Park. Houlding was a major driving force for Liverpool throughout the early years, and he used his connections to look for players in Glasgow. His team was known as the \\"Team of Macs\\" due to the number of players with \\"Mc\\" in their surname: Duncan McLean, James McBride, Malcolm McVean, Hugh McQueen, Matt McQueen, John McCartney, Bill McOwen and Joe McQue. Acting as the club's secretary, McKenna telegraphed the Football League asking for Liverpool to be admitted, but was denied entry by the Football Association. This refusal forced McKenna to guide Liverpool through the ranks of the Lancashire League on his own. Liverpool played their first game with an 8‚Äì0 win at Anfield against Higher Walton, with John Smith scoring the first competitive goal. After ending their first competitive season as champions, Liverpool were elected into the Football League, and played their first Football League match away to Middlesbrough Ironopolis on 2 September 1893, and won 2‚Äì0. McKenna served as Liverpool's chairman from 1906-1915. He was elected president of the Football League in 1917, a position he held for nearly 20 years until his death in March 1936. He had served Liverpool for over 40 years. Like Houlding, McKenna was an active freemason, attending Cecil Lodge No. 3274. Death and legacy His coffin was carried through the city by three Liverpool players and three Everton players. A plaque in commemoration to him remains in the foyer in Anfield. In August 2011, a commemorative plaque in honour of Liverpool FC's first manager John McKenna was unveiled in Glaslough in County Monaghan, Ireland. Over 200 people attended an informative talk on McKenna by Keith Falkiner, author of the book Emerald Anfield, in the local community hall before the plaque was unveiled by Kopite and LFC Donegal secretary David Moen. At the conclusion of his talk, Falkiner summed up the achievements of McKenna, saying, \\"The course of history has proven John McKenna to be one of the most powerful and successful men at Liverpool Football Club - the third most important figure, in my opinion, after only Bill Shankly and the clubs founder John Houlding.

History Camden Arts Centre is situated at the corner of Arkwright Road and Finchley Road, NW3 in a Grade II listed premises, constructed as Hampstead Central Library and designed by the architect Arnold Taylor. The building was opened in 1897 by its benefactor Sir Henry Harben, then Deputy Chairman of the Prudential Assurance Company. The Victorian structure funded by Harben survived World War II, despite hits by enemy incendiary bombs in 1940 and the blast from a V2 rocket in 1945. The library grew in size and was extended in the 1920s, however by 1964 a new facility opened in Swiss Cottage which was better able to cope with the demands of the modern library service and all stock was transferred to it. The Centre was founded in 1965 in West Hampstead. It was originally named Hampstead Arts Centre and renamed \\"Camden Arts Centre\\" in 1967. It provided the local community with classes in painting, life drawing, pottery, printing an\`d basic design. The first exhibition was held a year after the Centre was established. Director Jenni Lomax OBE joined Camden Arts Centre in 1990, and has established an internationally acclaimed programme of exhibitions, residencies, artists‚Äô projects and public events. She led the organisation through a major building refurbishment scheme which was completed in early 2004 by Tony Fretton Architects. It was rebranded \\"Camden Art Centre\\" by Pentagram in 2020.

Between 20 and 15 million years ago, the region from north-central Washington to northeastern California experienced a series of volcanic eruptions and basalt lava floods that covered thousands of square miles. These ancient lava floods often dammed streams, creating lakes and swamps that may have lasted for millions of years before filling with sediment or draining as erosion slowly lowered their outlets. The western Snake River plain contained many such lakes, and geologists believe that between 8 and 2 million years ago, \\"Lake Idaho\\" covered much of central eastern Oregon. Sediment deposited in this lake once covered Malheur Butte, and during the last 2 million years the Malheur River and other eroding forces slowly exposed and shaped today's landmark. Although Malheur Butte has been inactive for millions of years, Malheur County is still alive with geothermal activity in the form of hot springs. The rock is slightly over 100 meters higher than the surrounding plains and the peak is 790 meters above sea level.

Nikolay Ivanovich Novikov () (, Moscow Governorate ‚Äì . Moscow Governorate) was a Russian writer and philanthropist most representative of his country's Enlightenment. Frequently considered to be the first Russian journalist, he aimed at advancing the cultural and educational level of the Russian public. Novikov belonged to the first generation of Russians that benefited from the creation of Moscow University in 1755. He took an active part in the Legislative Assembly of 1767, which sought to produce a new code of laws. Inspired by this kind of freethinking activity, he took over editing the Moscow Gazette and launched satirical journals, including Zhivopisets, patterned after The Tatler and The Spectator. His attacks on the existing social customs prompted jocund retorts from Catherine the Great, who even set her own journal called Vsyakaya vsyachina to comment on Novikov's articles. Together with Johann Georg Schwarz, Ivan Lopukhin, and Semyon Gamaleya he brought martinism and rosicrucianism to Russia.Raffaella Faggionato A Rosicrucian Utopia in Eighteenth-Century Russia Springer, the Netherlands 1997 By the 1780s, Novikov rose to the highest positions in Russian Freemasonry, which liberally funded his ambitious book-publishing ventures. Novikov's press produced a third part of contemporary Russian books and several newspapers. Novikov used his influence for various noble purposes, such as a large-scale project of promoting Shakespeare to the Russian public. When the French Revolution started, Catherine changed her attitude towards the likes of Novikov. His printing house was confiscated. Three years later, without a formal trial, he was incarcerated in the Shlisselburg Fortress for 15 years. Much of his printed material was pulped, including 1,000 copies of Edward Young's The Last Day (1713).

It was known as the Bible Churchmen's Missionary Society (BCMS) until 1992. The BCMS was created as the result of a conservative split from the Church Missionary Society. Foundation BCMS was founded on 27 October 1922 as a result of a split in the Church Missionary Society (CMS). A number of CMS missionaries and supporters had become unhappy at its drift towards theological liberalism. BCMS was intended as a continuation of CMS's original theological and missionary principles. The Society was quickly established under the forceful leadership of Daniel Bartlett, who dominated its first 25 years. Another significant early supporter was Dean Wace.. While the parting was less than amicable, Bartlett ruled that all BCMS missionaries should transfer to areas where the CMS had not previously operated, in an attempt to restore charitable relations. Another priority was the establishment of a training college (1925) in line with BCMS's theology, which later became Trinity College, Bristol. The ecclesiastical historian Adrian Hastings has argued that this is one of the few English parallels to the Fundamentalism controversy in the US. He notes that BCMS differed from CMS by \\"only one word\\" ‚Äì Bible. However, it is noteworthy that in contrast to US examples, BCMS remained committed to the Church of England and the Church of Ireland, despite their theological diversity.

W. Mackay of Saskatchewan, Canada. He worked among the Inuit people of Canada. In 1923, work began in India, followed by China and Burma. In 1927, officials in Ethiopia invited BCMS to begin work there, but it was not until 1929 that BCMS's first missionaries to Africa arrived in Morocco. The same year saw a specific request to begin work in Kenya and Uganda. The worldwide turmoil around the Second World War led to the Society's withdrawal from a number of countries: Ethiopia (1937 war), Burma (1942 invasion), and China (1949‚Äì51 expulsion). The late 1940s also saw Bartlett finally relinquish leadership to A. T. Houghton. The following decades saw an increasing focus on East Africa, particularly the Karamoja area of Uganda,Ben Knighton The Vitality of Karamojong Religion: Dying Tradition or Living Faith?. Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing, 2005, pp. 70‚Äì74 (via Google Book Search) and the Diocese of Karamoja retains a strong Crosslinks connection. In the second half of the twentieth century, the tide of decolonisation led to the scaling down and rethinking of activities in Africa and India. BCMS/Crosslinks has participated in two trends common to most Western missionary societies: * Missionaries are as likely to come from the Global South as to go there. Given the distribution of Anglicans, this has tended to mean African mission partners joining Crosslinks. * The West is now seen as a mission field. Crosslinks brings African pastors to England and Ireland, it has an environmental protection programme in Western Europe (A Rocha) and starts new churches in urban England as it traditionally did in rural Africa. The Crosslinks name emphasises the society's principle that Mission is from everywhere to everywhere. The name also helps to make possible work in some of the 60 or so countries where Bible, Church and Missionary are not acceptable.

Biography Born as Marie Evelyn Moreton in London in 1870, she was the daughter of the Hon. Sir Richard Charles Reynolds-Moreton and Janie Ralli. Her father was comptroller at Rideau Hall during the term of Marquess of Lorne. She married, at St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge, on 30 April 1902, Colonel the Hon. Julian Byng, youngest son of the 2nd Earl of Strafford. They lived in India before the outbreak of the First World War, and moved to Canada on his appointment as Governor-General in 1921. He was created Baron Byng of Vimy in 1919, for his service during the war, and Viscount Byng of Vimy in 1928, after his service in Canada. They had no children. Lady Byng is best known today for donating the Lady Byng Trophy to the National Hockey League in 1925. She and her husband were both keen sports fans, especially of ice hockey, and they attended many Ottawa Senators games. They donated the trophy because Lady Byng appreciated gentlemanly play and good sportsmanship and wanted to encourage and reward it. At the end of his term as Governor General, Lord and Lady Byng returned to Thorpe Hall, their home in Essex, England. They continued to travel together, visiting friends in South Africa, Jamaica, California and Canada, until Lord Byng's death in 1935. With the outbreak of war in 1939, the area around her home became vulnerable to enemy attacks, and the Home Secretary, Sir John Anderson, urged her to evacuate to Canada for the duration. She remained in Canada from 1940 to the end of the war, visiting western Canada before making her temporary home in Ottawa. While there, she wrote her memoirs, Up The Stream of Time. She also worked at volunteer jobs, including a local thrift shop to raise funds for the Red Cross and The Women's Active Service Club, a haven for non-commissioned women in all three services branches.

Accordingly, the necessary condition of extremum (functional derivative equal zero) appears in a weak formulation (variational form) integrated with an arbitrary function . The fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations is typically used to transform this weak formulation into the strong formulation (differential equation), free of the integration with arbitrary function. The proof usually exploits the possibility to choose concentrated on an interval on which keeps sign (positive or negative). Several versions of the lemma are in use. Basic versions are easy to formulate and prove. More powerful versions are used when needed. Basic version :If a continuous function f on an open interval (a,b) satisfies the equality :: \\\\int_a^b f(x)h(x)\\\\,\\\\operatorname{d}x = 0 :for all compactly supported smooth functions h on (a,b), then f is identically zero. Here \\"smooth\\" may be interpreted as \\"infinitely differentiable\\", but often is interpreted as \\"twice continuously differentiable\\" or \\"continuously differentiable\\" or even just \\"continuous\\", since these weaker statements may be strong enough for a given task. \\"Compactly supported\\" means \\"vanishes outside [c,d] for some c, d such that a\\"; but often a weaker statement suffices, assuming only that h (or h and a number of its derivatives) vanishes at the endpoints a, b; in this case the closed interval [a,b] is used. Version for two given functions :If a pair of continuous functions f, g on an interval (a,b) satisfies the equality :: \\\\int_a^b ( f(x) \\\\, h(x) + g(x) \\\\, h'(x) ) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x = 0 :for all compactly supported smooth functions h on (a,b), then g is differentiable, and g' = f everywhere. The special case for g = 0 is just the basic version. Here is the special case for f = 0 (often sufficient). :If a continuous function g on an interval (a,b) satisfies the equality :: \\\\int_a^b g(x) \\\\, h'(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x = 0 :for all smooth functions h on (a,b) such that h(a)=h(b)=0, then g is constant. If, in addition, continuous differentiability of g is assumed, then integration by parts reduces both statements to the basic version; this case is attributed to Joseph-Louis Lagrange, while the proof of differentiability of g is due to Paul du Bois-Reymond. Versions for discontinuous functions The given functions (f, g) may be discontinuous, provided that they are locally integrable (on the given interval). In this case, Lebesgue integration is meant, the conclusions hold almost everywhere (thus, in all continuity points), and differentiability of g is interpreted as local absolute continuity (rather than continuous differentiability). Sometimes the given functions are assumed to be piecewise continuous, in which case Riemann integration suffices, and the conclusions are stated everywhere except the finite set of discontinuity points. Higher derivatives :If a tuple of continuous functions f_0,f_1,\\\\dots,f_n on an interval (a,b) satisfies the equality :: \\\\int_a^b ( f_0(x) \\\\, h(x) + f_1(x) \\\\, h'(x) + \\\\dots + f_n(x) \\\\, h^{(n)}(x) ) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x = 0 :for all compactly supported smooth functions h on (a,b), then there exist continuously differentiable functions u_0,u_1,\\\\dots,u_{n-1} on (a,b) such that :: f_0 = u'_0, \\\\; f_1 = u_0+u'_1, \\\\; \\\\dots, \\\\; f_{n-1}=u_{n-2}+u'_{n-1}, \\\\; f_n = u_{n-1} :everywhere. This necessary condition is also sufficient, since the integrand becomes (u_0 h)' + (u_1 h')' + \\\\dots + (u_{n-1} h^{(n-1)})'. The case n = 1 is just the version for two given functions, since f=f_0=u'_0 and f_1=u_0, thus, f_0-f'_1 = 0. In contrast, the case n=2 does not lead to the relation f_0 - f'_1 + f_2 = 0, since the function f_2 = u_1 need not be differentiable twice. The sufficient condition f_0 - f'_1 + f_2 = 0 is not necessary. Rather, the necessary and sufficient condition may be written as f_0 - (f_1 - f'_2)' = 0 for n=2, f_0 - (f_1 - (f_2-f'_3)')' = 0 for n=3, and so on; in general, the brackets cannot be opened because of non-differentiability. Vector-valued functions Generalization to vector-valued functions (a,b)\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^d is straightforward; one applies the results for scalar functions to each coordinate separately, or treats the vector-valued case from the beginning. Multivariable functions :If a continuous multivariable function f on an open set \\\\Omega\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^d satisfies the equality :: \\\\int_\\\\Omega f(x) \\\\, h(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x = 0 :for all compactly supported smooth functions h on Œ©, then f is identically zero. Similarly to the basic version, one may consider a continuous function f on the closure of Œ©, assuming that h vanishes on the boundary of Œ© (rather than compactly supported).; the proof applies in both situations. Here is a version for discontinuous multivariable functions. :Let \\\\Omega\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^d be an open set, and f\\\\in L^2(\\\\Omega) satisfy the equality :: \\\\int_\\\\Omega f(x) \\\\, h(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x = 0 :for all compactly supported smooth functions h on Œ©. Then f=0 (in L2, that is, almost everywhere). Applications This lemma is used to prove that extrema of the functional : J[y] = \\\\int_{x_0}^{x_1} L(t,y(t),\\\\dot y(t)) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}t are weak solutions y:[x_0,x_1]\\\\to V (for an appropriate vector space V) of the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation : {\\\\partial L(t,y(t),\\\\dot y(t)) \\\\over \\\\partial y} = {\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\over \\\\mathrm{d}t} {\\\\partial L(t,y(t),\\\\dot y(t)) \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\dot y} .

Left is the Scotch pine on the castle wall; right is the south tower. Exterior view Map of Bensheim, showing the castle east of Auerbach Pine on castle wall near north tower Auerbach Castle is one of several fortresses along the Bergstrasse in southern Hesse, Germany. The castle was originally built by King Charlemagne (Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire) and rebuilt by Count Diether IV of the Katzenelnbogen dynasty in the second quarter of the 13th century. Today it remains standing atop a hill known as Urberg (part of the Melibokus) above the town of Bensheim-Auerbach.  History  The town of was mentioned for the first time in the Lorsch codex as \\"Urbach\\". Through the marriage of Hildegard von Henneberg, areas of the Bergstra√üe passed to Henry II of Katzenelnbogen in 1135. Henry was ennobled as an earl in 1138 by King Konrad III. At that time, Auerbach belonged to the County of Katzenelnbogen. Katzenelnbogen was sub- divided into the Lower County (around St. Goar on the Rhine) and the Upper County (in what is now southern Hesse, south of the Main). A stronghold was needed to provide security for the southern Katzenelnbogen dynasty; this included protection of the duties (tolls) collected at the town of Zwingenberg from travellers using the well-known north-south trading route along the Roman mountain road (Strada Montana, or Bergstrasse in German). Auerbach Castle was built on the strategically important Auerberg (Urberg) hill to address this need. Construction of the castle is believed to have begun about 1222 by the order of Earl Diether IV von Katzenelnbogen. The earliest mention of a castle on Urberg in the historical record appears in 1247, and the first document of the castle itself dates from 1257. In 1479 County Katzenelnbogen (including Auerbach Castle) passed to the Landgraviate of Hesse. The castle lost much of its strategic importance during the 16th century until, by the time of the Thirty Years War, it was no longer in military use. In 1674 (during the 1672‚Äì1679 Franco-Dutch War) the castle was conquered and set afire by an army under French Marshal Turenne, killing local people who had sought protection within its walls. The abandoned castle became a ruin over the following years. In 1820 the north tower of the castle collapsed, after which the Landgraviate of Hesse decided to secure (and partially rebuild) the ruins. In 1888 an inn was built in the former bailey, which was open year-round. During the 1950s, the south tower became inaccessible due to the deterioration of its wooden staircase. In 1989, construction began on a terraced restaurant; it opened the following year, increasing the attraction of the castle ruins to visitors. In 2007, the stairway in the south tower was repaired and reopened to the public.  Viniculture  In 1258 a vineyard called the Grafenweinberg was recorded, and in 1318 one called the Reubere. There is still viticulture at the site today.  Design  The triangular shape of the castle keep survives today. Between the wall (from the north to the south tower) and the inner courtyard were the kitchens, living quarters, stables and smithy. The original entrance, protected by a donjon, was in the wall between the north and former east tower. Between the wall (from the east to the south tower) and the inner courtyard were the grand hall, cellars and the castle chapel. In the east corner of the inner courtyard lies the original well, drilled vertically through of bedrock. The castle keep is surrounded by a ring wall which encloses the bailey. A further forecourt is enclosed by another ring wall. At the south side of this ring wall was the entrance to the estate. On 18 October 1356, a powerful earthquake shook the Rhine rift; the donjon collapsed onto the eastern and southeastern buildings. Beginning about 1370, large-scale reconstruction and expansion of the castle took place. The donjon was demolished, the entrance to the keep relocated and the northern shield wall was closed and raised. The entrance to the castle is now in the southwest corner, where it is protected by the south tower and an inner bailey. A -thick bastion was built in place of the east tower. This bastion (the first of its kind in Germany) was designed to protect the castle from cannon bombardment from the northeast. The north and south towers may have been raised at this time. These additional fortifications, ordered by the Counts of Katzenelnbogen, gave rise to the name Feste Urberg (Urberg Fort) and made Auerbach one of the most secure and modern castles in the world at that time.  Present day  Dinner theater and knights' tournaments (with medieval games) are regular features at the castle. Since spring 2007 the north and south towers are accessible to the public after extensive restoration.

Guillem was the top-ranking female dancer with the Paris Opera Ballet from 1984 to 1989, before becoming a principal guest artist with the Royal Ballet in London. She has performed contemporary dance as an Associate Artist of London's Sadler's Wells Theatre. Her most notable performances have included those in Giselle and in Rudolf Nureyev's stagings of Swan Lake and Don Quixote. In November 2014, she announced her retirement from the stage in 2015.\\"Goodbye Sylvie Guillem\\", The Economist (May/June 2015). Early life Guillem was born on 23 February 1965 in Paris. As a child, she trained in gymnastics under the instruction of her mother, a gymnastics teacher. In 1977 at age 11, she began training at the Paris Opera Ballet School where Claude Bessy, then director of the school, immediately noticed her exceptional capacities and potential, and in 1981 at age 16, she joined the company's corps de ballet. Initially she hated dancing, preferring gymnastics, but after taking part in her show she found she loved performing.The Culture Show; BBC broadcast (9 October 2013). Career In 1983, Guillem won the gold medal at the Varna International Ballet Competition, which later in the year earned her her first solo role, dancing the Queen of the Dryads in Rudolf Nureyev's staging of Don Quixote. In December 1984, after her performance in Nureyev's Swan Lake, she became the Paris Opera Ballet's youngest-ever √©toile, the company's top-ranking female dancer. In 1987 she performed the lead role in William Forsythe's contemporary ballet In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated with one of her favourite partners, Laurent Hilaire. In 1988 she was given the title role in a production of Giselle staged by the Royal Ballet to celebrate Nureyev's 50th birthday. Her performance was a success, and in the following year she left Paris for London, to become a freelance performer and one of the Royal Ballet's principal guest artists. Her desire to work independently from a company gained her the nickname \\"Mademoiselle Non\\". In 1995 Guillem created the dance television program, Evidentia, which won several international awards. In 1998 she staged her own version of Giselle for the Finnish National Ballet, and in 2001 restaged the ballet for La Scala Ballet in Milan. In 2001 she became the first winner of the Nijinsky Prize for the world's best ballerina, although in her acceptance speech she criticised the \\"supermarket culture\\" of such awards. In the same year, she controversially appeared nude and without make-up in a photo-shoot for French Vogue. In 2003 she directed the central section of a Nureyev tribute program, but was criticised for having the dancers perform in front of a giant projected backdrop of Nureyev, which the audience found distracting. By 2006 she had moved from ballet to contemporary dance, working with such performers as Akram Khan as an Associate Artist of the Sadler's Wells Theatre in London. In March 2015 Guillem embarked on an international farewell tour titled Life in Progress, featuring works by Khan, Russell Maliphant, Mats Ek and Forsythe. The tour concluded in Japan, and she gave her final performance live on Japanese television on 31 December 2015, performing Maurice B√©jart's Bol√©ro as the clock counted down to midnight. The performance ended right at the stroke of midnight on 1 January 2016. Repertoire Guillem's repertoire includes Giselle (Giselle), Swan Lake (Odette/Odile), Don Quixote (Kitri), In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated, Romeo and Juliet (Juliet), The Sleeping Beauty (Aurora), Bol√©ro, Cinderella, Notre-Dame de Paris, Raymonda, La Bayad√®re (Nikiya and Gamzatti), Fall River Legend, Prince of the Pagodas (Princess Rose), Hermann Schmermann, Le Martyre de Saint-S√©bastien, and Sacred Monsters (with Akram Khan). Personal life As of 2006, Guillem was in a long-term relationship with photographer Gilles Tapie. She is a supporter of environmental group Sea Shepherd.The Culture Show; BBC broadcast, 9 October 2013. She is a total vegan, saying, \\"I do not want any animal to die for me\\".

Published in 1953, it is the first James Bond book, and it paved the way for a further eleven novels and two short story collections by Fleming, followed by numerous continuation Bond novels by other authors. The story concerns the British secret agent James Bond, gambling at the casino in Royale-les-Eaux to bankrupt Le Chiffre, the treasurer of a French union and a member of the Russian secret service. Bond is supported in his endeavours by Vesper Lynd, a member of his own service, as well as Felix Leiter of the CIA and Ren√© Mathis of the French Deuxi√®me Bureau. Fleming used his wartime experiences as a member of the Naval Intelligence Division, and the people he met during his work, to provide plot elements; the character of Bond also reflected many of Fleming's personal tastes. Fleming wrote the draft in early 1952 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica while awaiting his marriage. He was initially unsure whether the work was suitable for publication, but was assured by his friend, the novelist William Plomer, that the novel had promise. Within the spy storyline, Casino Royale deals with themes of Britain's position in the world, particularly the relationship with the US in light of the defections to the Soviet Union of the British agents Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean. The book was given broadly positive reviews by critics at the time and sold out in less than a month after its UK release on 13 April 1953, although US sales upon release a year later were much slower. Since publication Casino Royale has appeared as a comic strip in The Daily Express, and been adapted for the screen three times: a 1954 episode of the CBS television series Climax! with Barry Nelson as an American Bond, a 1967 film version with David Niven playing \\"Sir James Bond\\", and a 2006 film in the Eon Productions film series starring Daniel Craig as James Bond. Plot M, the Head of the British Secret Service, assigns James Bond, 007, to play against and bankrupt Le Chiffre, the paymaster for a SMERSH-controlled trade union, in a high-stakes baccarat game at the Royale- les-Eaux casino in northern France. As part of Bond's cover as a rich Jamaican playboy, M also assigns as his companion Vesper Lynd, personal assistant to the Head of Section S (Soviet Union). The CIA and the French Deuxi√®me Bureau also send agents as observers. The game soon turns into an intense confrontation between Le Chiffre and Bond; Le Chiffre wins the first round, cleaning Bond out of his funds. As Bond contemplates the prospect of reporting his failure to M, the CIA agent, Felix Leiter, gives him an envelope of money and a note: \\"Marshall Aid. Thirty-two million francs. With the compliments of the USA.\\" The game continues, despite the attempts of one of Le Chiffre's minders to kill Bond. Bond eventually wins, taking from Le Chiffre eighty million francs belonging to SMERSH. Desperate to recover the money, Le Chiffre kidnaps Lynd and tortures Bond, threatening to kill them both if he does not get the money back. During the torture, a SMERSH assassin enters and kills Le Chiffre as punishment for losing the money. The agent does not kill Bond, saying that he has no orders to do so, but cuts a Cyrillic '–®' for —à–ø–∏–æ–Ω (shpi√≥n, Russian for spy) into Bond's hand so that future SMERSH agents will be able to identify him as such. Lynd visits Bond every day as he recuperates in hospital, and he gradually realises that he loves her; he even contemplates leaving the Secret Service to settle down with her. When he is released from hospital they spend time together at a quiet guest house and eventually become lovers. One day they see a mysterious man named Gettler tracking their movements, which greatly distresses Lynd. The following morning, Bond finds that she has committed suicide. She leaves behind a note explaining that she had been working as an unwilling double agent for the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs. SMERSH had kidnapped her lover, a Polish Royal Air Force pilot, who had revealed information about her under torture; SMERSH then used that information to blackmail her into helping them undermine Bond's mission, including her own faked kidnapping. She had tried to start a new life with Bond, but upon seeing Gettler‚Äîa SMERSH agent‚Äîshe realised that she would never be free of her tormentors, and that staying with Bond would only put him in danger. Bond informs his service of Lynd's duplicity, coldly telling his contact, \\"The bitch is dead now.\\" Background Rear Admiral John Henry Godfrey, Fleming's superior at the Naval Intelligence Division and a basis for the character M Ian Fleming, born in 1908, was a son of Valentine Fleming, a wealthy banker and MP who died in action on the Western Front in May 1917. Educated at Eton, Sandhurst and, briefly, the universities of Munich and Geneva, Fleming moved through several jobs before he was recruited by Rear Admiral John Godfrey, the Director of Naval Intelligence, to become his personal assistant. Fleming joined the organisation full-time in August 1939, with the codename \\"17F\\", and worked for them throughout the war. Early in 1939 he began an affair with Ann O'Neill ( Charteris), who was married to the 3rd Baron O'Neill. In 1942 Fleming attended an Anglo-American intelligence summit in Jamaica and, despite the constant heavy rain during his visit, he decided to live on the island once the war was over. His friend Ivar Bryce helped find a plot of land in Saint Mary Parish where, in 1945, Fleming had a house built, which he named Goldeneye. The name of the house and estate has many possible sources. Fleming mentioned both his wartime Operation Goldeneye and Carson McCullers' 1941 novel Reflections in a Golden Eye, which described the use of British naval bases in the Caribbean by the US Navy. Upon Fleming's demobilisation in May 1945, he became the Foreign Manager in the Kemsley newspaper group, which at the time owned The Sunday Times. In this role he oversaw the paper's worldwide network of correspondents. His contract allowed him to take two months holiday every winter in Jamaica. In 1948 Charteris gave birth to Fleming's daughter, Mary, who was stillborn; Charteris and Fleming became engaged shortly in 1951. Fleming had previously mentioned to friends that he wanted to write a spy novel, but it was not until early 1952, to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials, that he began to write Casino Royale at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica on 17 February; he typed out 2,000 words in the morning, directly from his own experiences and imagination, and finished work on the manuscript in March 1952. It was a pattern he retained for future Bond books. In May 1963 he wrote a piece for Books and Bookmen magazine in which he said: \\"I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day.\\" Back in London, Fleming had his manuscript‚Äîwhich he described as his \\"dreadful oafish opus\\"‚Äîretyped by Joan Howe, his red-haired secretary at The Times on whom the character Miss Moneypenny was partly based. Clare Blanchard, a former girlfriend, advised him not to publish the book, or at least to do so under a pseudonym. During the book's final draft stages, Fleming allowed his friend, and later editor, William Plomer to see a copy, and remarked \\"I really am thoroughly ashamed of it ... after rifling through this muck you will probably never speak to me again, but I have got to take that chance.\\" Despite this, Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house Jonathan Cape. At first they were unenthusiastic, but were persuaded to publish on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother, Peter, an established travel writer whose books they managed. Although Fleming provided no dates within his novels, two writers have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. John Griswold and Henry Chancellor‚Äîboth of whom have written books on behalf of Ian Fleming Publications‚Äîput the events of Casino Royale in 1951; Griswold allows a possible second timeframe and considers the story could have taken place in either May to July 1951, or May to July 1952. DevelopmentPlot inspirations= Casino Royale was inspired by certain incidents that took place during Fleming's wartime career at the Naval Intelligence Division (NID), or by events of which he was aware. On a trip to Portugal, en route to the United States, Fleming and the NID Director, Admiral Godfrey, went to the Estoril Casino. Because of Portugal's neutral status, Estoril's population had been swelled by spies and agents from the warring regimes. Fleming claimed that while there he was cleaned out by a \\"chief German agent\\" at a table playing chemin de fer. Godfrey told a different story: that Fleming only played Portuguese businessmen, and afterwards fantasised about playing against German agents. The failed attempt to kill Bond at Royale-Les-Eaux was inspired by Fleming's knowledge of the attempted assassination of Franz von Papen, Vice-Chancellor of Germany and an ambassador under Hitler. Both Papen and Bond survived their assassination attempts, carried out by Bulgarians, because trees protected them from the blasts. The torture scene in which Bond's genitals are thrashed while he is strapped to a bottomless chair was a version of a French-Moroccan torture technique, ', in which the steel string of a mandolin was used to slice in half the testicles of British wartime agents. Fleming also included four references in the novel to \\"Red Indians\\", including twice on the last page, which came from a unit of commandos, known as No. 30 Commando or 30 Assault Unit (30AU), composed of specialist intelligence troops. The unit was Fleming's idea, and he nicknamed the troops his \\"Red Indians\\", although they disliked the name. =Characters= Hoagy Carmichael: Fleming's view of James Bond The lead character of Casino Royale is James Bond, an agent of the Secret Service. Fleming initially named the character James Secretan before he appropriated the name of James Bond, author of the ornithology guide, Birds of the West Indies. Fleming explained to the ornithologist's wife \\"that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\\". He further explained that \\"When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument ... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [James Bond] is the dullest name I ever heard.\\" Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both the American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself, and in the novel Lynd remarks that \\"Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.\\" According to Andrew Lycett, Fleming's biographer, \\"within the first few pages ... [Fleming] had introduced most of Bond's idiosyncrasies and trademarks\\", which included his looks, his Bentley and his smoking and drinking habits. The full details of Bond's martini were kept until chapter seven of the book and Bond eventually named it \\"The Vesper\\", after Lynd. Bond's order, to be served in a deep champagne goblet, was for \\"three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel.\\" Speaking of Bond's origins, Fleming said that \\"he was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\\", although the author gave many of his own traits to the character. Bond's tastes are often taken from Fleming's own, as is some of his behaviour: Fleming used the casino to introduce Bond in his first novel because \\"skill at gambling and knowledge of how to behave in a casino were seen ... as attributes of a gentleman\\". Lycett sees much of Bond's character as being \\"wish fulfilment\\" by Fleming. Bond's superior, M, was largely based on Godfrey, Fleming's NID superior officer; Godfrey was known for his bellicose and irascible temperament. One of the likely models for Le Chiffre was the influential English occultist, astrologer, mystic and ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley, on whose physical features Fleming based Le Chiffre's. Crowley's tastes, especially in sado-masochism, were also ascribed to Le Chiffre; as Fleming's biographer Henry Chancellor notes, \\"when Le Chiffre goes to work on Bond's testicles with a carpet-beater and a carving knife, the sinister figure of Aleister Crowley is there lurking in the background.\\" Style Fleming later said of his work, \\"while thrillers may not be Literature with a capital L, it is possible to write what I can best describe as 'thrillers designed to be read as literature. He used well-known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism, which the author Kingsley Amis called \\"the Fleming effect\\". Amis describes it as \\"the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond's world ... [is] bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced.\\" Within the text the novelist Raymond Benson‚Äîwho later wrote a series of Bond novels‚Äîidentifies what he described as the \\"Fleming Sweep\\", the use of \\"hooks\\" at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next. The hooks combine with what the novelist Anthony Burgess calls \\"a heightened journalistic style\\" to produce \\"a speed of narrative, which hustles the reader past each danger point of mockery\\". The semiotician and essayist, Umberto Eco, in his 1979 examination of the Bond books, \\"The Narrative Structure of Ian Fleming\\", considered that Fleming \\"has a rhythm, a polish, a certain sensuous feeling for words. That is not to say that Fleming is an artist; yet he writes with art.\\" When examining the passage relating to the death of Le Chiffre, Eco wrote that \\"there is a ... baroque feeling for the image, a total adaptation off the image without emotional comment, and a use of words that designate things with accuracy\\", and he went on to conclude that \\"Fleming is more literate than he gives one to understand.\\" Themes Casino Royale was written after, and was heavily influenced by, the Second World War; Britain was still an imperial power, and the Western and Eastern blocs were engaged in the Cold War. The journalist William Cook observes that with the decline in power of the British Empire, \\"Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight.\\" The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett agree, and consider that \\"Bond embodied the imaginary possibility that England might once again be placed at the centre of world affairs during a period when its world power status was visibly and rapidly declining.\\" In 1953 parts of central London, including Oxford Street and High Holborn still had uncleared bomb sites and sweets had ceased being rationed, but coal and other food items were still regulated. According to The Times journalist and historian Ben Macintyre, Bond was \\"the ideal antidote to Britain's postwar austerity, rationing and the looming premonition of lost power\\". Casino Royale deals with the question of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the real-world central role of the US in the defence of the West. The academic Jeremy Black points to the 1951 defections of two members of MI6‚ÄîGuy Burgess and Donald Maclean‚Äîto the Soviet Union as having a major impact on how Britain was poorly viewed in US intelligence circles; Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, but he did not focus on it too strongly, and Bond and Leiter's warm relationship did not reflect the reality of the US-UK relationship. Amis, in his exploration of Bond in The James Bond Dossier, pointed out that Leiter is \\"such a nonentity as a piece of characterization ... he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly doing better than he\\". The journalist and author Christopher Hitchens observed that \\"the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that, although superficially devoted to the Anglo-American war against communism, they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans\\". David Seed, in his examination of spy fiction, disagrees, and writes that while Bond beats Le Chiffre, his \\"activities are constantly supported by American agencies, financing and know-how\\". The treachery of Le Chiffre, with the overtones of a fifth column, struck a chord with the largely British readership as Communist influence in the trade unions had been an issue in the press and parliament at the time. Britain had also suffered from defections to the Soviet Union from two MI6 operatives who were part of the Cambridge Five spy ring that betrayed Western secrets to the Soviets. Thus Lycett observes that Casino Royale can be seen as Fleming's \\"attempt to reflect the disturbing moral ambiguity of a post-war world that could produce traitors like Burgess and Maclean\\". The journalist and writer Matthew Parker observes that with the defections of the two spies so recent to the publication, it was \\"perhaps the closest Fleming came to a [John] le Carr√©- style spy story\\". Chancellor sees the moral ambiguity of the Cold War reflected in the novel. Benson considers the most obvious theme of the novel to be good versus evil. Parker agrees, and highlights a conversation between Bond and Matthis in the chapter titled \\"The Nature of Evil\\", in which Bond says: \\"By ... [Le Chiffre's] evil existence ... he was creating a norm of badness by which, and by which alone, an opposite norm of goodness could exist.\\" The subject was also dealt with by the academic Beth Butterfield, in an examination of Bond from an existentialist viewpoint. In light of Bond's conversation, Butterfield identifies a crisis of confidence in Bond's character, where he has \\"moved beyond good and evil\\" to the point where he does his job not because of principles, but to pursue personal battles. Eco comes to the same conclusion, stating that Bond \\"abandon[s] the treacherous life of moral mediation and of psychological anger, with all the dangers they entail.\\" Black also identifies a mechanism Fleming uses in Casino Royale‚Äîand in subsequent Bond novels‚Äîwhich is to use the evil of his opponents both as a justification of his actions, and as a device to foil their own plans. Black refers to the episode of the attempted assassination of Bond by Bulgarian assassins which results in their own deaths. Publication and receptionPublication history= Casino Royale was first released on 13 April 1953 in the UK as a hardback edition by publishers Jonathan Cape, with a cover devised by Fleming. Cape printed 4,728 copies of Casino Royale, which sold out in less than a month; a second print run the same month also sold out, as did a third run of more than 8,000 books published in May 1954. The sales figures were strong enough for Cape to offer Fleming a three-book deal. In April 1955 Pan Books issued a paperback version and sold 41,000 copies in the first year. In the US three publishers turned the book down before Macmillan Publishing Co offered Fleming a deal. Casino Royale was published on 23 March 1954 in the US, but sales were poor, totalling only 4,000 copies across the entire US during the course of the year. When the novel was released as a US paperback in 1955, it was re-titled by publisher American Popular Library; Fleming's suggestions for a new title, The Double-O Agent and The Deadly Gamble, were disregarded in favour of You Asked for It, but this marketing ploy failed to raise the interest. The Popular Library version also changed Bond's name, calling him \\"Jimmy Bond\\". =Critical reception= Hugh I'Anson Fausset, writing in The Manchester Guardian, thought that Casino Royale was \\"a first- rate thriller ... with a breathtaking plot\\". Although he considered the book to be \\"schoolboy stuff\\", he felt the novel was \\"galvanised into life by the hard brilliance of the telling\\". Alan Ross, writing in The Times Literary Supplement wrote that Casino Royale was \\"an extremely engaging affair\\", and that \\"the especial charm ... is the high poetry with which he invests the green baize lagoons of the casino tables\\". He concluded that the book was \\"both exciting and extremely civilized\\". Reviewing for The Listener, Simon Raven believed that Fleming was a \\"kind of supersonic John Buchan\\", but he was somewhat dismissive of the plot, observing that it is \\"a brilliant but improbable notion\\" that includes \\"a deal of champagne-drinking, bomb-throwing, relentless pitting of wits etc ... with a cretinous love-affair\\". Raven also dismissed Bond as an \\"infantile\\" creation, but did allow that \\"Fleming tells a good story with strength and distinction ... his creation of a scene, both visually and emotionally, is of a very high order indeed.\\" John Betjeman, writing in The Daily Telegraph, considered that \\"Ian Fleming has discovered the secret of the narrative art ... which is to work up to a climax unrevealed at the end of each chapter. Thus the reader has to go on reading\\". Publishers Jonathan Cape included many of the reviews on their advertisements for the book, which appeared in a number of national newspapers; the reviews included those from The Sunday Times, which concluded that Fleming was \\"the best new English thriller-writer since [Eric] Ambler\\" and The Observer, which advised their readers: \\"don't miss this\\". The critic for Time magazine examined Raymond Chandler's The Long Goodbye alongside Casino Royale; he praised Casino Royale, saying that \\"Fleming keeps his incidents and characters spinning through their paces like juggling balls.\\" The Time reviewer went on to say that \\"As for Bond, he might be [Philip] Marlowe's younger brother except that he never takes coffee for a bracer, just one large Martini laced with vodka.\\" Writing for The New York Times, Anthony Boucher wrote that the book belongs \\"pretty much to the private-eye school\\" of fiction. He praised the first part, saying that Fleming \\"manages to make baccarat clear even to one who's never played it and produced as exciting a gambling sequence as I've ever read. But then he decides to pad out the book to novel length and leads the weary reader through a set of tough clich√©s to an ending which surprises nobody save Operative 007. You should certainly begin this book; but you might as well stop when the baccarat game is over.\\" Adaptations Copyright renewal registration for Casino Royale in the US In 1954 CBS paid Ian Fleming $1,000 to adapt Casino Royale into a one-hour television adventure as part of its Climax! series. The episode aired live on 21 October 1954 and starred Barry Nelson as secret agent \\"Card Sense\\" James 'Jimmy' Bond and Peter Lorre as Le Chiffre. A brief tutorial on baccarat is given at the beginning of the show by the presenter of the programme, William Lundigan, to enable viewers to understand a game which was not popular in America at the time. For this Americanised version of the story, Bond is an American agent, described as working for \\"Combined Intelligence\\", while the character Leiter from the original novel is British, renamed \\"Clarence Leiter\\". The agent for Station S., Mathis, does not appear as such; his surname is given to the leading lady, named Val√©rie Mathis instead of Vesper Lynd. In March 1955 Ian Fleming sold the film rights of Casino Royale to the producer Gregory Ratoff for $6,000. After Ratoff's death, producer Charles K. Feldman represented Ratoff's widow and obtained the rights to make a film version. Feldman decided the best way to profit from the film rights was to make a satirical version, which was produced and released in 1967 by Columbia Pictures. The film, which cast David Niven as Bond, was made with five credited directors (plus one uncredited) and a cast that included Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, Orson Welles and Woody Allen. The 1967 version is described by the British Film Institute as \\"an incoherent all-star comedy\\". Casino Royale was the first James Bond novel to be adapted as a daily comic strip; it was published in The Daily Express and syndicated worldwide. The strip ran from 7 July 1958 to 13 December 1958, and was written by Anthony Hern and illustrated by John McLusky. To aid The Daily Express in illustrating Bond, Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of what he believed James Bond to look like. McLusky felt that Fleming's 007 looked too \\"outdated\\" and \\"pre-war\\" and changed Bond to give him a more masculine look. A graphic novel adaptation of the book was released by Dynamite Entertainment in April 2018, written by Van Jensen and illustrated by Dennis Calero. Following the 1967 adaptation, the rights to the film remained with Columbia Films until 1989 when the studio, and the rights to their intellectual property portfolio was acquired by the Japanese company Sony. In 1999, following legal action between Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM/UA, Sony traded the rights to Casino Royale for MGM's partial-rights to Spider- Man. This led to Eon Productions making the 2006 film Casino Royale. The film stars Daniel Craig as Bond, supported by Eva Green as Vesper Lynd and Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre; Judi Dench returned for her fifth Bond film as Bond's superior, M. Casino Royale is a reboot, showing Bond at the beginning of his career as a 00-agent and overall stays true to the original novel.

His view of human nature and social progress is kindred to Swift's pessimism. He was known as a statesman, historian, writer and philosopher, and was one of the most visible representatives of the nascent Russian conservatism during the second half of the 18th century. M. M. Shcherbatov received a good-formal education. He studied history, philosophy, literature and medicine. Until the end of his life he had a vast collection of 40,000 volumes in his home library. Like all educated people of that time he knew French, and in addition to that, he was also competent in German, Italian and a few other western languages. From 1767 onwards, Shcherbatov was in the public service and held responsible posts. He represented the Yaroslavl nobility at the Nakaz commission (1767), was a member of a private commission of the middle-class people, a member of the Board of Trade (1770), a president of the Chamber Council and a Senator (1779). In 1768 he received the position of historiographer and was appointed a Chief Herald of the Senate. In his view the political ideal was to follow the British example of a constitutional monarchy with separation of powers. He found a certain analogy to this ideal in Pre-Petrian Russia when, in his opinion, autocracy was confined to the use of such aristocratic organ as the Council Boyars. Mikhail's personal view and attitude of Peter I of Russia or Peter the Great (who ruled Russia from 7 May 1682 until his death in 1725) in his writings was quite ambiguous. In one of his drafts \\"An examination of defects and autocracy of Peter the Great\\" (1782), he openly criticized Peter, arguing that what he did for the prosperity of Russia can be done by more humane means, resulting in smaller losses even though it might take a longer period of time. In Shcherbatov's opinion, without foreign borrowing and the autocracy of Peter the Great, significantly much more time would have been needed for the Russian Enlightenment and foreign policy opponents meanwhile could have captured the country. Yet, Shcherbatov was aware that, apart from the personal weaknesses, the roughness and cruelty of the autocrat were caused by the viciousness of the time. Peter was forced by the time to be a despot. Scherbatov's father was a governor-general of Moscow and a Rurikid prince. His belonging to the oldest of Russian families may explain Scherbatov's lifelong interest in the national history. In a series of articles published in 1759-61 he defended serfdom and upheld ancient privileges of nobility which had been repealed by Peter the Great. When elected by the nobility of Yaroslavl to represent their interests at the Legislative Assembly of 1767, Shcherbatov virulently slammed the existing institutions of the Russian Empire. He caught the attention of the Empress and was appointed imperial historian in 1768 and president of a ministry in 1778. He worked in the Senate from 1779 to 1786. Scherbatov's History of Russia from the Earliest Times, of which seven volumes appeared between 1771 and 1791, is imbued with rationalistic ideals of the Age of Reason. He thought that inequality was inherent to human nature and illustrated this tenet in the first Russian utopia, entitled Journey to the Land of Ophyr (1783). Scherbatov's final and probably most lasting work was a scathing attack on the contemporary social customs in the treatise On the Corruption of Morals in Russia, published in 1797.  Shcherbatov as a historian and publicist  In one of his most famous works \\"On the corruption of morals in Russia\\" Shcherbatov criticized the mass abuses committed by the authorities, such as bribery, embezzlement of public funds, servility, etc. There was also criticism of the methods of Peter the Great by which he promoted \\"obscure people\\" and in turn led to a state crisis. Yet, Shcherbatov tried to be unbiased and to show both the positive and negative sides of Peter's modernization. He wrote about changes made in Russia by Peter's reforms, drawing his attention not only to changes in political and military areas, but also in the field of culture, specifying that due to Europeanization, \\"in the matter of personal and certain other matters, one can say we truly enjoyed remarkable success and moved forward with giant steps to correcting how we appear to others\\". After the accession of Catherine II (who reigned as an Empress of Russia from June 28, 1762 until 1796), Shcherbatov participated in the Established Commission (1767‚Äì1771). He supported the elimination of cards on the Table of Ranks and the expansion of the rights of the Russian nobility. However, he was not a pure \\"court\\" ideologist, caring only about \\"narrow interests\\", as some Soviet researchers are inclined to think. In regard to attached serfs who belonged to merchants and worked in their factories, Shcherbatov considered it necessary to have them registered in their places but not allowing any more to be bought. As far as those serfs who were registered at the factories, he proposed to free them little by little, giving them freedom as a reward for good character and excellent knowledge of arts. Shcherbatov stood for the preservation of serfdom, arguing that the peasants, being uneducated, would not be able to properly use their freedom. He also believed that the problems of serfdom could be solved, not by destroying it, but gradually as a result of changes in attitude and treatment of farmers by landlords. Shortly before his death, Shcherbatov created two works, which reflected his views on politics: \\"Various Opinions about Government\\" and \\"General Thoughts about Legislation\\". In those works, he distinguished four forms of government: monarchy, despotism (or autocracy), aristocracy and democracy and considered the monarchic government the most comprehensible. Shcherbatov saw the ideal monarch as the one who esteems himself father of the people, who does not reject legislation to establish autocracy, who does not divide his interests with the interests of the State and who is adept at choosing councillors among people, combining diligence to their sovereign with love for motherland and laws\\". However, the majority of the governors, being subject to various \\"passions\\", could not meet the given characteristics. The aristocratic board was not comprehensible to Russia yet. Failure or unwillingness of people to suppress their excessive ambition, selfishness and lust for power \\"generates divisions, parties, hatred and evil, which in essence were a result of those destructive passions\\". The democratic governments \\"gnaws at its own entrails dividing into various parties, which in various troubled times are tossed like a ship on a stormy sea, often escaping being sunk by the skill of the pilot, but even more often perishing, sometimes even right at the dock\\". Rejecting autocracy as a form of government, Scherbatov wrote \\"yet there is torture, in which there are no other laws and regulations except for the insane self-will of the despot\\". The Russian views on legislation were a result of the practical work of Shcherbatov in various public institutions. Since the establishment of the new laws required a thorough examination of the subject, Shcherbatov believed that \\"laws should be composed by a few impartial people, reasonable, familiar, hardworking and devoted to state affairs \\". Comparing laws in the various forms of government, Shcherbatov pointed out the advantage of the monarchy, which, having its solid established laws could provide for its citizens' security for their lives, property and tranquility. Ideas about the state system received development in Shcherbatov's utopian work \\"A Journey to the Land of Ophyr\\". His main idea was that laws should be based on moral principles and the citizens of the state should honour first virtue, then law, and after that ‚Äì the king and the authorities. Their lives are dependent, in the first place, on their natural freedom, and after that to their civil responsibilities, which do not try to limit the freedom save only to impose certain duties in relation to the society. In this sense, he believed that people should honour and obey the laws; relationships inside society lie on humane principles and respect for each other and for the monarch, wherein a framework may be created for social balance and political peace within the boundaries of the country. In that work, Shcherbatov developed his system for the prosperity and well-being of society, the basis of which lay in the idea that honor and respect for the monarch should not be rooted in any form of egoistic servility or hope of receiving a reward. He also supported the idea of a structure within society that is divided into several hierarchical classes, according to which the life of every citizen is regulated. At the top of the pyramid is the king, who should not be seen as almighty but as \\"the first among equals\\". Then come the landlords and merchants. The lowest is the class of peasants. Although they were not free, the legislation of the utopian state would require that their masters treat them humanely, provide for their needs, respect their work and refrain from harsh punishment. Nowadays Scherbatov's ideas still attract the attention of Russian and foreign researchers of Russian conservatism movement and are fervently discussed in numerous books and articles.

It was the second largest French pharmaceutical company 2nd largest pharmaceutical company (after Rh√¥ne-Poulenc and ahead of Sanofi) before it was acquired by Hoechst AG of Frankfurt, Germany in 1997, with pharmaceutical operations combined into the Hoechst Marion Roussel (HMR) division in the United States. Roussel Uclaf's agrochemical operations had been transferred to Hoechst Schering AgrEvo GmbH in 1994. HMR subsequently merged in 1999 with Rh√¥ne-Poulenc to form Aventis, which then merged in 2004 with Sanofi-Synth√©labo to form Sanofi-Aventis, which was since renamed Sanofi. Hoechst Schering AgrEvo merged in 1999 with Rh√¥ne- Poulenc's agrochemical division to form Aventis CropScience, which was acquired by Bayer AG in 2002 and combined with Bayer's agrochemical division to form Bayer CropScience.  RU-486  In April 1980, as part of a formal research project at Roussel-Uclaf for the development of glucocorticoid receptor antagonists, chemist Georges Teutsch synthesized mifepristone (RU-38486, the 38,486th compound synthesized by Roussel-Uclaf from 1949 to 1980; shortened to RU-486); which was discovered to also be a progesterone receptor antagonist. assigned to Roussel Uclaf In October 1981, endocrinologist √âtienne-√âmile Baulieu, a consultant to Roussel-Uclaf, arranged tests of its use for medical abortion in eleven women in Switzerland by gynecologist Walter Herrmann at the University of Geneva's Cantonal Hospital, with successful results announced on April 19, 1982. On October 9, 1987, following worldwide clinical trials in 20,000 women of mifepristone with a prostaglandin analogue (initially sulprostone or gemeprost, later misoprostol) for medical abortion, Roussel-Uclaf sought approval in France for their use for medical abortion, with approval announced on September 23, 1988. On October 21, 1988, in response to antiabortion protests and concerns of majority (54.5%) owner Hoechst AG of Germany, Roussel-Uclaf‚Äôs executives and board of directors voted 16 to 4 to stop distribution of mifepristone, which they announced on October 26, 1988. Two days later, the French government ordered Roussel-Uclaf to distribute mifepristone in the interests of public health. French Health Minister Claude √âvin explained that: \\"I could not permit the abortion debate to deprive women of a product that represents medical progress. From the moment Government approval for the drug was granted, RU-486 became the moral property of women, not just the property of a drug company.\\" Following use by 34,000 women in France from April 1988 to February 1990 of mifepristone distributed free of charge, Roussel-Uclaf began selling Mifegyne (mifepristone) to hospitals in France in February 1990 at a price (negotiated with the French government) of $48 per 600 mg dose. Mifegyne was subsequently approved in Great Britain on July 1, 1991, and in Sweden in September 1992, but until his retirement in late April 1994, Hoechst AG chairman Wolfgang Hilger, a devout Roman Catholic, blocked any further expansion in availability. On May 16, 1994, Roussel-Uclaf announced that it was donating without remuneration all rights for medical uses of mifepristone in the U.S. to the Population Council, which subsequently licensed mifepristone to Danco Laboratories, a new single-product company immune to antiabortion boycotts, which won FDA approval as Mifeprex on September 28, 2000. On April 8, 1997, after buying the remaining 43.5% of Roussel-Uclaf stock in early 1997, Hoechst AG ($30 billion annual revenue) announced the end of its manufacture and sale of Mifegyne ($3.44 million annual revenue) and the transfer of all rights for medical uses of mifepristone outside of the U.S. to Exelgyn S.A., a new single-product company immune to antiabortion boycotts, whose CEO was former Roussel-Uclaf CEO √âdouard Sakiz. In 1999, Exelgyn won approval of Mifegyne in 11 additional countries, and in 28 more countries over the following decade.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1920 to 1922, and is notable as the only member of the Socialist Party of Canada ever to serve in that institution.http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/armstrong_g.shtml History Armstrong was born in East York, Ontario, and educated in Ellesmere. He trained as a carpenter, and practiced his trade in Winnipeg. Armstrong was a member of the Fair Wage Board for Manitoba. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1910 provincial election, in the constituency of Winnipeg West. At the time, the Socialist Party represented the left-wing of the labour movement in Manitoba, with the reformist Manitoba Labour Party (MLP) representing its moderate voice. Armstrong was known in this period as a leading figure in the SPC's \\"impossibilist\\" wing, opposing any cooperation with moderate labour. In electoral terms, the Socialist Party was a marginal force in the city. Armstrong received 246 votes in Winnipeg West, against 2,578 for the victorious candidate, Liberal Thomas Johnson. In the 1914 provincial election, Armstrong ran in Winnipeg Centre \\"B\\" against Fred Dixon, an independent candidate supported by both the Liberals and the Labour Representation Committee, a successor to the MLP. A Conservative candidate also contested the seat. Armstrong and his supporters disrupted Dixon's rallies throughout the campaign, accusing him of being a \\"fake\\" in his advocacy of working-class causes. Dixon's supporters, in turn, argued that the SPC was receiving help from the Conservatives to split the labour vote. Armstrong finished a distant third with 928 votes, while Dixon received 8,205 votes for a convincing victory. Armstrong ran against Dixon again in the 1915 election, and again lost by a significant margin. Winnipeg General Strike The Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 brought Armstrong and the SPC into cooperation with the city's labour movement. Along with other prominent labour organizers in the city, Armstrong was brought to trial after the strike's suppression on charges of seditious conspiracy. He was convicted, and spent almost two years in prison with fellow strikers such as William Ivens and John Queen. Many observers at the time, and many since, have regarded the charges against the strikers as unjust and politically motivated. Even as the Socialist Party was declining in the rest of the country, the spirit of labour unity generated by the strike and the arrests brought the SPC in Winnipeg into a temporary alliance with the city's other labour parties. Armstrong, previously an opponent of \\"popular front\\" strategies, became the SPC's star candidate on Winnipeg's united labour list for the 1920 provincial election. Election For this election, following a change in the province's electoral laws, Winnipeg became a single constituency which elected ten members to the legislature by a single transferable ballot. Labour and the SPC joined with two other parties for a slate of ten candidates, and ran a united campaign. Armstrong, still serving his prison sentence, finished third on the first count and was declared elected to the city's eighth position on the final count. He served in the legislature with the labour group under F. J. Dixon's leadership. Despite their philosophical differences, Dixon and Armstrong were able to cooperate with one another in this period. The Socialist Party of Canada split in 1921, with many of its members joining the newly formed Communist Party. Armstrong remained a member of the SPC, even though the party was having difficulty maintaining a national presence by this time. During the 1922 provincial election, Armstrong was frequently heckled by Communist candidates who accused him of being a \\"sell out\\" to the social gospellers in the mainstream labour movement. He finished ninth on the first count, but fell behind on transfers and failed to win a seat. The SPC ceased to exist a few years later, and Armstrong withdrew from provincial politics for a time. Socialist Party of Canada (WSM) Armstrong ran for the Manitoba legislature again in the 1932 provincial election as the candidate of the Socialist Party of Canada (WSM). He was unsuccessful, finishing nineteenth on the first count and being eliminated on the tenth. Armstrong was also a popular figure in his carpenter's union, even though his views were to left most other members. In his later years, he relocated from Manitoba to California.

A motion picture, television and stage actor in Los Angeles and New York in the 1950s, his friends including James Dean and Marilyn Monroe, Gilmore has also written about his encounter with Elizabeth Short a.k.a. \\"The Black Dahlia\\" during his youth. Gilmore emerged as a writer from the Beat Generation in the '60s, influenced by Jack Kerouac and befriended by author William S. Burroughs. The publication of his true crime book \\"Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia,\\" ushered in a cult following for the author. His manuscripts and original writings are housed in the special collections department of the Research Library of the University of California at Los Angeles.  Biography  John Gilmore was born in the Charity Ward of the Los Angeles County General Hospital and was raised in Hollywood. His mother had been a studio contract-player for MGM while his step-grandfather worked as head carpenter for RKO Pictures. Gilmore's parents separated when he was six months old and he was subsequently raised by his grandmother. Gilmore's father became a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, and also wrote and acted on radio shows, a police public service (the shows featured promising movie starlets as well as established performers like Bonita Granville, Ann Rutherford, the \\"jungle girl\\" Acquanetta, Joan Davis, Hillary Brooke, Ann Jeffreys, Brenda Marshall and other players young John Gilmore became acquainted with. As a child actor, he appeared in a Gene Autry movie and bit parts at Republic Studios. He worked in LAPD safety films and did stints on radio. Eventually he appeared in commercial films. Actors Ida Lupino and John Hodiak were mentors to Gilmore, who worked in numerous television shows and feature films at Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox, and Universal International studios. During the 1950s, through John Hodiak, Gilmore sustained an acquaintanceship with Marilyn Monroe in Hollywood,Michelle Morgan, Marilyn Monroe: Private and Undisclosed\\" 2007 then in New York City, where Gilmore was involved with the Actors Studio, transcribing the lectures of Lee Strasberg into book form. Gilmore performed on stage and in live TV, wrote poetry and screenplays, and directed two experimental plays, one by Jean Genet. He wrote and directed a low-budget film entitled \\"Expressions,\\" later changed to \\"Blues for Benny.\\" The film did not get a general release but was shown independently. After five years in which he wrote a dozen motion picture scripts and developed film projects with director Curtis Harrington, Gilmore eventually settled into a literary career as a journalist, true crime writer and novelist. He served as head of the writing program at Antioch University and has taught and lectured at length.Gale Group, Inc. Contemporary Authors; Volume 180, 2000. = Acting and writing careers = John Gilmore starring with Susan Oliver in \\"Run to the City\\". Directed by Stuart Rosenberg Gilmore's acting career consisted mainly of guest spots on many of the most popular shows of the time such as Bonanza and Naked City, but it was his offscreen exploits which made him a familiar face to audiences. While Gilmore was living in New York City in the spring of 1953, a mutual friend, movie bit-player and extra, Ray Curry, introduced him to actor James Dean.John Gilmore The Real James Dean 1976 Gilmore and Dean developed a friendshipPaul Alexander Boulevard of Broken Dreams 1997 along with TV director James Sheldon, Eartha Kitt, and Broadway director, John Stix. After Gilmore returned to Hollywood, the friendship with James DeanJoe Hyams, James Dean: Little Boy Lost 1994 was renewed, Eartha Kitt sometimes making it a trio in riding motorcycles along Sunset Boulevard.Eartha Kitt, Alone With Me: A New Autobiography 1976 Gilmore and Dean also rode their motorcycles along Pacific Coast Highway, often at speeds in excess of the posted limits.Lee Raskin, James Dean: At Speed 2005 As a select group of friends in leather jackets, hanging out nights at Googie's on Sunset, next door to Schwab's Drugstore, Dean, Gilmore and others were referred to as the \\"Night Watch,\\" as reported in The Hollywood Reporter during April, 1955, and the Hollywood Citizen News during May, 1955, at the time Dean was starring in the film, Rebel Without a Cause. In his first book on Dean, The Real James Dean, published in 1975, Gilmore caused considerable controversy when he stated that their friendship involved an experimentation with homosexuality. In 1997, Gilmore wrote a second, more detailed book on his relationship with James Dean, entitled Live Fast, Die Young: Remembering the Short Life of James Dean. Author Donald Spoto interviewed Gilmore about Dean for his bio Rebel: The Life and Legend of James Dean,Donald Spoto, Rebel: The Life and Legend of James Dean 1996 as other authors, i.e. Joe Hyams, Val Holley, Paul Alexander, Liz Sheridan had interviewed Gilmore previously.John Gilmore, Live Fast, Die Young: Remembering the Short Life of James Dean 1998 After writing a series of action-oriented \\"pulp sleaze\\" novels in 1962-63 for Lou Kimzey's France Books in North Hollywood (under the pseudonyms Sol Tabor, Neil Egri and Mort Gillian), in 1970 Gilmore published The Tucson Murders, through Dial Press, New York, a hardcover nonfiction true crime detailing the life and crimes of Charles Schmid, the \\"notorious pied piper of Tucson\\".John Gilmore, Tucson Murders 1970 Following this, Gilmore published his second nonfiction, The Garbage People, a hardcover exploration into the lives of Charles Manson and the Family. A few years before the so-called Manson Murders, and while an actor, Gilmore met actress Sharon Tate at 20th Century Fox studios.John Gilmore, The Garbage People 1998 Writing on his Website about Sal Mineo, Gilmore says of Dean's other co-stars in Rebel Without A Cause that Dean avoided both Nick Adams and Natalie Wood and that \\"once off the set, he went out of his way to go in the opposite direction.\\" Also a friend of another Rebel co-star, Dennis Hopper, Gilmore hung out with him in Hollywood and in New York City. In the late 1950s, John Gilmore spent time in Paris, France, frequented the Beat Hotel, sustained friendships with novelist Fran√ßoise Sagan and movie star Brigitte Bardot. He met William S. Burroughs and wrote a novel that was opted by Henry Miller's publisher, Maurice Girodias of Olympia Press. However, the novel was not published due to financial troubles related to Olympia Press. Girodias later started a publishing company in New York: Girodias Press, and with the encouragement of William Burroughs, Gilmore's novel was again set to go to press, this time under the title \\"Passenger of Satan.\\" Again the company folded. The book was later published by Creation Books in the UK, under the original title, \\"Fetish Blonde\\". Gilmore says, \\"The novel underwent a number of changes in those decades but the guts remained the same.\\" In 1971, Gilmore published his first account of '60s cult leader and convicted murderer, Charles Manson titled The Garbage People. Modestly successful, it gained a much larger audience through a 1996 re-release, and like most of Gilmore's books, remains in print. = Later life = In 1994, Gilmore wrote a book that chronicled the famous Black Dahlia unsolved homicide. Occurring in 1947, at a time when his father was on the police force, Gilmore's book Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder earned him wide recognition. According to the Publishers Weekly review, in the book \\"Gilmore presents evidence that strengthens the LAPD's case against chief suspect Jack Wilson, a reclusive, alcoholic burglar and possible serial killer\\".John Douglas, Mark Olshaker The Cases That Haunt Us 2000 Marilyn Manson, who made paintings based on photos from the book, said: \\"Severed is my favorite book... John Gilmore is my favorite writer. It has been my desire to direct Severed as a movie ... my directorial debut ...\\". The motion picture rights to Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder had been under option by Edward Pressman Films for six years, during which time David Lynch was brought in to direct. Due to disagreements in the approach to the subject, despite having developed a script, the deal with David Lynch dissolved. Chris Hanley was then producing Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder, for Edward Pressman Films, with Floria Sigismondi involved as director. Colin Wilson says of Gilmore's Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder: \\"The best book on the Black Dahlia--in fact, the only reliable book.\\"John Gilmore, Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder 1994 John Gilmore's second 1996 release received praise from the New York Times Book Review for his story on the life and crimes of multiple murderer, Charles Schmid. In 1997, in \\"Laid Bare\\", his first book of memoirs, Gilmore recounts his associations beginning in the 1950s and through the 1960s with Hank Williams, Janis Joplin, Jack Nicholson, Jane Fonda, Dennis Hopper, Brigitte Bardot, Jean Seberg, Steve McQueen, Irish McCalla, Jayne Mansfield, Ed Wood, and other personalities.John Gilmore, Laid Bare: A Memoir of Wrecked Lives and The Hollywood Death Trip 1997 = Death = John Gilmore died on October 13, 2016. He is survived by his son Carson Gilmore (a professional classical musician and published author), and a daughter, Ursula Gilmore, an artist, journalist and businesswoman. = Legacy = Married and divorced three times, John Gilmore is survived by two children, son Carson Gilmore and daughter Ursula Gilmore. He lived in the Hollywood Hills. He was frequently interviewed in the media by the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times as well as other international publications, and documentaries, and was described as a noir cult figure, a \\"cultural icon,\\" with numerous books always in the works. He was and continues to be published worldwide. In 2007 Gilmore completed an in- depth memoir, \\"a personal journey,\\" Gilmore says, into the short life of Marilyn Monroe: Inside Marilyn Monroe.

Wight wrote a series of semi- autobiographical books under the pen name James Herriot, with Brian and Donald Sinclair appearing in fictionalised form as brothers Tristan and Siegfried Farnon. Sinclair worked for his brother while studying veterinary medicine until he graduated from the Royal (Dick) Veterinary College in Edinburgh in 1943, subsequently joining the Royal Army Veterinary Corps in India. On demobilisation, he joined the Ministry of Agriculture's Sterility Advisory unit, rising to become head of the Veterinary Investigation Centre in Leeds. He was the model for the character Tristan Farnon in Wight's semi- autobiographical novels which were adapted in two films and television under the name All Creatures Great and Small. Tristan was portrayed as a charming rogue who was still studying veterinary medicine in the early books, constantly having to re-take examinations because of his lack of application, often found in the pub, and provoking tirades from his bombastic elder brother Siegfried. Sinclair made no objections to Wight's portrayal of him, and seemed rather to enjoy the celebrity, appearing on television and lecturing at veterinary schools all over the UK and elsewhere. Sinclair married Sheila Rose Seaton in 1944, and they had three daughters.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on April 25, 1999. The episode features Peter after he is placed under house arrest, and decides to open his own bar in the family's basement. The bar immediately becomes a success among Peter's male friends when his wife, Lois, begins to sing and dance in front of them while wearing revealing clothing. Meanwhile, Stewie attempts to create a time travel device in order to escape the pain of teething. The episode was written by Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan and directed by Roy Allen Smith, all series firsts. Much of the episode's humor is structured around cutaway sequences that parody popular culture, including those centered on The Chronicles of Narnia, Sesame Street, Homicide: Life on the Street, Mentos, and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. The title \\"Mind Over Murder\\" was inspired by 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology Suspense, which featured several elements pertaining to death and murder. The episode featured performances by guest stars Carlos Alazraqui, Butch Hartman, Alex Rocco, Leslie Uggams and Wally Wingert, along with several recurring voice actors for the series. The episode received praise from IGN television critic Ahsan Haque for its storyline and use of cultural references. Plot Stewie is in terrible pain from teething and cannot find comfort anywhere. When his mother Lois tells him that his pain will ultimately pass, it gives him the idea to build a machine that will move time forward to the point where his teething will have already stopped. Meanwhile, Lois tells Peter to drive their son Chris to his soccer match, then come right back to look after Stewie. However, Peter's friend Quagmire is there, and has brought beer, so Peter decides to ignore Lois and stay at the game. While there, another member of the crowd insults Chris. Enraged, Peter punches this person in the face, only to discover that it is a pregnant woman who looks and sounds like a man. Peter is put under house arrest for assault and soon begins to miss his friends. Peter has a vision of the Pawtucket Patriot, a fictional ale mascot, from his ale can label and on his advice opens a bar in his basement so that his friends can come to visit. The basement bar soon becomes a local hotspot. Lois is upset about this, until she gets a chance to sing on stage before an appreciative crowd. As she savors the spotlight over the next few days, Peter becomes increasingly uncomfortable with the attention she is getting, especially from the male patrons. Peter demands that she quit singing, but she refuses. Peter is soon cornered by the neglected wives of his bar's patrons, and invites them to drag their husbands out from his bar. Meanwhile, Stewie‚Äôs time machine plans are accidentally discovered by Lois, who shows them around to the bar's patrons. Angered and upset that his plans have been discovered, Stewie runs upstairs. Soon after, the wives storm the bar and Lois tells them that she only wants to feel appreciated and special, something to which all the other women relate. Meanwhile, Quagmire accidentally starts a fire. Upstairs, Stewie takes drastic measures to protect his plans, programming the machine to go back in time before he drew them up. In the bar, Peter and Lois have a heart-to-heart conversation, and they do not immediately notice that the bar is burning. When they try to escape, the stairs become blocked and they are trapped. Stewie reverses time just as Peter is having an epiphany about how poorly he treats Lois, and seconds before the basement bar goes up in flames. They all travel back in time, to when Lois asked Peter to take Chris to the game. While he is getting ready, Peter trips on Stewie's time machine, destroying it and injuring his leg, thus preventing him from taking Chris to his soccer match, while Stewie is left to suffer with more teething pain. Production Butch Hartman guest starred in this episode. \\"Mind Over Murder\\" was written by Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan and directed by Roy Allen Smith, all of whom made their series debut with this episode. Peter Shin, who has since supervised other episodes of the show, acted as supervising director. Writer Andrew Gormley and voice actor Mike Henry acted as staff writers in this episode, while Ricky Blitt and Chris Sheridan worked as the story editors. In addition to the regular cast, the episode featured the voices of actors Leslie Uggams, Wally Wingert, Alex Rocco and Carlos Alazraqui. Recurring guest voice actors included actress Lori Alan and writer and animator Butch Hartman. The title \\"Mind Over Murder\\", like the titles of the first three episodes of the season, was inspired by 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology Suspense, which featured several elements pertaining to death and murder. This convention was dropped in the fifth episode of the season, \\"A Hero Sits Next Door\\", partly to make the episodes easier to distinguish by their titles.Callaghan, p. 32 Cultural references When Lois confronts Peter about the mess he is making in their house, he says he is terrible at housework. From this comes a cutaway which shows Peter doing the laundry. When he climbs into the machine in search of a missing sock, he falls into a wintry world where he encounters Mr. Tumnus from The Chronicles of Narnia. While Peter is under house arrest he states that he is becoming bored of everything in the house including the television shows, which he feels have blended together. A cutaway features Bert and Ernie from the children's television series Sesame Street, in a mix with the crime drama Homicide: Life on the Street. When the Griffin family is watching television they see a commercial for Mentos-brand mints, which features the American stage actor John Wilkes Booth as he attempts to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. When Stewie starts to feel pain around the inside of his mouth, Lois notices and states that he is teething. Stewie quickly responds by asking her to kill him, or to shake him like a British nanny, a reference to the Louise Woodward case. Reception In his 2008 flashback review, Ahsan Haque of IGN praised the episode, rating it a 9/10, praising the \\"integration between the random jokes and the storyline\\", in comparison to later episodes. He criticized the \\"one-dimensional\\" nature of Stewie's character, but was impressed by the amount of story featured in this half-hour episode. In another article, Haque named Stewie's time machine plan from \\"Mind Over Murder\\" number five in his list of \\"Stewie's Top 10 Most Diabolical Evil Plans\\". Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave the episode a mixed review, with a 55%. rating. Pierson praised the episode's plot, the handling of Peter and Stewie, and some of the cutaways. He criticized the relationship between Lois and Peter as unconvincing. At the end of his review he stated, \\"Family Guy doesn‚Äôt seem to have found the right balance yet between silliness and seriousness. So far its plots have been either irrelevant or emotionally unappealing.

Masaryk, the linguist Jan Gebauer and the historian Josef Goll, with whom he collaborated on Otto's encyclopedia. After 1893 he taught maths on various high schools and met with J. J. Friƒç, a manufacturer of precision instruments. In 1898 Friƒç bought a large piece of land in Ond≈ôejov, 50 km south-east from Prague, where they established an astronomical observatory. Since 1904 Nu≈°l was assistant professor of astronomy at the Charles University of Prague and after 1908 professor of mathematics at the Czech Technical University in Prague (ƒåVUT). In 1917, Nu≈°l was among the founders of the Czech Astronomical Society, whose president he was to become later. In 1928 Friƒç dedicated the well-equipped Ond≈ôejov Observatory to the Charles university and to the Czechoslovak state and Nu≈°l became its first head. He was a member and temporarily vice-chairman of the International Astronomical Union and participated in establishing the popular ≈†tef√°nik's Observatory on the Pet≈ô√≠n hill in Prague. Nu≈°l was a gifted musician, he played viola and was member of a Prague chorus. He was married and had three children.  Work  Nu≈°l was a very gifted experimenter, particularly interested in geometrical optics and in geodetical instruments. His circumzenithal, jointly developed with Friƒç, was an ingenious portable instrument used to precisely determine geodetical coordinates. The method was based on the properties of mercury horizon and allowed to establish local coordinates with an error about 10 m, surpassed only much later by satellite navigation. To reduce the error caused by the observer, Nu≈°l developed an \\"impersonal micrometer\\": instead of pushing a button in the moment of the passage of a star, the observer set up the instrument to follow exactly the movement of the star and the moment of the passage has been signalled automatically. Awards and honors * Since 1999, the Franti≈°ek Nu≈°l Award has been given by the Czech Astronomical Society as a lifetime achievement award. * Asteroid 3424 Nu≈°l was named for him. * The crater Nu≈°l on the Moon is named after him. * The astronomical observatory in his native town Jind≈ôich≈Øv Hradec bears his name.

Gameplay Title screen of Super Famicom Wars Players take control of one of two warring nations, Red Star and Blue Moon, as they seek to establish turn-based dominance over each other. After selecting which stage to start the game and setting which, if either, player will be controlled by a person, the Red Star army is given the first turn. The objective in each stage is to either conquer the enemy's headquarters or destroy all remaining enemy units in one turn. During each turn, the player is given a certain amount of funds which can be used to build units in factories, seaports, and airports in their command, as well as cities near their headquarters. Each unit has their own specialty and abilities, with ten land units (including two foot soldier units), four air units, and two sea units. Some units use firepower against the enemy, while others provide support to allies. Only foot soldier units are capable of conquering cities, which are used to repair or refuel damaged units and gain more funds. There are 15 maps available at the start of the game, with two secret ending maps dependent on the player's nation when playing against the computer.

Growth Gentiana lutea is an herbaceous perennial plant, growing to tall, with broad lanceolate to elliptic leaves long and broad. The flowers are yellow, with the corolla separated nearly to the base into 5‚Äì7 narrow petals. It grows in grassy alpine and sub- alpine pastures, usually on calcareous soils. Uses Gentiana lutea is remarkable for the intense bitterness of the root and every part of the herbage. Before the introduction of hops, gentian was used occasionally in brewing. Gentiana lutea Gentian root has a long history of use as an herbal bitter and is an ingredient of many proprietary medicines. The parts used include the dried, underground parts of the plant and the fresh, above-ground parts. The root, which can be over thick and has few branches, is harvested in the autumn and dried for later use. Caution should be exercised as to its use because it is endangered, and the closely related Centaurium erythraea shares many of its constituents and actions. The name is a tribute to Gentius, an Illyrian king who was thoughtA manual of the flowering plants of California by Willis Linn Jepson to have found out that the herb had tonic properties.

The original music score is composed by Steve Dorff. The film generated a total domestic gross of $13,110,903. It received a \\"two thumbs up\\" rating from Siskel and Ebert. The film is an open parody of the beach party films made popular in the 1960s, especially those in which Avalon and Funicello had appeared. The plot is merely the means of connecting the various sight gags, homages and in-jokes. All character names are taken from those earlier films. The film's soundtrack included covers of several well-known beach tunes, along with new songs by such artists as Aimee Mann and Private Domain. Plot Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello are a husband and wife living in Ohio ‚Äî far from the surf and sand of their earlier lives together. Frankie is a stressed out car salesman and former \\"Big Kahuna\\" of the surf scene in California while Annette bottles her own sense of angst up in a bevy of shopping. Together they are raising a son, Bobby, who is in the throes of rebellion against his seemingly square folks. One day, the family decides to take a vacation to Hawaii. Deciding to stop in California to visit their daughter Sandi (Lori Loughlin), Frankie and Annette are appalled to learn that she has been making time with surfer Michael (Tommy Hinkley) throughout her time there. The family misses their flight to Hawaii, and ultimately end up staying in California, much to the chagrin of Frankie. Frankie and Annette get caught up with the lives of their old friends and their old beach, and thus their last beach adventure begins. Along the way, Frankie must work together with a new generation of younger surfers while nearly ruining his marriage by dallying with Connie Stevens ‚Äî one of several pop-culture icons appearing in the film, including Fishbone, Don Adams, Bob Denver, Alan Hale Jr., Edd Byrnes, Jerry Mathers, Tony Dow, Barbara Billingsley, Dick Dale, Stevie Ray Vaughan, O. J. Simpson, and Pee-wee Herman. In the end The Big Kahuna overcomes his own fears and proves that he is still the king of the surfers, as he takes back his title and saves the beach from a gang of beach punks led by Zed (Joe Holland). Soundtrack The soundtrack for this film was released in 1987 on CBS Records (CK-40892). Track listing (key performers in parentheses): # \\"Catch a Ride\\" (Eddie Money) # \\"Pipeline\\" (Stevie Ray Vaughan & Dick Dale) (This track also appears on the Stevie Ray Vaughan album Solos, Sessions & Encores, and on King of the Surf Guitar: The Best of Dick Dale & The Del-Tones (Rhino 1989).) # \\"Sign of Love\\" ('Til Tuesday & Aimee Mann) # \\"Absolute Perfection\\" (Private Domain) # \\"Surfin' Bird\\" (Pee-wee Herman) # \\"Sun, Sun, Sun, Sun, Sun\\" (Marti Jones) # \\"Jamaica Ska\\" (Funicello & Fishbone) # \\"Wipe Out\\" (Herbie Hancock with Dweezil Zappa and Terry Bozzio) # \\"California Sun\\" (Avalon) # \\"Wooly Bully\\" (Dave Edmunds) Two other songs, \\"We'll Go on Forever\\", sung by the cast, and \\"I Hate You\\" (from Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home) are not included on the album.

He hired several screenwriters and shopped the screenplay around town. Paramount was attracted to the project but did not like the script. Because Orion Pictures owned the rights to the original AIP \\"beach party movies\\", Paramount wanted to make (in the words of one spokesperson) \\"an entirely original screenplay not based on any prior beach movies. It parodies all beach movies.\\" Writer-director James Komack shared the same agent as Avalon; when he became attached Paramount agreed to finance. Komack stated: > I met with Ned Tanen (Paramount's production chief) and we agreed it would > be about a middle-age marital life crisis which, through a series of happy > events, allows the couple to recapture their youth and renew the > relationship. Eventually, they wanted a picture I couldn't deliver. They > wanted to camp it up and I felt it wasn't necessary. Eventually Paramount hired Lyndall Hobbs to direct; she had never made a feature before but had directed numerous music videos. Various writers were hired, seventeen in all, including Jeff Buhia & Steve Zacharias, Robert Kaufman, David Obst and Bill Norton Jr. This cost an estimated $2 million in writer's fees. Funicello called it her favourite filmmaking experience since Babes in Toyland. However it was during the making of the movie she first started developing symptoms of MS.Funicello p 188-190 Proposed sequel In her memoirs Funicello wrote that she and Avalon were preparing a sequel where their characters go on safari in Africa, but that her illness meant she pulled out.

In 2007, a railway link to Laos was proposed from H√† Tƒ©nh province.  Economy  H√† Tƒ©nh is among the poorest provinces of Vietnam with a GDP in 2008 of US$420 per capita. The poverty can be attributed to the harsh natural conditions with severe cold in winter and extreme heat in summer, floods and storms every autumn and unfavorable soil and natural resources. A badly-operated district and provincial government is also a hurdle to prosperity. Agriculture, forestry and fishery takes up 35.5 percent of total GDP and the province's GDP accounts for 0.7 percent of Vietnam's GDP. H√† Tƒ©nh has taken slow steps in economic reforms though better signs in recent times are incentive.

Country music singer Waylon Jennings, who died three months after the episode aired on television in the United States, guest-stars in his last ever appearance on the show. Dakota Fanning also guest starred on the episode. The title is a reference to a line in the traditional Southern song \\"Dixie\\". The episode was written by future showrunner Steve Callaghan, and was directed by Dan Povenmire. It features the first appearance of the recurring character John Herbert, an elderly pedophile with a perpetual lust for Peter and Lois' teenage son Chris Griffin. Plot Needing extra money, Chris decides to get a newspaper route, to help pay for a birthday gift for a girl he likes. Among those on his paper route is an old man named Herbert who is sexually attracted to Chris. Chris later gives his crush a present, but his clumsiness and over-eagerness scares her off. Nevertheless, he decides to retain the paper route. Shortly thereafter, however, Chris witnesses a robbery at a convenience store, and his bike ends up being stolen by the burglar as a getaway vehicle (even though he takes the bike but runs on foot). Later, at the police station, Chris identifies the thief from a police lineup. However, Peter shows up and tells the thief (unknowingly) that he is here to pick up Chris who was going to \\"finger the guy who held up the convenience store\\" and then proceeds to give the thief a picture of Chris, along with various other personal information. When the thief escapes and swears vengeance on Chris, the family is placed in the Witness Protection Program where they are relocated to Bumblescum, a tiny town in the deep South, to which Meg complains, although Lois remains somewhat optimistic. Deciding to embrace the South, Peter decorates his car like the General Lee, though he fails to roll the passenger window down for Brian when beckoning him to enter. He then becomes sheriff with Brian as his deputy, although the two neglect their responsibilities in order to drink. Stewie joins a hillbilly jug band, Meg becomes the most successful and popular student among her classmates (besting Oinky the Pig), and Chris makes a new friend named Sam. Later, when Peter interferes with a Civil War reenactment, claiming the North won the war, despite how they were being portrayed in the play, Sam's dad says Chris and Sam can no longer be friends and Peter and Brian have to answer to the civil war survivors. Not knowing of this, Sam unexpectedly kisses Chris, and Chris assumes Sam is gay. As Chris writes in a journal about what happened with Sam, Brian hears the story (as Chris was speaking out what he wrote), and he explains that kissing Sam seemingly felt right. When the two meet again, Chris explains to Sam that even though he is flattered that Sam likes him, he is not interested in a romantic relationship and feels that they are probably better off as just friends. Just before the two go swimming, Chris finds out that Sam is a girl, and due to his bad experiences around girls, Chris now feels awkward around Sam. At a party that is held that night, Sam explains to Chris that he had no problem talking to her, when he thought she was a guy, so she tells Chris to think of her as a boy who he can make out with. After the FBI agents who were hired to look over the Griffins home in Quahog accidentally reveal the location of the family (telling the criminal where Meg was, but not Chris), the criminal tracks the family down in Bumblescum, and attempts to kill Chris. During the confrontation, however, the criminal is shot and killed by Sam's father. With the criminal gone, the Griffins return to Quahog with Chris having to leave Sam behind. Once they are home, they realize that someone had left 113 messages on their answering machine, all of which turn out to be from Herbert, who is looking for Chris. Production Steve Callaghan wrote the episode. Dan Povenmire, who directed the episode, was granted substantial creative freedom by series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane.

I trust you.\\" Povenmire praised this management style for letting him \\"have fun.\\" Povenmire brought realism, and material from his own experiences, to the visual direction of Family Guy.Callaghan, pp. 174Callaghan, pp. 142 For this episode,Callaghan, pp. 171 Povenmire drew inspiration from his own childhood in the deep south for a sequence for a background scene where a \\"redneck\\" character nonchalantly kicks a corpse into the nearby river. Also, there was a running gag of raccoons jumping out of things and scratching Peter in the face. In addition to the regular cast, actors Brian Dunkleman and Kathleen Wilhoite, voice actors Dakota Fanning, Ralph Garman, and Rachael MacFarlane, and singer Waylon Jennings, guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors and writers Mike Henry and Danny Smith made minor appearances. References ;General * Callaghan, Steve (2005). Family Guy: The Official Episode Guide Seasons 1‚Äì3.

Friedrich Paulsen (; July 16, 1846 ‚Äì August 14, 1908) was a German Neo-Kantian philosopher and educator. Biography He was born at Langenhorn (Schleswig) and educated at the Gymnasium Christianeum, the University of Erlangen, and the University of Berlin. He completed his doctoral thesis under Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg at Berlin in 1871, he habilitated there in 1875, and he became extraordinary professor of philosophy and pedagogy there in 1878. In 1896 he succeeded Eduard Zeller as professor of moral philosophy at Berlin. He was the greatest of the pupils of Gustav Theodor Fechner, to whose doctrine of panpsychism he gave great prominence by his Einleitung in die Philosophie (1892; 7th ed., 1900; Eng. trans., 1895). He went, however, considerably beyond Fechner in attempting to give an epistemological account of the knowledge of the psychophysical. Admitting Immanuel Kant's hypothesis that by inner sense we are conscious of mental states only, he holds that this consciousness constitutes a knowledge of the thing-in-itself which Kant denies. Soul is, therefore, a practical reality which Paulsen, with Arthur Schopenhauer, regards as known by the act of will. But this will is neither rational desire, unconscious irrational will, nor conscious intelligent will, but an instinct, a will to live (Zielstrebigkeit), often subconscious, pursuing ends, indeed, but without reasoning as to means. This conception of will, though consistent and convenient to the main thesis, must be rigidly distinguished from the ordinary significance of will, i.e. rational desire.Concerning will, he did influence namely his student and later friend, the German founder of sociology, Ferdinand T√∂nnies. Paulsen is almost better known for his educational writings than as a pure philosopher, including his German Education, Past and Present (Eng. trans., by I. Lorenz, 1907).

Schutz: Tools, Weapons and Ornaments: Germanic Material Culture in Pre-Carolingian Central Europe, 400-750. BRILL, 2001, p.42. Later the term was associated with Romanized Germanic dynasties within the collapsing Western Roman Empire, who eventually commanded the whole region between the rivers Loire and Rhine. They imposed power over many other post-Roman kingdoms and Germanic peoples. Still later, Frankish rulers were given recognition by the Catholic Church as successors to the old rulers of the Western Roman Empire. Although the Frankish name does not appear until the 3rd century, at least some of the original Frankish tribes had long been known to the Romans under their own names, both as allies providing soldiers, and as enemies. The new name first appears when the Romans and their allies were losing control of the Rhine region. The Franks were first reported as working together to raid Roman territory. However, from the beginning the Franks also suffered attacks upon them from outside their frontier area, by the Saxons, for example, and as frontier tribes they desired to move into Roman territory, with which they had had centuries of close contact. The Germanic tribes which formed the Frankish federation in Late Antiquity are associated with the Weser-Rhine Germanic/Istvaeonic cultural-linguistic grouping.R.L.

Frankish peoples inside Rome's frontier on the Rhine river included the Salian Franks who from their first appearance were permitted to live in Roman territory, and the Ripuarian or Rhineland Franks who, after many attempts, eventually conquered the Roman frontier city of Cologne and took control of the left bank of the Rhine. Later, in a period of factional conflict in the 450s and 460s, Childeric I, a Frank, was one of several military leaders commanding Roman forces with various ethnic affiliations in Roman Gaul (roughly modern France). Childeric and his son Clovis I faced competition from the Roman Aegidius as competitor for the \\"kingship\\" of the Franks associated with the Roman Loire forces. (According to Gregory of Tours, Aegidius held the kingship of the Franks for 8 years while Childeric was in exile.) This new type of kingship, perhaps inspired by Alaric I, represents the start of the Merovingian dynasty, which succeeded in conquering most of Gaul in the 6th century, as well as establishing its leadership over all the Frankish kingdoms on the Rhine frontier. It was on the basis of this Merovingian empire that the resurgent Carolingians eventually came to be seen as the new Emperors of Western Europe in 800. In the High and Late Middle Ages, Western Europeans shared their allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church and worked as allies in the Crusades beyond Europe in the Levant. In 1099, the crusader population of Jerusalem mostly comprised French settlers who, at the time, were still referred to as Franks, and other Europeans such as Spaniards, Germans and Hungarians. French knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the two-hundred-year span of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs uniformly continued to refer to the crusaders and West Europeans as Franjƒ´ caring little whether they really came from France. The French Crusaders also imported the French language into the Levant, making French the base of the lingua franca (litt. \\"Frankish language\\") of the Crusader states. This has had a lasting impact on names for Western Europeans in many languages. Western Europe is known alternatively as \\"Frangistan\\" to the Persians. From the beginning the Frankish kingdoms were politically and legally divided between an eastern more Germanic part, and the western part that the Merovingians had founded on Roman soil. The eastern \\"Frankish\\" part came to be known as the new \\"Holy Roman Empire\\", and was from early times occasionally called \\"Germany\\". Within \\"Frankish\\" Western Europe itself, it was the original Merovingian or \\"Salian\\" Western Frankish kingdom, founded in Roman Gaul and speaking Romance languages, which has continued until today to be referred to as \\"France\\" ‚Äì a name derived directly from the Franks.  Etymology  A 19th century depiction of different Franks (AD 400‚Äì600) The name was not a tribal name, but within a few centuries it had eclipsed the names of the original peoples who constituted them. Following the precedents of Edward Gibbon and Jacob Grimm,. the name of the Franks has been linked with the English adjective \\"frank\\", originally meaning \\"free\\".Examples: And so on. There have also been proposals that Frank comes from the Germanic word for \\"javelin\\" (such as in Old English or Old Norse ).Robert K. Barnhart, ed. Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology (Bronx, NY: H. W. Wilson, 1988), 406. Words in other Germanic languages meaning \\"fierce\\", \\"bold\\" or \\"insolent\\" (German , Middle Dutch , Old English and Old Norwegian ), may also be significant. Eumenius addressed the Franks in the matter of the execution of Frankish prisoners in the circus at Trier by Constantine I in 306 and certain other measures:Panegyric on Constantine, xi.. (\\"Where now is that ferocity of yours? Where is that ever untrustworthy fickleness?\\"). was used often to describe the Franks.. Contemporary definitions of Frankish ethnicity vary both by period and point of view. A formulary written by Marculf about 700 AD described a continuation of national identities within a mixed population when it stated that \\"all the peoples who dwell [in the official's province], Franks, Romans, Burgundians and those of other nations, live ... according to their law and their custom.\\". Writing in 2009, Professor Christopher Wickham pointed out that \\"the word 'Frankish' quickly ceased to have an exclusive ethnic connotation. North of the River Loire everyone seems to have been considered a Frank by the mid-7th century at the latest [except Bretons]; Romani [Romans] were essentially the inhabitants of Aquitaine after that\\".  Mythological origins  Apart from the History of the Franks by Gregory of Tours, two early sources relate the mythological origin of the Franks: a 7th-century work known as the Chronicle of Fredegar and the anonymous , written a century later. The author of the Chronicle of Fredegar claimed that the Franks came originally from Troy and quoted the works of Virgil and Hieronymous: According to historian Patrick J. Geary, those two mythological stories are \\"alike in betraying both the fact that the Franks knew little about their background and that they may have felt some inferiority in comparison with other peoples of antiquity who possessed an ancient name and glorious tradition. (...) Both legends are of course equally fabulous for, even more than most barbarian peoples, the Franks possessed no common history, ancestry, or tradition of a heroic age of migration. Like their Alemannic neighbours, they were by the sixth century a fairly recent creation, a coalition of Rhenish tribal groups who long maintained separate identities and institutions.\\" The other work, the , previously known as before its republication in 1888 by Bruno Krusch,Krusch, Bruno (ed.) Liber Historicae Francorum. Mon. Germ. Hist., Script. Rer. Meroving. II, 215-238, Hanover, 1888. See also :fr:Liber Historiae Francorum described how 12,000 Trojans, led by Priam and Antenor, sailed from Troy to the River Don in Russia and on to Pannonia, which is on the River Danube, settling near the Sea of Azov. There they founded a city called Sicambria. (The Sicambri were the most well-known tribe in the Frankish homeland in the time of the early Roman empire, still remembered though defeated and dispersed long before the Frankish name appeared.) The Trojans joined the Roman army in accomplishing the task of driving their enemies into the marshes of M√¶otis, for which they received the name of Franks (meaning \\"savage\\"). A decade later the Romans killed Priam and drove away Marcomer and Sunno, the sons of Priam and Antenor, and the other Franks.  History  Early history = The major primary sources on the early Franks include the , Ammianus Marcellinus, Claudian, Zosimus, Sidonius Apollinaris and Gregory of Tours. The Franks are first mentioned in the Augustan History, a collection of biographies of the Roman emperors. None of these sources present a detailed list of which tribes or parts of tribes became Frankish, or concerning the politics and history, but to quote : :A Roman marching-song joyfully recorded in a fourth-century source, is associated with the 260s; but the Franks' first appearance in a contemporary source was in 289. [...] The Chamavi were mentioned as a Frankish people as early as 289, the Bructeri from 307, the Chattuarri from 306‚Äì315, the Salii or Salians from 357, and the Amsivarii and Tubantes from c. 364‚Äì375. In 288 the emperor Maximian defeated the Salian Franks, Chamavi, Frisians and other Germanic people living along the Rhine and moved them to Germania inferior to provide manpower and prevent the settlement of other Germanic tribes.Williams, 50‚Äì51.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 7. In 292 Constantius, the father of Constantine I defeated the Franks who had settled at the mouth of the Rhine. These were moved to the nearby region of Toxandria. Eumenius mentions Constantius as having \\"killed, expelled, captured [and] kidnapped\\" the Franks who had settled there and others who had crossed the Rhine, using the term for the first time. It seems likely that the term Frank in this first period had a broader meaning, sometimes including coastal Frisians. The Franks were described in Roman texts both as allies () and enemies (). About the year 260 one group of Franks penetrated as far as Tarragona in present-day Spain, where they plagued the region for about a decade before they were subdued and expelled by the Romans. In 287 or 288, the Roman Caesar Maximian forced a Frankish leader Genobaud and his people to surrender without a fight. Maximian then forced the Salians in Toxandria (the present Low Countries) to accept imperial authority, but was not able to follow on this success by reconquering Britain. The Life of Aurelian, which was possibly written by Vopiscus, mentions that in 328, Frankish raiders were captured by the 6th Legion stationed at Mainz. As a result of this incident, 700 Franks were killed and 300 were sold into slavery.As the 6th Gallicana is only known from this work, its existence is sometimes questioned along with the genuineness of the work; the question remains unanswered, however: . Frankish incursions over the Rhine became so frequent that the Romans began to settle the Franks on their borders in order to control them. The Franks are mentioned in the , an atlas of Roman roads. It is a 13th-century copy of a 4th or 5th century document that reflects information from the 3rd century. The Romans knew the shape of Europe, but their knowledge is not evident from the map, which was only a practical guide to the roads to be followed from point to point. In the middle Rhine region of the map, the word Francia is close to a misspelling of Bructeri. Beyond Mainz is Suevia, the country of the Suebi, and beyond that is Alamannia, the country of the Alamanni. Four tribes at the mouth of the Rhine are depicted: the Chauci, the Amsivarii ('Ems dwellers'), the Cherusci and the Chamavi, followed by ('who are also Franks'). This implies that the Chamavi were considered Franks. The was probably based on the , a map of twenty years' labour commissioned by Augustus and then kept by the Roman's treasury department for the assessment of taxes. It did not survive as such. Information about the imperial divisions of Gaul probably derives from it. Detail of the Tabula Peutingeriana, showing Francia at the top = Salians = The Salians were first mentioned by Ammianus Marcellinus, who described Julian's defeat of \\"the first Franks of all, those whom custom has called the Salians,\\" in 358., XVII.8.The Latin, is slightly ambiguous, resulting in an interpretation \\"first of all he proceeded against the Franks ...\\" with \\"first\\" presented improperly as an adjective instead of an adverb. As it stands, the Salians are the first Franks of all; if an adverb is intended, the Franks are they who are the Salians. Julian allowed the Franks to remain in Texuandria as within the Empire, having moved there from the Rhine-Maas delta.. The 5th century lists a group of soldiers as . Some decades later, Franks in the same region, possibly the Salians, controlled the River Scheldt and were disrupting transport links to Britain in the English Channel. Although Roman forces managed to pacify them, they failed to expel the Franks, who continued to be feared as pirates. The Salians are generally seen as the predecessors of the Franks who pushed southwestwards into what is now modern France, who eventually came to be ruled by the Merovingians (see below). This is because when the Merovingian dynasty published the Salian law (Lex Salica) it applied in the Neustrian area from the river Liger (Loire) to the Silva Carbonaria, the western kingdom founded by them outside the original area of Frankish settlement. In the 5th century Franks under Chlodio pushed into Roman lands in and beyond the \\"Silva Carbonaria\\" or \\"Charcoal forest\\", which ran through the area of modern western Wallonia. The forest was the boundary of the original Salian territories to the north and the more Romanized area to the south in the Roman province of Belgica Secunda (roughly equivalent to what Julius Caesar had long ago called \\"Belgium\\"). Chlodio conquered Tournai, Artois, Cambrai, and as far as the Somme river. Chlodio is often seen as an ancestor of the future Merovingian dynasty. Childeric I, who according to Gregory of Tours was a reputed descendant of Chlodio, was later seen as administrative ruler over Roman Belgica Secunda and possibly other areas.Gregory of Tours was apparently skeptical of Childeric's connection to Chlodio, and only says that some say there was such a connection. Concerning Belgica Secunda, which Chlodio had conquered first for the Franks, Bishop Remigius, the leader of the church in the same province, stated in a letter to Childeric's son Clovis that \\"Great news has reached us that you have taken up the administration of Belgica Secunda. It is no surprise that you have begun to be as your parents ever were.\\" (Epistolae Austriacae, translated by AC Murray, and quoted in Murray's \\"From Roman to Merovingian Gaul\\" p. 260). This is normally interpreted to mean that Childeric also had this administration. (See for example Wood \\"The Merovingian Kingdoms\\" p. 41.) Both the passage of Gregory and the letter of Remigius note the nobility of Clovis's mother when discussing his connection to this area. Records of Childeric show him to have been active together with Roman forces in the Loire region, quite far to the south. His descendants came to rule Roman Gaul all the way to there, and this became the Frankish kingdom of Neustria, the basis of what would become medieval France. Childeric's son Clovis I also took control of the more independent Frankish kingdoms east of the Silva Carbonaria and Belgica II. This later became the Frankish kingdom of Austrasia, where the early legal code was referred to as \\"Ripuarian\\". = Ripuarians = Approximate location of the original Frankish tribes in the 3rd century The Rhineland Franks who lived near the stretch of the Rhine from roughly Mainz to Duisburg, the region of the city of Cologne, are often considered separately from the Salians, and sometimes in modern texts referred to as Ripuarian Franks. The Ravenna Cosmography suggests that Francia Renensis included the old civitas of the Ubii, in Germania II (Germania Inferior), but also the northern part of Germania I (Germania Superior), including Mainz. Like the Salians they appear in Roman records both as raiders and as contributors to military units. Unlike the Salii, there is no record of when, if ever, the empire officially accepted their residence within the empire. They eventually succeeded to hold the city of Cologne, and at some point seem to have acquired the name Ripuarians, which may have meant \\"river people\\". In any case a Merovingian legal code was called the Lex Ribuaria, but it probably applied in all the older Frankish lands, including the original Salian areas. Jordanes, in Getica mentions the Riparii as auxiliaries of Flavius Aetius during the Battle of Ch√¢lons in 451: Paragraph 191. But these (\\"river dwellers\\") are today not considered to be Ripuarian Franks, but a known military unit based on the river Rhone.Nonn \\"Die Franken\\", p. 85: \\"Heute d√ºrfte feststehen, dass es sich dabei um r√∂mische Einheiten handelt; die in der Gallia riparensis, einem Milit√§rbezirk im Rh√¥negebiet, stationiert waren, der in der Notitia dignitatum bezeugt ist.\\" Their territory on both sides of the Rhine became a central part of Merovingian Austrasia, which stretched to include Roman Germania Inferior (later Germania Secunda, which included the original Salian and Ripuarian lands, and roughly equates to medieval Lower Lotharingia) as well as Gallia Belgica Prima (late Roman \\"Belgium\\", roughly medieval Upper Lotharingia), and lands on the east bank of the Rhine. = Merovingian kingdom (481‚Äì751) = A 6th‚Äì7th century necklace of glass and ceramic beads with a central amethyst bead. Similar necklaces have been found in the graves of Frankish women in the Rhineland. fibula found in north-eastern France and the Rhineland. They were worn by Frankish noblewomen in pairs at the shoulder or as belt ornaments. Gregory of Tours (Book II) reported that small Frankish kingdoms existed during the fifth century around Cologne, Tournai, Cambrai and elsewhere. The kingdom of the Merovingians eventually came to dominate the others, possibly because of its association with Roman power structures in northern Gaul, which the Frankish military forces were apparently integrated into to some extent. Aegidius, was originally the of northern Gaul appointed by Majorian, but after Majorian's death apparently seen as a Roman rebel who relied on Frankish forces. Gregory of Tours reported that Childeric I was exiled for 8 years while Aegidius held the title of \\"King of the Franks\\". Eventually Childeric returned and took the same title. Aegidius died in 464 or 465. Childeric and his son Clovis I were both described as rulers of the Roman Province of , by its spiritual leader in the time of Clovis, Saint Remigius. Clovis later defeated the son of Aegidius, Syagrius, in 486 or 487 and then had the Frankish king Chararic imprisoned and executed. A few years later, he killed Ragnachar, the Frankish king of Cambrai, and his brothers. After conquering the Kingdom of Soissons and expelling the Visigoths from southern Gaul at the Battle of Vouill√©, he established Frankish hegemony over most of Gaul, excluding Burgundy, Provence and Brittany, which were eventually absorbed by his successors. By the 490s, he had conquered all the Frankish kingdoms to the west of the River Maas except for the Ripuarian Franks and was in a position to make the city of Paris his capital. He became the first king of all Franks in 509, after he had conquered Cologne. Clovis I divided his realm between his four sons, who united to defeat Burgundy in 534. Internecine feuding occurred during the reigns of the brothers Sigebert I and Chilperic I, which was largely fuelled by the rivalry of their queens, Brunhilda and Fredegunda, and which continued during the reigns of their sons and their grandsons. Three distinct subkingdoms emerged: Austrasia, Neustria and Burgundy, each of which developed independently and sought to exert influence over the others. The influence of the Arnulfing clan of Austrasia ensured that the political centre of gravity in the kingdom gradually shifted eastwards to the Rhineland. The Frankish realm was reunited in 613 by Chlothar II, the son of Chilperic, who granted his nobles the Edict of Paris in an effort to reduce corruption and reassert his authority. Following the military successes of his son and successor Dagobert I, royal authority rapidly declined under a series of kings, traditionally known as les rois fain√©ants. After the Battle of Tertry in 687, each mayor of the palace, who had formerly been the king's chief household official, effectively held power until in 751, with the approval of the Pope and the nobility, Pepin the Short deposed the last Merovingian king Childeric III and had himself crowned. This inaugurated a new dynasty, the Carolingians. = Carolingian empire (751‚Äì843) = The unification achieved by the Merovingians ensured the continuation of what has become known as the Carolingian Renaissance. The Carolingian Empire was beset by internecine warfare, but the combination of Frankish rule and Roman Christianity ensured that it was fundamentally united. Frankish government and culture depended very much upon each ruler and his aims and so each region of the empire developed differently. Although a ruler's aims depended upon the political alliances of his family, the leading families of Francia shared the same basic beliefs and ideas of government, which had both Roman and Germanic roots. The Frankish state consolidated its hold over the majority of western Europe by the end of the 8th century, developing into the Carolingian Empire. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire. As such, the Carolingian Empire gradually came to be seen in the West as a continuation of the ancient Roman Empire. This empire would give rise to several successor states, including France, the Holy Roman Empire and Burgundy, though the Frankish identity remained most closely identified with France. After the death of Charlemagne, his only adult surviving son became Emperor and King Louis the Pious. Following Louis the Pious's death, however, according to Frankish culture and law that demanded equality among all living male adult heirs, the Frankish Empire was now split between Louis' three sons.  Military  Participation in the Roman army = Germanic peoples, including those tribes in the Rhine delta that later became the Franks, are known to have served in the Roman army since the days of Julius Caesar. After the Roman administration collapsed in Gaul in the 260s, the armies under the Germanic Batavian Postumus revolted and proclaimed him emperor and then restored order. From then on, Germanic soldiers in the Roman army, most notably Franks, were promoted from the ranks. A few decades later, the Menapian Carausius created a Batavian‚ÄìBritish rump state on Roman soil that was supported by Frankish soldiers and raiders. Frankish soldiers such as Magnentius, Silvanus and Arbitio held command positions in the Roman army during the mid 4th century. From the narrative of Ammianus Marcellinus it is evident that both Frankish and Alamannic tribal armies were organised along Roman lines. After the invasion of Chlodio, the Roman armies at the Rhine border became a Frankish \\"franchise\\" and Franks were known to levy Roman-like troops that were supported by a Roman-like armour and weapons industry. This lasted at least until the days of the scholar Procopius (c. 500 ‚Äì c. 565), more than a century after the demise of the Western Roman Empire, who wrote describing the former Arborychoi, having merged with the Franks, retaining their legionary organization in the style of their forefathers during Roman times. The Franks under the Merovingians melded Germanic custom with Romanised organisation and several important tactical innovations. Before their conquest of Gaul, the Franks fought primarily as a tribe, unless they were part of a Roman military unit fighting in conjunction with other imperial units. = Military practices of the early Franks = The primary sources for Frankish military custom and armament are Ammianus Marcellinus, Agathias and Procopius, the latter two Eastern Roman historians writing about Frankish intervention in the Gothic War. Writing of 539, Procopius says: > At this time the Franks, hearing that both the Goths and Romans had suffered > severely by the war ... forgetting for the moment their oaths and treaties > ... (for this nation in matters of trust is the most treacherous in the > world), they straightway gathered to the number of one hundred thousand > under the leadership of Theudebert I and marched into Italy: they had a > small body of cavalry about their leader, and these were the only ones armed > with spears, while all the rest were foot soldiers having neither bows nor > spears, but each man carried a sword and shield and one axe. Now the iron > head of this weapon was thick and exceedingly sharp on both sides, while the > wooden handle was very short. And they are accustomed always to throw these > axes at a signal in the first charge and thus to shatter the shields of the > enemy and kill the men.Procopius HW, VI, xxv, 1ff, quoted in Bachrach > (1970), 436. His contemporary, Agathias, who based his own writings upon the tropes laid down by Procopius, says: > The military equipment of this people [the Franks] is very simple ... They > do not know the use of the coat of mail or greaves and the majority leave > the head uncovered, only a few wear the helmet. They have their chests bare > and backs naked to the loins, they cover their thighs with either leather or > linen. They do not serve on horseback except in very rare cases. Fighting on > foot is both habitual and a national custom and they are proficient in this. > At the hip they wear a sword and on the left side their shield is attached. > They have neither bows nor slings, no missile weapons except the double > edged axe and the angon which they use most often. The angons are spears > which are neither very short nor very long. They can be used, if necessary, > for throwing like a javelin, and also in hand to hand combat.Agathias, > Hist., II, 5, quoted in Bachrach (1970), 436‚Äì437. While the above quotations have been used as a statement of the military practices of the Frankish nation in the 6th century and have even been extrapolated to the entire period preceding Charles Martel's reforms (early mid-8th century), post-Second World War historiography has emphasised the inherited Roman characteristics of the Frankish military from the date of the beginning of the conquest of Gaul. The Byzantine authors present several contradictions and difficulties. Procopius denies the Franks the use of the spear while Agathias makes it one of their primary weapons. They agree that the Franks were primarily infantrymen, threw axes and carried a sword and shield. Both writers also contradict the authority of Gallic authors of the same general time period (Sidonius Apollinaris and Gregory of Tours) and the archaeological evidence. The , the early 7th century legal code of the Rhineland or Ripuarian Franks, specifies the values of various goods when paying a wergild in kind; whereas a spear and shield were worth only two , a sword and scabbard were valued at seven, a helmet at six, and a \\"metal tunic\\" at twelve.James, Edward, The Franks. Oxford; Blackwell 1988, p. 211 Scramasaxes and arrowheads are numerous in Frankish graves even though the Byzantine historians do not assign them to the Franks. The frontispiece of Gregory's The evidence of Gregory and of the implies that the early Franks were a cavalry people. In fact, some modern historians have hypothesised that the Franks possessed so numerous a body of horses that they could use them to plough fields and thus were agriculturally technologically advanced over their neighbours. The specifies that a mare's value was the same as that of an ox or of a shield and spear, two and a stallion seven or the same as a sword and scabbard, which suggests that horses were relatively common. Perhaps the Byzantine writers considered the Frankish horse to be insignificant relative to the Greek cavalry, which is probably accurate.Bachrach (1970), 440. = Merovingian military = Composition and development  The Frankish military establishment incorporated many of the pre-existing Roman institutions in Gaul, especially during and after the conquests of Clovis I in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. Frankish military strategy revolved around the holding and taking of fortified centres () and in general these centres were held by garrisons of or , who were former Roman mercenaries of Germanic origin. Throughout Gaul, the descendants of Roman soldiers continued to wear their uniforms and perform their ceremonial duties. Immediately beneath the Frankish king in the military hierarchy were the , his sworn followers, who were generally 'old soldiers' in service away from court.Halsall, Guy. Warfare and Society in the Barbarian West, 450‚Äì900 (London: Routledge, 2003), p. 48 The king had an elite bodyguard called the truste. Members of the truste often served in , garrison settlements that were established for military and police purposes. The day-to-day bodyguard of the king was made up of antrustiones (senior soldiers who were aristocrats in military service) and (junior soldiers and not aristocrats).Halsall, pp. 48‚Äì49 All high-ranking men had pueri. The Frankish military was not composed solely of Franks and Gallo-Romans, but also contained Saxons, Alans, Taifals and Alemanni. After the conquest of Burgundy (534), the well-organised military institutions of that kingdom were integrated into the Frankish realm. Chief among these was the standing army under the command of the Patrician of Burgundy. In the late 6th century, during the wars instigated by Fredegund and Brunhilda, the Merovingian monarchs introduced a new element into their militaries: the local levy. A levy consisted of all the able-bodied men of a district who were required to report for military service when called upon, similar to conscription. The local levy applied only to a city and its environs. Initially only in certain cities in western Gaul, in Neustria and Aquitaine, did the kings possess the right or power to call up the levy. The commanders of the local levies were always different from the commanders of the urban garrisons. Often the former were commanded by the counts of the districts. A much rarer occurrence was the general levy, which applied to the entire kingdom and included peasants ( and ). General levies could also be made within the still-pagan trans-Rhenish stem duchies on the orders of a monarch. The Saxons, Alemanni and Thuringii all had the institution of the levy and the Frankish monarchs could depend upon their levies until the mid-7th century, when the stem dukes began to sever their ties to the monarchy. Radulf of Thuringia called up the levy for a war against Sigebert III in 640. Soon the local levy spread to Austrasia and the less Romanised regions of Gaul. On an intermediate level, the kings began calling up territorial levies from the regions of Austrasia (which did not have major cities of Roman origin). All the forms of the levy gradually disappeared, however, in the course of the 7th century after the reign of Dagobert I. Under the so-called , the levies disappeared by mid-century in Austrasia and later in Burgundy and Neustria. Only in Aquitaine, which was fast becoming independent of the central Frankish monarchy, did complex military institutions persist into the 8th century. In the final half of the 7th century and first half of the 8th in Merovingian Gaul, the chief military actors became the lay and ecclesiastical magnates with their bands of armed followers called retainers. The other aspects of the Merovingian military, mostly Roman in origin or innovations of powerful kings, disappeared from the scene by the 8th century.  Strategy, tactics and equipment  Merovingian armies used coats of mail, helmets, shields, lances, swords, bows and arrows and war horses. The armament of private armies resembled those of the Gallo-Roman of the late Empire. A strong element of Alanic cavalry settled in Armorica influenced the fighting style of the Bretons down into the 12th century. Local urban levies could be reasonably well-armed and even mounted, but the more general levies were composed of and , who were mostly farmers by trade and carried ineffective weapons, such as farming implements. The peoples east of the Rhine ‚Äì Franks, Saxons and even Wends ‚Äì who were sometimes called upon to serve, wore rudimentary armour and carried weapons such as spears and axes. Few of these men were mounted. Merovingian society had a militarised nature. The Franks called annual meetings every Marchfeld (1 March), when the king and his nobles assembled in large open fields and determined their targets for the next campaigning season. The meetings were a show of strength on behalf of the monarch and a way for him to retain loyalty among his troops.Halsall, p. 43 In their civil wars, the Merovingian kings concentrated on the holding of fortified places and the use of siege engines. In wars waged against external foes, the objective was typically the acquisition of booty or the enforcement of tribute. Only in the lands beyond the Rhine did the Merovingians seek to extend political control over their neighbours. Tactically, the Merovingians borrowed heavily from the Romans, especially regarding siege warfare. Their battle tactics were highly flexible and were designed to meet the specific circumstances of a battle. The tactic of subterfuge was employed endlessly. Cavalry formed a large segment of an army , but troops readily dismounted to fight on foot. The Merovingians were capable of raising naval forces: the naval campaign waged against the Danes by Theuderic I in 515 involved ocean-worthy ships and rivercraft were used on the Loire, Rh√¥ne and Rhine.  Culture  Language = In a modern linguistic context, the language of the early Franks is variously called \\"Old Frankish\\" or \\"Old Franconian\\" and refers to the West Germanic dialects of the Franks prior to the advent of the Second Germanic consonant shift, which took place between 600 and 700. After this consonant shift the Frankish dialect diverges, with the dialects that would become modern Dutch not undergoing the consonantal shift, while all others did so to varying degrees and thereby became part of the larger German dialectal domain. The Frankish language has not been directly attested, apart from a very small number of runic inscriptions found within contemporary Frankish territory such as the Bergakker inscription. The distinction between Old Dutch and Old Frankish is largely negligible, with Old Dutch (also called Old Low Franconian) being the term used to differentiate between the affected and non-affected variants following the aforementioned Second Germanic consonant shift.B. Mees, The Bergakker inscription and the beginnings of Dutch, in: Amsterdamer beitr√§ge zur √§lteren Germanistik: Band 56 ‚Äì 2002, edited by Erika Langbroek, Annelies Roeleveld, Paula Vermeyden, Arend Quak, Published by Rodopi, 2002, A significant amount of Old Frankish vocabulary has been reconstructed by examining early Germanic loanwords found in Old French as well as through comparative reconstruction through Dutch. The influence of Old Frankish on contemporary Gallo-Roman vocabulary and phonology, have long been questions of scholarly debate.. Frankish influence is thought to include the designations of the four cardinal directions: nord \\"north\\", sud \\"south\\", est \\"east\\" and ouest \\"west\\" and at least an additional 1000 stem words. Although the Franks would eventually conquer all of Gaul, speakers of Old Franconian apparently expanded in sufficient numbers only into northern Gaul to have a linguistic effect. For several centuries, northern Gaul was a bilingual territory (Vulgar Latin and Franconian). The language used in writing, in government and by the Church was Latin. Urban T. Holmes has proposed that a Germanic language continued to be spoken as a second tongue by public officials in western Austrasia and Northern Neustria as late as the 850s, and that it completely disappeared as a spoken language during the 10th century from regions where only French is spoken today.U. T. Holmes, A. H. Schutz (1938), A History of the French Language, p. 29, Biblo & Tannen Publishers, = Art and architecture = A chalice from the Treasure of Gourdon. Palatine chapel at Aachen, Germany. Early Frankish art and architecture belongs to a phase known as Migration Period art, which has left very few remains. The later period is called Carolingian art, or, especially in architecture, pre- Romanesque. Very little Merovingian architecture has been preserved. The earliest churches seem to have been timber-built, with larger examples being of a basilica type. The most completely surviving example, a baptistery in Poitiers, is a building with three apses of a Gallo-Roman style. A number of small baptistries can be seen in Southern France: as these fell out of fashion, they were not updated and have subsequently survived as they were. Jewelry (such as brooches), weapons (including swords with decorative hilts) and clothing (such as capes and sandals) have been found in a number of grave sites. The grave of Queen Aregund, discovered in 1959, and the Treasure of Gourdon, which was deposited soon after 524, are notable examples. The few Merovingian illuminated manuscripts that have survived, such as the Gelasian Sacramentary, contain a great deal of zoomorphic representations. Such Frankish objects show a greater use of the style and motifs of Late Antiquity and a lesser degree of skill and sophistication in design and manufacture than comparable works from the British Isles. So little has survived, however, that the best quality of work from this period may not be represented.Otto P√§cht, Book Illumination in the Middle Ages (trans fr German), 1986, Harvey Miller Publishers, London, The objects produced by the main centres of the Carolingian Renaissance, which represent a transformation from that of the earlier period, have survived in far greater quantity. The arts were lavishly funded and encouraged by Charlemagne, using imported artists where necessary, and Carolingian developments were decisive for the future course of Western art. Carolingian illuminated manuscripts and ivory plaques, which have survived in reasonable numbers, approached those of Constantinople in quality. The main surviving monument of Carolingian architecture is the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, which is an impressive and confident adaptation of San Vitale, Ravenna ‚Äì from where some of the pillars were brought. Many other important buildings existed, such as the monasteries of Centula or St Gall, or the old Cologne Cathedral, since rebuilt. These large structures and complexes made frequent use of towers.Eduard Syndicus; Early Christian Art; pp. 164‚Äì174; Burns & Oates, London, 1962  Religion  A sizeable portion of the Frankish aristocracy quickly followed Clovis in converting to Christianity (the Frankish church of the Merovingians). The conversion of all under Frankish rule required a considerable amount of time and effort. = Paganism = Drawing of golden bees or flies that was discovered in the tomb of Childeric I Echoes of Frankish paganism can be found in the primary sources, but their meaning is not always clear. Interpretations by modern scholars differ greatly, but it is likely that Frankish paganism shared most of the characteristics of other varieties of Germanic paganism. The mythology of the Franks was probably a form of Germanic polytheism. It was highly ritualistic. Many daily activities centred around the multiple deities, chiefest of which may have been the Quinotaur, a water-god from whom the Merovingians were reputed to have derived their ancestry.Schutz, 152. Most of their gods were linked with local cult centres and their sacred character and power were associated with specific regions, outside of which they were neither worshipped nor feared. Most of the gods were \\"worldly\\", possessing form and having connections with specific objects, in contrast to the God of Christianity.Gregory of Tours, in his History of the Franks, relates: \\"Now this people seems to have always been addicted to heathen worship, and they did not know God, but made themselves images of the woods and the waters, of birds and beasts and of the other elements as well. They were wont to worship these as God and to offer sacrifice to them.\\" (Gregory of Tours, History of the Franks, Book I.10) Frankish paganism has been observed in the burial site of Childeric I, where the king's body was found covered in a cloth decorated with numerous bees. There is a likely connection with the bees to the traditional Frankish weapon, the angon (meaning \\"sting\\"), from its distinctive spearhead. It is possible that the fleur-de-lis is derived from the angon. = Christianity = Statue in the Basilica of Saint-Remi depicting the baptism of Clovis I by Saint Remi in around 496 Some Franks, like the 4th century usurper Silvanus, converted early to Christianity. In 496, Clovis I, who had married a Burgundian Catholic named Clotilda in 493, was baptised by Saint Remi after a decisive victory over the Alemanni at the Battle of Tolbiac. According to Gregory of Tours, over three thousand of his soldiers were baptised with him. Clovis' conversion had a profound effect on the course of European history, for at the time the Franks were the only major Christianised Germanic tribe without a predominantly Arian aristocracy and this led to a naturally amicable relationship between the Catholic Church and the increasingly powerful Franks. Although many of the Frankish aristocracy quickly followed Clovis in converting to Christianity, the conversion of all his subjects was only achieved after considerable effort and, in some regions, a period of over two centuries.S√∂nke Lorenz (2001), in , Stuttgart: Theiss; ; pp. 441‚Äì446 The Chronicle of St. Denis relates that, following Clovis' conversion, a number of pagans who were unhappy with this turn of events rallied around Ragnachar, who had played an important role in Clovis' initial rise to power. Although the text remains unclear as to the precise pretext, Clovis had Ragnachar executed.The Chronicle of St. Denis, I.18‚Äì19, 23 Remaining pockets of resistance were overcome region by region, primarily due to the work of an expanding network of monasteries.Lorenz (2001:442) Gelasian Sacramentary, c. 750 The Merovingian Church was shaped by both internal and external forces. It had to come to terms with an established Gallo-Roman hierarchy that resisted changes to its culture, Christianise pagan sensibilities and suppress their expression, provide a new theological basis for Merovingian forms of kingship deeply rooted in pagan Germanic tradition and accommodate Irish and Anglo- Saxon missionary activities and papal requirements.J.M. Wallace-Hadrill covers these areas in The Frankish Church (Oxford History of the Christian Church; Oxford:Clarendon Press) 1983. The Carolingian reformation of monasticism and church-state relations was the culmination of the Frankish Church. The increasingly wealthy Merovingian elite endowed many monasteries, including that of the Irish missionary Columbanus. The 5th, 6th and 7th centuries saw two major waves of hermitism in the Frankish world, which led to legislation requiring that all monks and hermits follow the Rule of St Benedict.Michel Rouche, 435‚Äì436. The Church sometimes had an uneasy relationship with the Merovingian kings, whose claim to rule depended on a mystique of royal descent and who tended to revert to the polygamy of their pagan ancestors. Rome encouraged the Franks to slowly replace the Gallican Rite with the Roman rite. When the mayors took over, the Church was supportive and an Emperor crowned by the Pope was much more to their liking.  Laws  As with other Germanic peoples, the laws of the Franks were memorised by \\"rachimburgs\\", who were analogous to the lawspeakers of Scandinavia.Michel Rouch, 421. By the 6th century, when these laws first appeared in written form, two basic legal subdivisions existed: Salian Franks were subject to Salic law and Ripuarian Franks to Ripuarian law. Gallo-Romans south of the River Loire and the clergy remained subject to traditional Roman law.Michel Rouche, 421‚Äì422. Germanic law was overwhelmingly concerned with the protection of individuals and less concerned with protecting the interests of the state. According to Michel Rouche, \\"Frankish judges devoted as much care to a case involving the theft of a dog as Roman judges did to cases involving the fiscal responsibility of , or municipal councilors\\".Michel Rouche, 422‚Äì423  Legacy  Carolingian Empire (green) in 814 The term Frank has been used by many of the Eastern Orthodox and Muslim neighbours of medieval Latin Christendom (and beyond, such as in Asia) as a general synonym for a European from Western and Central Europe, areas that followed the Latin rites of Christianity under the authority of the Pope in Rome.K√∂nig, Daniel G., Arabic-Islamic Views of the Latin West. Tracing the Emergence of Medieval Western Europe, Oxford: OUP, 2015, chap. 6, p. 289-230. Another term with similar use was Latins. Modern historians often refer to Christians following the Latin rites in the eastern Mediterranean as Franks or Latins, regardless of their country of origin, whereas they use the words Rhomaios and R√ªmi (\\"Roman\\") for Orthodox Christians. On a number of Greek islands, Catholics are still referred to as () or \\"Franks\\", for instance on Syros, where they are called (). The period of Crusader rule in Greek lands is known to this day as the Frankokratia (\\"rule of the Franks\\"). Latin Christians living in the Middle East (particularly in the Levant) are known as Franco-Levantines. During the Mongol Empire in the 13-14th centuries, the Mongols used the term \\"Franks\\" to designate Europeans.Igor de Rachewiltz ‚Äì Turks in China under the Mongols, in: China Among Equals: The Middle Kingdom and its Neighbors, 10th‚Äì14th Centuries, p. 281 The term Frangistan (\\"Land of the Franks\\") was used by Muslims to refer to Christian Europe and was commonly used over several centuries in Iran and the Ottoman Empire. The Chinese called the Portuguese ‰ΩõÈÉéÊ©ü (\\"Franks\\") in the 1520s at the Battle of Tunmen and Battle of Xicaowan. Some other varieties of Mandarin Chinese pronounced the characters as Fah-lan-ki. The Mediterranean Lingua Franca (or \\"Frankish language\\") was a pidgin first spoken by 11th century European Christians and Muslims in Mediterranean ports that remained in use until the 19th century. Examples of derived words include: * () in Greek * in Albanian * in Turkish * in Azerbaijani (derived from Persian) * , and in ArabicRashid al-din Fazl All√¢h, quoted in Karl Jahn (ed.) Histoire Universelle de Rasid al-Din Fadl Allah Abul=Khair: I. Histoire des Francs (Texte Persan avec traduction et annotations), Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1951. (Source: M.

When the presence of US soldiers during the Vietnam War placed Thai people in contact with African Americans, they (and people of African ancestry in general) came to be called (\\"Black Farang\\", ). Such words sometimes also connote things, plants or creatures introduced by Europeans/Franks. For example, in Khmer, , literally \\"French Chicken\\", refers to a turkey and in Thai, is the name both for Europeans and for the guava fruit, introduced by Portuguese traders over 400 years ago. In contemporary Israel, the Yiddish word () has, by a curious etymological development, come to refer to Mizrahi Jews and carries a strong pejorative connotation. Some linguists (among them Drs. Jan Tent and Paul Geraghty) have suggested that the Samoan and generic Polynesian term for Europeans, Palagi (pronounced Puh-LANG-ee) or Papalagi, might also be cognate, possibly a loan term gathered by early contact between Pacific islanders and Malays.Tent, J., and Geraghty, P., (2001) \\"Exploding sky or exploded myth? The origin of Papalagi\\", Journal of the Polynesian Society, 110, 2: pp. 171‚Äì214.

French art consists of the visual and plastic arts (including French architecture, woodwork, textiles, and ceramics) originating from the geographical area of France. Modern France was the main centre for the European art of the Upper Paleolithic, then left many megalithic monuments, and in the Iron Age many of the most impressive finds of early Celtic art. The Gallo-Roman period left a distinctive provincial style of sculpture, and the region around the modern Franco-German border led the empire in the mass production of finely decorated Ancient Roman pottery, which was exported to Italy and elsewhere on a large scale. With Merovingian art the story of French styles as a distinct and influential element in the wider development of the art of Christian Europe begins. France can fairly be said to have been a leader in the development of Romanesque art and Gothic art, before the Renaissance led to Italy becoming the main source of stylistic developments until France matched Italy's influence during the Rococo and Neoclassicism periods and then regained the leading role in the Arts from the 19th to the mid-20th century. Historic overviewPrehistory= Front and side view of the Venus of Brassempouy Currently, the earliest known European art is from the Upper Palaeolithic period of between 40,000 and 10,000 years ago and France has a large selection of extant pre-historic art from the Ch√¢telperronian, Aurignacian, Solutrean, Gravettian, and Magdalenian cultures. This art includes cave paintings, such as the famous paintings at Pech Merle in the Lot in Languedoc which date back to 16,000 BC, Lascaux, located near the village of Montignac, in the Dordogne, dating back to between 13,000 and 15,000 BC, or perhaps, as far back as 25,000 BC, the Cosquer Cave, the Chauvet Cave dating back to 29,000 BC, and the Trois-Fr√®res cave; and portable art, such as animal carvings and great goddess statuettes called Venus figurines, such as the \\"Venus of Brassempouy\\" of 21,000 BC, discovered in the Landes, now in the museum at the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye or the Venus of Lespugue at the Mus√©e de l'Homme. Ornamental beads, bone pins, carvings, as well as flint and stone arrowheads also are among the prehistoric objects from the area of France. Speculations exist that only Homo sapiens are capable of artistic expression, however, a recent find, the Mask of la Roche-Cotard‚Äîa Mousterian or Neanderthal artifact, found in 2002 in a cave near the banks of the Loire River, dating back to about 33,000 B.C.‚Äînow suggests that Neanderthal humans may have developed a sophisticated and complex artistic tradition. The Menec alignments, the most well-known megalithic site among the Carnac stones In the Neolithic period (see Neolithic Europe), megalithic (large stone) monuments, such as the dolmens and menhirs at Carnac, Saint- Sulpice-de-Faleyrens and elsewhere in France begin to appear; this appearance is thought to start in the fifth millennium BC, although some authors speculate about Mesolithic roots. In France there are some 5,000 megalithics monuments, mainly in Brittany, where there is the largest concentration of these monuments. In this area there is wide variety of these monuments that have been well preserved, like menhirs, dolmen, cromlechs and cairns. The Cairn of Gavrinis in southern Brittany is an outstanding example of megalithic art : its 14 meters inner corridor is nearly completely adorned with ornamental carvings. The great broken menhir of Er-Grah, now in four pieces was more than 20 meters high originally, making it the largest menhir ever erected. France has also numerous painted stones, polished stone axes, and inscribed menhirs from this period. The Grand-Pressigny area was known for its precious silex blades and they were extensively exported during the Neolithic. In France from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age, one finds a variety of archaeological cultures, including the R√∂ssen culture of c. 4500‚Äì4000 BC, Beaker culture of c. 2800‚Äì1900 BC, Tumulus culture of c. 1600‚Äì1200 BC, Urnfield culture of c. 1300‚Äì800 BC, and, in a transition to the Iron Age, Hallstatt culture of c. 1200‚Äì500 BC. For more on Prehistoric sites in Western France, see Prehistory of Brittany. =Celtic and Roman periods= Agris Helmet From the Proto-Celtic Urnfield and Hallstat cultures, a continental Iron Age Celtic art developed; mainly associated with La T√®ne culture, which flourished during the late Iron Age from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the first century BC. This art drew on native, classical and perhaps, the Mediterranean, oriental sources. The Celts of Gaul are known through numerous tombs and burial mounds found throughout France. Celtic art is very ornamental, avoiding straight lines and only occasionally using symmetry, without the imitation of nature nor ideal of beauty central to the classical tradition, but apparently, often involves complex symbolism. This artwork includes a variety of styles and often incorporates subtly modified elements from other cultures, an example being the characteristic over-and-under interlacing which arrived in France only in the sixth century, although it was already used by Germanic artists. The Celtic Vix grave in present-day Burgundy revealed the largest bronze crater of the Antiquity, that was probably imported by Celtic aristocrats from Greece. Th√©√¢tre antique d'Orange The region of Gaul () came under the rule of the Roman Empire from the first century BC to the fifth century AD. Southern France, and especially Provence and Languedoc, is known for its many intact Gallo-Roman monuments. Lugdunum, modern Lyon, was at the time of the Roman Empire the largest city outside Italy and gave birth to two Roman Emperors. The city still boasts some Roman remains including a Theater. Monumental works from this period include the amphitheater in Orange, Vaucluse, the \\"Maison Carr√©e\\" at N√Æmes which is one of the best preserved Roman temples in Europe, the city of Vienne near Lyon, which features an exceptionally well preserved temple (the temple of Augustus and Livia), a circus as well as other remains, the Pont du Gard aqueduct which is also in an exceptional state of preservation, the Roman cities of Glanum and Vaison-la-Romaine, two intact Gallo-Roman arenas in N√Æmes and Arles, and the Roman baths, and the arena of Paris. =Medieval period=Merovingian art Merovingian art is the art and architecture of the Merovingian dynasty of the Franks, which lasted from the fifth century to the eighth century in present-day France and Germany. The advent of the Merovingian dynasty in Gaul during the fifth century led to important changes in the arts. In architecture, there was no longer the desire to build robust and harmonious buildings. Sculpture regressed to being little more than a simple technique for the ornamentation of sarcophagi, altars, and ecclesiastical furniture. On the other hand, the rise of gold work and manuscript illumination brought about a resurgence of Celtic decoration, which, with Christian and other contributions, constitutes the basis of Merovingian art. The unification of the Frankish kingdom under Clovis I (465‚Äì511) and his successors, corresponded with the need to build churches. The plans for them probably were copied from Roman basilicas. Unfortunately, these timber structures have not survived because of destruction by fire, whether accidental or caused by the Normans at the time of their incursions. Carolingian art illumination Carolingian art is the approximate 120-year period from 750 to 900‚Äîduring the reign of Charles Martel, Pippin the Younger, Charlemagne, and his immediate heirs‚Äîpopularly known as the Carolingian Renaissance. The Carolingian era is the first period of the Medieval art movement known as Pre-Romanesque. For the first time, Northern European kings patronized classical Mediterranean Roman art forms, blending classical forms with Germanic ones, creating entirely new innovations in figurine line drawing, and setting the stage for the rise of Romanesque art and, eventually, Gothic art in the West. Illuminated manuscripts, metalwork, small-scale sculpture, mosaics, and frescos survive from the period. The Carolingians also undertook major architectural building campaigns at numerous churches in France. These include, those of Metz, Lyon, Vienne, Le Mans, Reims, Beauvais, Verdun, Saint-Germain in Auxerre, Saint- Pierre in Flavigny, and Saint-Denis, as well as the town center of Chartres. The Centula Abbey of Saint-Riquier (Somme), completed in 788, was a major achievement in monastic architecture. Another important building (mostly lost today) was \\"Theodulf's Villa\\" in Germigny-des-Pr√©s. With the end of Carolingian rule around 900, artistic production halted for almost three generations. After the demise of the Carolingian Empire, France split into a number of feuding provinces, lacking any organized patronage. French art of the tenth and eleventh centuries was produced by local monasteries to promote literacy and piety, however, the primitive styles produced were not so highly skilled as the techniques of the earlier Carolingian period. Multiple regional styles developed based on the chance availability of Carolingian manuscripts as models to copy, and the availability of itinerant artists. The monastery of Saint Bertin became an important center under its abbot Odbert (986‚Äì1007), who created a new style based on Anglo-Saxon and Carolingian forms. The nearby abbey of St. Vaast (Pas-de-Calais) also created a number of important works. In southwestern France a number of manuscripts were produced c. 1000, at the monastery of Saint Martial in Limoges, as well as at Albi, Figeac, and Saint- Sever-de-Rustan in Gascony. In Paris a unique style developed at the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s. In Normandy a new style arose in 975. By the later tenth century with the Cluny reform movement and a revived spirit for the concept of Empire, art production resumed. Central tympanum of the narthex of the V√©zelay Abbey in V√©zelay, 1140‚Äì1150 Romanesque art Romanesque art refers to the art of Western Europe during a period of one hundred and fifty years, from approximately 1000 AD to the rise of the Gothic style, which arose in the middle of the twelfth century in France. \\"Romanesque Art\\" was marked by a renewed interest in Roman construction techniques. For example, the twelfth- century capitals on the cloister of Saint-Guilhem-le-D√©sert, adopt an acanthus-leaf motif and the decorative use of drill holes, which were commonly found on Roman monuments. Other important Romanesque buildings in France include the abbey of Saint-Beno√Æt-sur-Loire in Loiret, the churches of Saint- Foy in Conques of Aveyron, Saint-Martin in Tours, Saint-Philibert in Tournus of Sa√¥ne-et-Loire, Saint-Remi in Reims, and Saint-Sernin in Toulouse. In particular, Normandy experienced a large building campaign in the churches of Bernay, Mont-Saint-Michel, Coutances Cathedral, and Bayeux. Interior of the Chapelle Haute, Sainte Chapelle, Paris Most Romanesque sculpture was integrated into church architecture, not only for aesthetic, but also for structural purposes. Small-scale sculpture during the pre-Romanesque period was influenced by Byzantine and Early Christian sculpture. Other elements were adopted from various local styles of Middle Eastern countries. Motifs were derived from the arts of the \\"barbarian,\\" such as grotesque figures, beasts, and geometric patterns, which were all important additions, particularly in the regions north of the Alps. Among the important sculptural works of the period are the ivory carvings at the monastery of Saint Gall. Monumental sculpture was rarely practised separately from architecture in the Pre- Romanesque period. For the first time after the fall of the Roman empire, monumental sculpture emerged as a significant art form. Covered church fa√ßades, doorways, and capitals all increased and expanded in size and importance, as in the Last Judgment Tympanum, Beaulieu-sur-Dordogne, and the Standing Prophet at Moissac. Monumental doors, baptismal fonts, and candle holders, frequently decorated with scenes from biblical history, were cast in bronze, attesting to the skills of the contemporary metalworkers. Frescoes were applied to the vaults and walls of churches. Rich textiles and precious objects in gold and silver, such as chalices and reliquaries, were produced in increasing numbers to meet the needs of the liturgy, and to serve the cult of the saints. In the twelfth century, large-scale stone sculpture spread throughout Europe. In the French Romanesque churches of Provence, Burgundy, and Aquitaine, sculptures adorned the fa√ßades and statues were incorporated into the capitals. Gothic Gothic art and architecture were products of a Medieval art movement that lasted about three hundred years. It began in France, developing from the Romanesque period in the mid-twelfth century. By the late fourteenth century, it had evolved toward a more secular and natural style known as, International Gothic, which continued until the late fifteenth century, when it evolved further, into Renaissance art. The primary Gothic art media were sculpture, panel painting, stained glass, fresco, and illuminated manuscript. The Western (Royal) Portal at Chartres Cathedral, c. 1145, these architectural statues are the earliest Gothic sculptures, a revolution in style and the models for a generation of sculptors Gothic architecture was born in the middle of the twelfth century in √éle-de-France, when Abbot Suger built the abbey at St. Denis, c. 1140, considered the first Gothic building, and soon afterward, the Chartres Cathedral, c. 1145. Prior to this, there had been no sculpture tradition in √éle-de-France‚Äîso sculptors were brought in from Burgundy, who created the revolutionary figures acting as columns in the Western (Royal) Portal of Chartres Cathedral (see image) ‚Äîit was an entirely new invention in French art, and would provide the model for a generation of sculptors. Other notable Gothic churches in France include Bourges Cathedral, Amiens Cathedral, Notre-Dame de Laon, Notre Dame in Paris, Reims Cathedral, the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, Strasbourg Cathedral. The designations of styles in French Gothic architecture are as follows: Early Gothic, High Gothic, Rayonnant, and Late Gothic or \\"Flamboyant\\". Division into these divisions is effective, but debatable. Because Gothic cathedrals were built over several successive periods, and the artisans of each period not necessarily following the wishes of previous periods, the dominant architectural style often changed during the building of a particular building. Consequently, it is difficult to declare one building as belonging to certain era of Gothic architecture. It is more useful to use the terms as descriptors for specific elements within a structure, rather than applying it to the building as a whole. The French ideas spread. Gothic sculpture evolved from the early stiff and elongated style, still partly Romanesque, into a spatial and naturalistic treatment in the late twelfth and early thirteenth century. Influences from surviving ancient Greek and Roman sculptures were incorporated into the treatment of drapery, facial expression, and pose of the Dutch-Burgundian sculptor, Claus Sluter, and the taste for naturalism first signaled the end of Gothic sculpture, evolving into the classicistic Renaissance style by the end of the fifteenth century. Enguerrand Quarton, The Coronation of the Virgin, 1452‚Äì53 Painting in a style that may be called, \\"Gothic,\\" did not appear until about 1200, nearly fifty years after the start of Gothic architecture and sculpture. The transition from Romanesque to Gothic is very imprecise and by no means clearly delineated, but one may see the beginning of a style that is more somber, dark, and emotional than the previous period. This transition occurs first in England and France around 1200, in Germany around 1220, and in Italy around 1300. Painting, the representation of images on a surface, was practiced during the Gothic period in four primary crafts, frescos, panel paintings, manuscript illumination, and stained glass. Frescoes continued to be used as the main pictorial narrative craft on church walls in southern Europe as a continuation of early Christian and Romanesque traditions. In the north, stained glass remained the dominant art form until the fifteenth century. At the end of the 14th century and during the 15th century French princely courts like those of the dukes of Burgundy, the duke of Anjou or the duke of Berry as well as the pope and the cardinals in Avignon employed renowned painters, like the Limbourg Brothers, Barth√©lemy d'Eyck, Enguerrand Quarton or Jean Fouquet, who developed the so-called International Gothic style that spread through Europe and incorporated the new Flemish influence as well as the innovations of the Italian early Renaissance artists. =Early Modern period= Diana the Huntress - School of Fontainebleau, 1550‚Äì1560 In the late fifteenth century, the French invasion of Italy and the proximity of the vibrant Burgundy court, with its Flemish connections, brought the French into contact with the goods, paintings, and the creative spirit of the Northern and Italian Renaissance. Initial artistic changes at that time in France were executed by Italian and Flemish artists, such as Jean Clouet and his son Fran√ßois Clouet, along with the Italians, Rosso Fiorentino, Francesco Primaticcio, and Niccol√≤ dell'Abbate of what is often called the first School of Fontainebleau from 1531. Leonardo da Vinci also was invited to France by Fran√ßois I, but other than the paintings which he brought with him, he produced little for the French king. The art of the period from Fran√ßois I through Henri IV often is heavily inspired by late Italian pictorial and sculptural developments commonly referred to as Mannerism, which is associated with the later works of Michelangelo as well as Parmigianino, among others. It is characterized by figures which are elongated and graceful that rely upon visual rhetoric, including the elaborate use of allegory and mythology. Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of the French Renaissance was the construction of the Ch√¢teaux of the Loire Valley. No longer conceived of as fortresses, such pleasure palaces took advantage of the richness of the rivers and lands of the Loire region and they show remarkable architectural skill. Baroque and Classicism Les Bergers d‚ÄôArcadie by Nicolas Poussin, 1637-38 The seventeenth century marked a golden age for French art in all fields. In the early part of the seventeenth century, late mannerist and early Baroque tendencies continued to flourish in the court of Marie de Medici and Louis XIII. Art from this period shows influences from both the north of Europe, namely the Dutch and Flemish schools, and from Roman painters of the Counter-Reformation. Artists in France frequently debated the contrasting merits of Peter Paul Rubens with his Flemish baroque, voluptuous lines and colors to Nicolas Poussin with his rational control, proportion, Roman classicist baroque style. Another proponent of classicism working in Rome was Claude Gell√©e, known as Le Lorrain, who defined the form of classical landscape. Many young French painters of the beginning of the century went to Rome to train themselves and soon assimilated Caravaggio's influence like Valentin de Boulogne and Simon Vouet. The later is credited with bringing the baroque in France and at his return in Paris in 1627 he was named first painter of the king. But French painting soon departed from the extravagance and naturalism of the Italian baroque and painters like Eustache Le Sueur and Laurent de La Hyre, following Poussin example developed a classicist way known as Parisian Atticism, inspired by Antiquity, and focusing on proportion, harmony and the importance of drawing. Even Vouet, after his return from Italy, changed his manner to a more measured but still highly decorative and elegant style. Georges de La Tour, The Penitent Magdalene, c. 1640. But at the same time there was still a strong Caravaggisti Baroque school represented in the period by the amazing candle-lit paintings of Georges de La Tour. The wretched and the poor were featured in a quasi-Dutch manner in the paintings by the three Le Nain brothers. In the paintings of Philippe de Champaigne there are both propagandistic portraits of Louis XIII' s minister Cardinal Richelieu and other more contemplative portraits of people in the Catholic Jansenist sect. In architecture, architects like Salomon de Brosse, Fran√ßois Mansart and Jacques Lemercier helped define the French form of the baroque, developing the formula of the urban h√¥tel particulier that was to influence all of Europe and strongly departed from the Italian equivalent, the palazzo. Many aristocratic castles were rebuilt in the new classic-baroque style, some of the most famous being Maisons and Cheverny, characterized by high roofs \\"√† la fran√ßaise\\" and a form that retained the medieval model of the castle adorned with prominent towers. From the mid to late seventeenth century, French art is more often referred to by the term \\"Classicism\\" which implies an adherence to certain rules of proportion and sobriety uncharacteristic of the Baroque, as it was practiced in most of the rest of Europe during the same period. Under Louis XIV, the Baroque as it was practiced in Italy, was not in French taste, for instance, as Bernini's famous proposal for redesigning the Louvre was rejected by Louis XIV.Ch√¢teau de Vaux-le-Vicomte by Louis Le Vau. Through propaganda, wars, and great architectural works, Louis XIV launched a vast program designed for the glorification of France and his name. The Palace of Versailles, initially a tiny hunting lodge built by his father, was transformed by Louis XIV into a marvelous palace for f√™tes and parties, under the direction of architects Louis Le Vau (who had also built the ch√¢teau de Vaux-le-Vicomte) and Jules Hardouin Mansart (who built the church of the Invalides in Paris), painter and designer Charles Le Brun, and the landscape architect Andr√© Le N√¥tre who perfected the rational form of the French garden that from Versailles spread in all of Europe. For sculpture Louis XIV's reign also proved an important moment thanks to the King's protection of artists like Pierre Puget, Fran√ßois Girardon and Antoine Coysevox. In Rome, Pierre Legros, working in a more baroque manner, was one of the most influential sculptors of the end of the century. Rococo and Neoclassicism Boiseries of the Salon de la princesse by Germain Boffrand, h√¥tel de Soubise, Paris Rococo and Neoclassicism are terms used to describe the visual and plastic arts and architecture in Europe from the early eighteenth century to the end of the eighteenth century. In France, the death of Louis XIV in 1715 lead to a period of freedom commonly called the R√©gence. Versailles was abandoned from 1715 to 1722, the young king Louis XV and the government led by the duke of Orl√©ans residing in Paris. There a new style emerged in the decorative arts, known as rocaille : the asymmetry and dynamism of the baroque was kept but renewed in a style that is less rhetoric and with less pompous effects, a deeper research of artificiality and use of motifs inspired by nature. This manner used to decorate rooms and furniture also existed in painting. Rocaillle painting turned toward lighters subjects, like the \\"f√™tes galantes\\", theater settings, pleasant mythological narratives and the female nude. Most of the times the moralising sides of myths or history paintings are omitted and the accent is put on the decorative and pleasant aspect of the scenes depicted. Paintings from the period show an emphasis more on color than drawing, with apparent brush strokes and very colorful scenes. Important French painters from this period include Antoine Watteau, considered the inventor of the f√™te galante, Nicolas Lancret and Fran√ßois Boucher, known for his gentle pastoral and galant scenes. Pastel portrait painting became particularly fashionable in Europe at the time and France was the major center of activity for pastellists, with the prominent figures of Maurice Quentin de La Tour, Jean-Baptiste Perronneau and the Swiss Jean-Etienne Liotard. Inspiration by Jean-Honor√© Fragonard, 1769 The Louis XV style of decoration, although already apparent at the end of the last reign, was lighter with pastel colors, wood panels, smaller rooms, less gilding, and fewer brocades; shells, garlands, and occasional Chinese subjects predominated. The Chantilly, Vincennes and then S√®vres manufactures produced some of the finest porcelain of the time. The highly skilled √©b√©nistes, cabinet-makers mostly based in Paris, created elaborate pieces of furniture with precious wood and bronze ornaments that were to be highly praised and imitated in all of Europe. The most famous are Jean-Fran√ßois Oeben, who created the work desk of king Louis XV in Versailles, Bernard II van Risamburgh and Jean-Henri Riesener. Highly skilled artists, called the ciseleur-doreurs, specialized in bronze ornaments for furniture and other pieces of decorative arts - the most famous being Pierre Gouthi√®re and Pierre-Philippe Thomire. Talented silversmiths like Thomas Germain and his son Fran√ßois-Thomas Germain created elaborate silverware services that were highly praised by the various royalties of Europe. Rooms in ch√¢teaux and h√¥tels particuliers were more intimate than during the reign of Louis XIV and were decorated with rocaille style boiseries (carved wood panels covering the walls of a room) conceived by architects like Germain Boffrand and Gilles-Marie Oppenord or ornemanistes (designers of decorative objects) like Juste-Aur√®le Meissonnier. Place de la Bourse in Bordeaux by Ange-Jacques Gabriel The most prominent architects of the first half of the century were, apart Boffrand, Robert de Cotte and Ange-Jacques Gabriel, who designed public squares like the place de la Concorde in Paris and the place de la Bourse in Bordeaux in a style consciously inspired by that of the era of Louis XIV. During the first half of the century, France replaced Italy as the artistic centre and main artistic influence in Europe and many French artists worked in other courts across the continent. The latter half of the eighteenth century continued to see French preeminence in Europe, particularly through the arts and sciences, and the speaking the French language was expected for members of the European courts. The French academic system continued to produce artists, but some, such as Jean-Honor√© Fragonard and Jean-Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin, explored new and increasingly impressionist styles of painting with thick brushwork. Although the hierarchy of genres continued to be respected officially, genre painting, landscape, portrait, and still life were extremely fashionable. Chardin and Jean-Baptiste Oudry were hailed for their still lives although this was officially considered the lowest of all genres in the hierarchy of painting subjects. Prometheus by Nicolas-S√©bastien Adam, 1762 One also finds in this period a Pre-romanticist aspect. Hubert Robert's images of ruins, inspired by Italian capriccio paintings, are typical in this respect as well as the image of storms and moonlight marines by Claude Joseph Vernet. So too the change from the rational and geometrical French garden of Andr√© Le N√¥tre to the English garden, which emphasized artificially wild and irrational nature. One also finds in some of these gardens‚Äîcurious ruins of temples‚Äîcalled \\"follies\\". The last half of the eighteenth century saw a turn to Neoclassicism in France, that is to say a conscious use of Greek and Roman forms and iconography. This movement was promoted by intellectuals like Diderot, in reaction to the artificiality and the decorative essence of the rocaille style. In painting, the greatest representative of this style is Jacques-Louis David, who, mirroring the profiles of Greek vases, emphasized the use of the profile. His subject matter often involved classical history such as the death of Socrates and Brutus. The dignity and subject matter of his paintings were greatly inspired by the works of Nicolas Poussin from the seventeenth century. Poussin and David were in turn major influences on Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. Other important neoclassical painters of the period are Jean-Baptiste Greuze, Joseph-Marie Vien and, in the portrait genre, Elisabeth-Louise Vigee-Le Brun. Neoclassicism also penetrated decorative arts and architecture. Jacques-Louis David, Oath of the Horatii, 1786 Architects like Ledoux and Boull√©e developed a radical style of neoclassical architecture based on simple and pure geometrical forms with a research of simetry and harmony, elaborating visionary projects like the complex of the Saltworks of Arc-et-Senans by Ledoux, a model of an ideal factory developed from the rational concepts of the Enlightment thinkers. =Modern period=19th century The French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars brought great changes to the arts in France. The program of exaltation and myth making attendant to the Emperor Napoleon I of France was closely coordinated in the paintings of David, Gros and Gu√©rin. Jean-Auguste- Dominique Ingres was the main figure of neoclassicism until the 1850s and a prominent teacher, giving priority to drawing over color. Meanwhile, Orientalism, Egyptian motifs, the tragic anti-hero, the wild landscape, the historical novel, and scenes from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance‚Äîall these elements of Romanticism‚Äîcreated a vibrant period that defies easy classification. The most important romantic painter of the period was Eug√®ne Delacroix, who had a successful public career and was the main opponent of Ingres. Before him, Th√©odore G√©ricault opened the path to romanticism with his monumental Raft of the Medusa exposed at the 1819 Salon. Camille Corot tried to escape the conventional and idealized form of landscape painting influenced by classicism to be more realist and sensible to atmospheric variations at the same time. The Massacre at Chios, Eug√®ne Delacroix, 1824 Romantic tendencies continued throughout the century, both idealized landscape painting and Realism have their seeds in Romanticism. The work of Gustave Courbet and the Barbizon school are logical developments from it, as is the late nineteenth century Symbolism of such painters as Gustave Moreau, the professor of Henri Matisse and Georges Rouault, as well as Odilon Redon. Academic painting developed at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts was the most successful with the public and the State : highly trained painters like Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, William Bouguereau and Alexandre Cabanel painted historical scenes inspired by the antique, following the footsteps of Ingres and the neoclassics. Though criticized for their conventionalism by the young avant-garde painters and critics, the most talented of the Academic painters renewed the historical genre, drawing inspiration from multiple cultures and techniques, like the Orient and the new framings made possible by the invention of photography For many critics √âdouard Manet wrote of the nineteenth century and the modern period (much as Charles Baudelaire does in poetry). His rediscovery of Spanish painting from the golden age, his willingness to show the unpainted canvas, his exploration of the forthright nude, and his radical brush strokes are the first steps toward Impressionism. Impressionism would take the Barbizon school one step farther, rejecting once and for all a belabored style and the use of mixed colors and black, for fragile transitive effects of light as captured outdoors in changing light (partly inspired by the paintings of J. M. W. Turner and Eug√®ne Boudin). It led to Claude Monet with his cathedrals and haystacks, Pierre-Auguste Renoir with both his early outdoor festivals and his later feathery style of ruddy nudes, Edgar Degas with his dancers and bathers. Other important impressionists were Alfred Sisley, Camille Pissarro and Gustave Caillebotte. After that threshold was crossed, the next thirty years became a litany of amazing experiments. Vincent van Gogh, Dutch born, but living in France, opened the road to expressionism. Georges Seurat, influenced by color theory, devised a pointillist technique that governed the Impressionist experiment and was followed by Paul Signac. Paul C√©zanne, a painter's painter, attempted a geometrical exploration of the world, that left many of his peers indifferent. Paul Gauguin, a banker, found symbolism in Brittany along Emile Bernard and then exoticism and primitivism in French Polynesia. These painters were referred to as Post-Impressionists. Les Nabis, a movement of the 1890s, regrouping painters such as Paul S√©rusier, Pierre Bonnard, √âdouard Vuillard and Maurice Denis, was influenced by Gauguin's example in Brittany: they explored a decorative art in flat plains with the graphic approach of a Japanese print. They preached that a work of art is the end product and the visual expression of an artist's synthesis of nature in personal aesthetic metaphors and symbols. Henri Rousseau, the self-taught dabbling postmaster, became the model for the na√Øve revolution. 20th century Claude Monet, Rouen Cathedral, Facade (Sunset), c. 1892-1894 The early years of the twentieth century were dominated by experiments in colour and content that Impressionism and Post-Impressionism had unleashed. The products of the far east also brought new influences. At roughly the same time, Les Fauves (Henri Matisse, Andr√© Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck, Albert Marquet, Raoul Dufy, Othon Friesz, Charles Camoin, Henri Manguin) exploded into color, much like German Expressionism. The discovery of African tribal masks by Pablo Picasso, a Spaniard living in Paris, lead him to create his Les Demoiselles d'Avignon of 1907. Working independently, Picasso and Georges Braque returned to and refined C√©zanne's way of rationally comprehension of objects in a flat medium, their experiments in cubism also would lead them to integrate all aspects and objects of day-to-day life, collage of newspapers, musical instruments, cigarettes, wine, and other objects into their works. Cubism in all its phases would dominate paintings of Europe and America for the next ten years. (See the article on Cubism for a complete discussion.) World War I did not stop the dynamic creation of art in France. In 1916 a group of discontents met in a bar in Zurich, the Cabaret Voltaire, and created the most radical gesture possible, the anti-art of Dada. At the same time, Francis Picabia and Marcel Duchamp were exploring similar notions. At a 1917 art show in New York, Duchamp presented a white porcelain urinal (Fountain) signed R. Mutt as work of art, becoming the father of the readymade. When Dada reached Paris, it was avidly embraced by a group of young artists and writers who were fascinated with the writings of Sigmund Freud, particularly by his notion of the unconscious mind. The provocative spirit of Dada became linked to the exploration of the unconscious mind through the use of automatic writing, chance operations, and, in some cases, altered states. The surrealists quickly turned to painting and sculpture. The shock of unexpected elements, the use of Frottage, collage, and decalcomania, the rendering of mysterious landscapes and dreamed images were to become the key techniques through the rest of the 1930s. Georges Braque, Violin and Candlestick, 1910 Immediately after this war the French art scene diverged roughly in two directions. There were those who continued in the artistic experiments from before the war, especially surrealism, and others who adopted the new Abstract Expressionism and action painting from New York, executing them in a French manner using Tachism or L'art informel. Parallel to both of these tendencies, Jean Dubuffet dominated the early post-war years while exploring childlike drawings, graffiti, and cartoons in a variety of media. The late 1950s and early 1960s in France saw art forms that might be considered Pop Art. Yves Klein had attractive nude women roll around in blue paint and throw themselves at canvases. Victor Vasarely invented Op-Art by designing sophisticated optical patterns. Artists of the Fluxus movement such as Ben Vautier incorporated graffiti and found objects into their work. Niki de Saint Phalle created bloated and vibrant plastic figures. Arman gathered together found objects in boxed or resin-coated assemblages, and C√©sar Baldaccini produced a series of large compressed object-sculptures. In May 1968, the radical youth movement, through their atelier populaire, produced a great deal of poster-art protesting the moribund policies of president Charles de Gaulle. Many contemporary artists continue to be haunted by the horrors of the Second World War and the specter of the Holocaust. Christian Boltanski's harrowing installations of the lost and the anonymous are particularly powerful.

It was the name given to stakes carried by Roman legionaries for employment as a field fortification, sometimes also called vallus. It is frequently, but incorrectly, called a pilum murale meaning 'wall spear'. The stakes were carried by Roman legionaries; typically two were carried by each soldier. Each stake was made of hardwood, usually oak, about long and about wide at the thickest point. Square in section, the shape tapers to a point at both ends. The central part is narrowed in a way that strongly suggests the function of a handle, although this may not be its actual purpose. Examples that have been found are rough hewn. It seems clear that the stakes were used to form a temporary defence. However, the exact manner in which stakes were used is the subject of debate among experts. It is possible that the stakes were incorporated into the ramparts of a Roman marching camp (castra). Projecting from the ramparts at an angle, they would present a barrier to an attacker attempting to climb up. Alternatively, they could have been placed vertically at the top of the rampart as a fence. Experiments with reconstructions have been disappointing in that such barriers are not strong, as the symmetry of the stakes makes them easy to pull out of the ground. It has been proposed that the stakes were lashed in pairs at intervals along a log or beam to form a Cheval de frise. This could be used, for example, as a moveable barrier to bar a gateway. Alternatively, three stakes might be roped together into a defence resembling the Czech hedgehog ‚Äî a sort of giant caltrop. Defences of this type, employed en masse, can be pushed aside only with difficulty and cannot be collapsed. The advantage of such suggested modes of use is that they are consistent with the symmetry of the stakes and account for the hand grip at the centre which is required to bind the stakes together. In the Battle of Mount Algidus (458 BC), Cincinnatus ordered his men to provide twelve valli each, and used them to build a fortification around the Aequi, who were, at the time, surrounding another Roman army.

Cubo-Futurism was the main school of painting and sculpture practiced by the Russian Futurists. In 1913, the term ‚ÄòCubo-Futurism‚Äô first came to describe works from members of the poetry group ‚ÄòHylaeans,‚Äô as they moved away from poetic Symbolism towards Futurism and zaum, the experimental ‚Äúvisual and sound poetry of Kruchenykh and Khlebninkov‚Äù. Later in the same year the concept and style of ‚ÄòCubo-Futurism‚Äô became synonymous with the works of artists within Russian post-revolutionary avant-garde circles as they interrogated non-representational art through the fragmentation and displacement of traditional forms, lines, viewpoints, colours, and textures within their pieces. The impact of Cubo-Futurism was then felt within performance art societies, with Cubo-Futurist painters and poets collaborating on theatre, cinema, and ballet pieces that aimed to break theatre conventions through the use of nonsensical zaum poetry, emphasis on improvisation, and the encouragement of audience participation (an example being the 1913 Futurist satirical tragedy Vladimir Mayakovsky). The coexistence of these differing strands of artistic practice within Cubo-Futurism reflects an ideological preoccupation with collective renewal and deconstruction (a notion born of their post-revolutionary context) with each poet or painter free to create their own aesthetic consciousness based on the concept of revolution and collective action through reinterpretation of artistic and social traditions.  Background  Importance of Post-Revolutionary context = In the context of late tsarist Russia, society was deeply divided by social class. Russian industrialisation, development, economic growth, and urbanisation fell far behind other Western nations, with the country experiencing high levels of illiteracy, poor health care, and struggling with the limitations of little mass communication outside larger cities. Looking outward at the realities of those from neighbouring countries, artists who would later become members of the Cubo-Futurist movement noticed the impacts of the burgeoning Machine Age on everyday life, recognising the beauty, dynamism, and energy of the utilitarian machine aesthetic leading to a renewed interest in technological modernisation within art, poetry, and life. Active in Russian art circles, Ukrainian-born Aleksandr Shevchenko (1883-1948) echoed this sentiment when, in 1913, he stated, ‚Äúthe world has been transformed into a single, monstrous, fantastic, perpetually-moving machine, into a single huge non-animal automatic organism‚Ä¶ [this] cannot help but be reflected in our thinking and in our spiritual life: in Art‚Äù. The ‚Äúcult of the machine‚Äù became an increasingly utopic concept within Cubo-Futurist circles, with artists perceiving the idyllic phenomenon of machine production as the foremost ‚Äúproletariat creation‚Äù due to its ability to help construct an equitable, collective life for all people regardless of class. This ideological conception of utopic perfection through machinery significantly impacted the stylistic elements of the Cubo-Futurist movement, influencing artists to experiment with pure abstraction, geometric shapes, harsh lines and planes, and the deconstruction of organic forms into powerful structures infused with machine symbolism. = Impact of Russian art collectors = left At the top of early 20th century Russia‚Äôs deep social, political, and class divisions were a small group of elite aristocrats and businessmen. With considerable access to international art markets and dealers, they assembled significant number European masterpieces of the early 20th century for their own personal collections. Collectors and patrons, Sergei Shchukin (1854-1936) and Ivan Morozov (1871-1921), paid special attention to Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, Fauvist, Cubist, and Futurist art from all over Europe amassing a large selection of momentous works, and consequently introducing local Russian artists to art movements, techniques, and styles popular around the continent. Shchukin‚Äôs collection included a considerable number of Picassos, Matisses, Cezannes, Monets, and Gauguins, thus allowing artists in St. Petersburg and Moscow access to Cubist and Futurist artworks that would later influence the development of the Cubo-Futurist movement. ='Hylea' and the impact of F.T. Marinetti's 'Futurist Manifesto' = alt= While Cubo-Futurism was first named and identified in 1913, the movement can be traced back to a congregation of Russian artists who called themselves 'Soyuz Molodyozhi' ('Union of Youth‚Äô) in 1910. The group was brought together by the Ukrainian-born poet and painter David Burliuk (1882-1967) under the name ‚Äòbudetlyane' (a Russian interpretation of the western term ‚Äòfuturists‚Äô), inspired by Italian Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's (1876-1944) 1909 Futurist Manifesto. Marinetti‚Äôs work espoused the need for creatives (e.g. artists and writers) to abandon the past by moving towards the utilisation of the aesthetic language of machinery, industrialisation, urban living, and utilitarian design. For Marinetti and those that followed him, the futurist movement stood for freedom, collectivity, perfection, and social rejuvenation. Influenced by the Futurist Manifesto, the aesthetics of dislocation and fragmentation became the vocabulary of the Cubo-Futurists in their attempt to interrogate the tireless and repetitive dynamism of technology, and highlight their fantasies of a utopic mechanical modernity. The Cubo-Futurists combined the modernist, cosmopolitan spirit of Marinetti‚Äôs futurism with the aesthetic characteristics of analytical cubism (e.g. abstracted forms, flatness, fragmentation, geometric shapes, muted and dark colours, combination of various viewpoints) in order to create their own didactic art form designed to display the revolutionary focus of the artistic community. HistoryOrigin of the term= The term 'Cubo-Futurism' first appeared in a lecture in 1913, originally to refer to the poets who belonged to David and Vladimir Burliuk's literary group, 'Hylaea', also spelt 'Guil√©e' and 'Gylea'. This term was coined by Korney Chukovsky (1882-1969), a Russian art critic, in reference to the work of Vladimir Mayakovsky, Aleksey Kruchonykh, Velimir Khlebnikov, Benedict Livshits, and Vasily Kamensky, members of the Hylaea group. It was only after aforementioned poets began to display shocking public behaviour (for example wearing absurd clothes), when the writers and the movement in general began to be called simply 'Russian Futurism'. As a result, 'Cubo- Futurism' then began to refer to the artists who were influenced by Cubism and Futurism, though both terms still remain interchangeable. =Development of the movement= The earliest appearances of the Cubo-Futurist art style can be found in the works of Natalia Goncharova, who, as early as 1909, applied Cubist and Futurist means of expression in her paintings. Thanks to modern technology (transport and telegraphy, for example) and the artists' experience of other countries, the creatives in Russia knew much about the avant-garde events in Europe. Cubo-Futurism as an art style would begin to take its full form in the years 1912 to 1913, though the style of poetry ended when Russian Futurism itself also faded. One of the first major painters to become a Cubo- Futurist would be Kazimir Malevich, who entered his Cubo-Futurist phase in 1912-13; he termed the works he exhibited at the 1912 'Donkey's Tail' and 1913 'Target' exhibitions as being 'Cubo-Futurist'. For Malevich, Cubo-Futurism would be especially important, because it symbolised the connection between the stillness of conventional Cubism, and the dynamism inherent in Futurism. Rather than simply following the example of painting industrial scenes, set by the Futurists in Italy, or of painting in fairly flat colours, set by the Cubists in France, he placed heavy rural Russian themes on his work; this therefore led to his paintings of traditional village life in a bright, juxtaposing avant-garde style. An example of his Cubo-Futurist work is The Knifegrinder, painted circa 1912-1913. Natalia Goncharova officially entered her Futurist stage in around 1912 to 1913; soon, Cubo-Futurist influences became apparent in her work. This was not, for her, a dramatic change in her previous style of painting. In 1913, an exhibition of her latest work was held at a Russian art gallery, which received a massive variety of responses. Mikhail Larionov followed suit in the latest avant-garde trend, by publishing two manifestos on his and Goncharova's new art movement, Rayonism, which was inspired by Cubo-Futurism. Other Cubo-Futurist artists emerged, for example Aleksandra Ekster, who was involved in Russian Futurist stage design, and Lyubov Popova, who had learned of Cubism during her 1912 stay in Paris, and painted in the Cubo-Futurist style in the years 1913 to 1914. The movement in Russia was notable for having a large percentage of female painters, in contrast to the movement in Italy. Composition with Cards (1915) by Olga Rozanova The Cubo-Futurists - both poets and artists - were also notable for their curious activities, both public and artistic: Mayakovsky wore a bright yellow jacket, Ilia Zdanevich (\\"Iliazd\\") and Burliuk painted on their faces, and some of the painters attached objects upon their canvases, in such manners that predated the Dada avant-garde movement based in Zurich, Berlin, and Paris, which would begin a few years later. In 1913, the opera Victory over the Sun - prologue by Khlebnikov, libretti by Kruchenykh, and music by Mikhail Matyushin - was completed. The costume and set designer was Malevich; the opera has since become notable for starring the first appearance of his influential painting Black Square, as part of a design for a stage curtain. The next year, a Russian Futurist book was published: Tango with Cows, written by aviator-poet Vasily Kamensky and illustrated by the Burliuk brothers. By 1914, the Russian Futurists (many of them Cubo-Futurist) developed a hostility to the Italians. When Marinetti went on a lecture tour of Russia in that year, he was met with general unfriendliness, contrary to the positive reception he had on his previous tour of 1910: Larionov had, for example, a serious argument with a pro-Marinetti cultural figure, the former wishing to greet him with rotten eggs and the latter with flowers, whereas the female Cubo-Futurist painters may have been put off by Marinetti's misogyny. The relations worsened to such an extent that Hylea began to fake the publication dates of their books, as though to state that they were earlier and more Futurist than their colleagues in Italy. The Russian Futurists were also disgusted with the Ego- Futurists, a rival Russian literary association who had been formed in 1911 by the poet Igor Severyanin. This time, the negative feelings went both ways: Severyanin disapproved of the attitudes of the Cubo-Futurists, whilst they dismissed the Ego-Futurists as being immature, tasteless impostors. =End of Cubo-Futurism= By the year 1915, Cubism and Futurism both began to become exhausted for the painters; nevertheless, in 1915, the first all-Russian Futurist exhibition, called 'Tramway V', opened on March 3rd; organised by Ivan Puni, Vladimir Tatlin's works became the main focus, and the exhibition led to a succ√©s de scandale. In 1916, another notable Cubo-Futurist book was published: Universal War, by Aleksei Kruchenykh, perhaps in collaboration with his wife Olga Rozanova. Cubo-Futurism can be said to have ended with the 0,10 Exhibition of 1915-1916, also organised by Puni, and fuelled by the rivalry between Malevich and Tatlin; afterwards, most of the participants of Cubo- Futurism began to direct their energies to other styles of writing or painting, for example Malevich's new art movement Suprematism, which officially began at the 0,10 Exhibition, or with Constructivism. According to the Italian Futurist painter Gino Severini, who had met and heard first-hand accounts from the Russian Futurist painters Larionov, Puni and Kseniya Boguslavskaya, the movement finished in 1916, though, according to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, the style continued to be in use until roughly 1919.  Art  The Knife Grinder (Principle of Glittering) (1912-13), oil on canvas, 79.534 cm √ó 79.534 cm, Yale University Art Gallery For Cubo-Futurist artists, this movement represented a shift in stylistic values from a perception of painting as a reflection of their current reality into a portrayal of idealism through depictions of a perfect future defined by equality and an organised collective consciousness. One such example would be Kazimir Malevich‚Äôs 1912-13 The Knife Grinder (The Glittering Edge). The flickering of reflective metallic colours creates a dynamic representation of motion and energy, depicting the ‚Äúmechanical vibration and dynamic rhythm‚Äù of modernisation through industrialisation and mechanical harmony. The knife grinder himself is central to the composition, camouflaged within the dense abstracted geometric shapes that surround and encompass him, invoking the idea that the man has fused into the mechanical perfection of a giant organised system. To Malevich and other artists of the Cubo-Futurist movement, works like this acted as a social metaphor highlighting the process of transformation, revolution, social rebuilding, and proletariat collectivism they wished to see in their society‚Äôs future. Complex abstracted geometric shapes and representations of perfected mechanical society‚Äôs highlights the revolutionary nature of their work as, ‚Äúonly futurist art is constructed on collective principles‚Ä¶ Only futurist art is, at the present time, ‚Äòthe art of the proletariat‚Äô‚Äù as painter and sculptor Nathan Altman (1889-1970) once stated. Cubo-Futurist artists are unique in their independence and autonomy from other members of the group. Non-representational artists experimenting with Cubo-Futurism ‚Äì such as Kandinsky, Larionov, Malevich, and Tatlin ‚Äì adopted the distinctive ideals and theoretical background of the movement but followed their own aesthetic path, thus depicting the freedom these artists were given to express their own perceptions of a modernised world. Picture of Natalia Goncharova, one of the members of the Cubo-Futurist movement. =Artists= The following artists have been associated with Cubo-Futurism: *Alexander Archipenko *Wladimir Baranoff-Rossine *Alexander Bogomazov *Wladimir Burliuk *Aleksandra Ekster *Natalia Goncharova *Ivan Kliun *Mikhail Larionov *Lyubov Popova *Olga Rozanov *Sonia Terk *Vasyl Yermylov *Alberto Magnelli *Vadym Meller *Aristarkh Lentulov *Oleksandr Bogomazov = Sculpture = Sculpture was a smaller subsect of the Cubo-Futurist movement. Influenced by the work of Italian futurist sculptor and painter Umberto Boccioni, and Pablo Picasso‚Äôs cubist sculptures, Russian artists began experimenting with the combination of the two styles. Artists who experimented with Cubist and Futurist (or a combination of both) styles within their sculptures all expressed a dislike of traditional, classical artistic traditions, thus highlighting the characteristically Cubo-Futurist interest in transformation, innovation, and rejuvenation. Cubo-Futurist sculptors included Joseph Chaikov, Boris Korolev and Vera Mukhina, all of whom taught at the Soviet state art school in Moscow, Vkhutemas. Literature Vladimir Mayakovsky and his muse, Lilya Brik. = Poetry = Poets that experimented with Cubo-Futurist ideals pressed the importance of deconstructing the rules and meaning of poetry, systematically attacking the previously popular Russian classical and symbolist poets due to their propensity to examine metaphysical, esoteric ideas that did not resonate with the common populace. Cubo-Futurist artists had a passion for the democratisation of poetry through the use of chaotic, common language (and concepts) that allowed for freedom of expression and interpretation by the average person. Like artists of the same movement, these poets were interested in creating ‚Äútotally new words and a new way of combining them,‚Äù transforming and recreating poetry into a literary form that depicted their ideas of a modernised future. Poets of the Cubo-Futurist movement saw writing as a ‚Äúlaboratory or workshop‚Äù to renew language and literature, dissecting words and generating neologisms in order to shift contemporary understandings of poetry in order to display their interest in revolution and modernity. This practice is known as ‚Äòtransrational poetry‚Äô (or zaum). The purity and dynamism artists of this movement found in mechanisation and technology, literary Cubo-Futurists found in transrational poetry, with this poetic experimentation later developing to involve the deconstruction of language to onomateopeic forms. One such example of this is Velimir Khlebnikov‚Äòs sound-paintings in his play Zangezi. Poets of this movement also utilised unorthodox methods during their public poetry recitals, such as painted faces, public clowning, and extravagant clothing in order to gather attention to their work, and highlight their futuristic experimentation. = Theatre = Some of the attendees of the Pervyi vserossiiskii sezd Baiachei Budushchegi (poetov futuristov) (First All-Russian Congress of Bards of the Future [The Futurist Poets]) - Mikhail Matyushin, Kazimir Malevich, and Aleksei Kruchenikh. Introduction of Cubo-Futurist theories and ideologies into the realm of theatre production came with widespread scandal among those within the turn-of-the-century Russian society. Similar to those that engaged with Cubo-Futurism within the art world, individuals within the theatre community utilised the movement‚Äôs characteristic ideology of cultural renewal, transformation, and revolution within their works, expanding futurism from the literary and artistic realm and into theatre. In July of 1913, a collection of poets and artists within the Cubo-Futurist movement came together for a meeting entitled Pervyi vserossiiskii sezd Baiachei Budushchego (poetov futuristov) (First-All Russian Congress of Bards of the Future [The Futurist Poets]), establishing that the group would create a ‚Äúnew ‚ÄòFuturian‚Äô theatre‚Äù that would be run by their own collective and ‚Äútransform Russian theatre‚Äù into a modern art form. The Cubo-Futurists employed a more aggressive style within their performances, making use of arte-azione‚Äôs (art-in-action) playfulness, provocative or unintelligible language, improvisation, and unpredictability. As stated by Roman Jakobson (1896-1982): ‚ÄúThe evenings of the Futurists brought‚Ä¶ the public‚Ä¶ The public‚Äôs reaction was various: many came for the scandal, but a broad segment of the student public awaited the new art, wanted the new world‚Äù.  Effects of Cubo-Futurism  Example of Malevich's suprematist works. Kazimir Malevich, Dynamic Suprematism (1916), oil on canvas, 80.2 x 80.3 cm, Tate Gallery Cubo-Futurism was incredibly significant in the development of art styles like Rayism, Suprematism, and Constructivism, with the movement acting as a transitionary phase between objective, figurative works and radical non-objective, non-representational abstract art. Cubo-Futurism gave artists the freedom to engage with the limitations of representation and subjectivity, and experiment with use geometric shapes and fragmented forms in order to convey a movement and dynamism that reflected their attempts to reconstruct understandings of their world and their art. Cubo-Futurism acted as the jumping point for artists Mikhail Larionov (1881-1964) and Natalia Goncharova to develop Rayism (also called Rayonism), one of the first non-objective Russian artistic styles. It was either Rayism or, once more, Cubism and Futurism (or a mixture of all three) which then later influenced Kazimir Malevich to create Suprematism, an art mode that is now considered one of the most significant modern art movements of the 20th century.

Early life Brown farmed in Kathyrn, Alberta, from 1969 to 1999, after which they sold their family farm. After retiring from the Senate of Canada in March 2013, he returned to land development consulting. He attended Mount Royal College and graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a degree in Civil Engineering. He was married to Alice Taylor (1965) and has one child. Campaign for a Triple E Senate Brown was the only person to run in all three of Canada's elected senatorial elections. In 1989 and 2004 he ran under the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party. In 1998, he ran under the Reform Party of Alberta, losing to Stan Waters. He was elected as a senator-in- waiting in 1998 and re-elected in 2004. Brown was the only person ever to be elected to a second term as senator-in-waiting. He had been campaigning for an elected Senate of Canada for over 23 years. He was the founder and chair of the Canadian Committee for a Triple-E Senate. The definitive symbol for the cause, he had been documented in countless Hansard transcripts in provincial legislatures across the country, as well as the federal Parliament and Senate. He first gained fame for his cause when he used his tractor to plow \\"Triple E Senate or Else\\" into his neighbour's two-mile long field. Senatorial career Prime Minister Stephen Harper promised to advise the Governor General to appoint Brown to the next available Senate seat from Alberta, according to comments made in the House of Commons April 18, 2007. The announcement came after long-serving senator Dan Hays announced his intent to vacate his seat in the Senate at the end of June 2007. Brown was appointed to the Canadian Senate on July 10, 2007. Brown served five and a half years until mandatory retirement. Brown became the second person in Canadian history, after Stan Waters, to be appointed to his Senate seat following a provincial senator-in- waiting election. Brown chose to run with the Conservative Party of Canada caucus (federal party), even though he ran under the Progressive Conservative banner (provincial party counterpart), in the Alberta Senate election. On his 75th birthday, March 22, 2013, Brown retired from the Senate as per Senate rules. Awards In 2005, Brown was a recipient of the Alberta Centennial Medal.

Original career, 1956-1958 The original members of the Dubs were: :Richard Blandon (born 16 September 1934 Montgomery, Alabama - died 30 December 1991, New York) (lead) :Cleveland Still (first tenor) :Billy Carlisle (second tenor) :James \\"Jake\\" Miller (baritone) :Thomas Gardner, replaced in 1957 by Tommy Grate (bass) The Dubs formed from the merging of two short-lived vocal groups in Harlem, New York, The Five Wings and The Scale-Tones. The Five Wings (originally \\"The 5 Stars\\") were an up-and-coming group with members Jackie Rue (lead, later of Jackie and the Starlites), Frank Edwards (tenor), Billy Carlisle (second tenor), Melvin Flood (baritone), and Tommy Grate (bass). They recorded for King Records in 1955, but when they were unable to find success, the group began to splinter. Rue, Flood, and Edwards left, Kenny \\"Butch\\" Hamilton joined, and, shortly afterwards, Carlisle's cousin Richard Blandon was in following his discharge from the United States Air Force. Meanwhile, The Scale-Tones had been formed by James \\"Jake\\" Miller and Thomas Gardner, who had added Cleveland Still (lead), James Montgomery, and Don Archer. They made one record on the Jay-Dee label in early 1956. After some prompting by Blandon when he showed up at a Scale-Tones' rehearsal, a new group emerged. This included Blandon and Carlisle from the Five Wings, and Still, Miller and Gardner from the Scale-Tones. The Five Wings' manager, Buddy Johnson's brother Hiram, offered to manage the new group. As The Marvels, they recorded an unsuccessful single, \\"I Won't Have You Breaking My Heart\\", for ABC-Paramount. The group then renamed themselves The Dubs, and released Blandon's song \\"Don't Ask Me To Be Lonely\\" on the Johnson label set up by their manager. Radio acceptance was almost immediate, and the record was picked up for national release on George Goldner's Gone label. It peaked at #72 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in the summer of 1957, although like all their other records it surprisingly failed to make the R&B; chart. Gardner then left the group to be replaced by Tommy Grate. The group's next single, \\"Could This Be Magic\\", also written by Blandon, was another pop hit, rising to #23 later in 1957 and becoming recognized over the years as a doo-wop classic. This success landed the group a spot on an Alan Freed package and they toured extensively in the U.S. and Canada. However, subsequent singles from the group were less successful and, in November 1958 the group decided to split up, disappointed over their meagre earnings. Blandon joined The Vocaleers (who had previously had a 1953 hit, \\"Is It A Dream\\"), and the other members found jobs outside the music industry. Later versions of the group In July 1959, some eight months after its initial release, \\"Chapel of Dreams\\" was reissued and rose to #74 on the charts. To build on its relative success, Blandon left the Vocaleers and reformed The Dubs with Miller, Grate and Carlisle. Cleveland Still, then working as a shipping clerk, did not return, and was replaced by Cordell Brown. The group signed again with ABC-Paramount, and recorded a string of singles over the next two years. In 1962, Still temporarily returned to replace Brown, and the group recorded for several labels, including Josie for one side of a split album with The Shells, The Dubs Meet the Shells. Richard Blandon kept the group active during the 1960s, often re-recording their old hits. By 1971 the group was a trio comprising Blandon, Still, and tenor Kirk Harris, and in 1973 they added baritone Dave Shelley. In the mid 1980s the partnership between Blandon and Still ended, with each forming their own version of The Dubs. Still's group included lead Leslie Anderson, Bernard Jones, John \\"Spider\\" Truesdale and Steve Brown. This group, minus Brown, still performs. Blandon's group included Harris, Jay McKnight, and Kenny White; by 1990, Harris and White had left and been replaced by Danny Foy, Michael Smith, and Doretha Gills. After Richard Blandon died in 1991, his brother, Darryll, took over the lead. The group with Darryl recorded an album, The Magic is Back, in 1997. McKnight later joined Norman Fox & The Rob-Roys.

This lineup split in September 1980, with Hodgson and Cornforth going on to form \\"Makaton Chat\\" with ex-Deja Vu members Anthony Lindo, Graham Lipthorpe and Martin Alderdyce. John Hodgson now records under the name Fast Cakes, who released an album in August 2007 entitled LIVEYOUNGDIEFAST, a second album in September 2012 entitled CALL OFF THE DOGS and a third in 2014 entitled LIFESTORY. The three remaining members regrouped and continued. Eventually, after many lineup changes, the band mutated into Jank Mamba, and then The Flaming Mussolinis, who released two albums in the mid-1980s for Portrait Records (CBS). Savage went on to form a band called Zoom, then another called Disraeli Gears, and released a solo CD in the 1990s on Darlington-based \\"Northern Sky\\". A compilation of tracks recorded by Basczax between 1979-80 entitled The Best Of was released (initially download only) in 2009 on Spectra Records. In February 2010, four members from the 1979-80 line- up (Alan Savage, Jeff Fogarty, John Hodgson & Mick Todd) started recording together once again, with the view to releasing the first new Basczax material for almost 30 years. An album, entitled This Machine Rocks was released (download only) on 1 September 2010.

History1970s‚Äì1982= The company was established as MGM Home Video, releasing MGM films and TV shows. In 1979, MGM joined forces with CBS Video Enterprises, the home video division of the CBS television network, and established MGM/CBS Home Video. In October of that year, they released their first batch of Betamax and VHS tapes. The initial printings of all 24 films were packaged in brown leather clamshell cases with gold lettering; they were presented to CBS executives. Later printings of these films, as well as all printings of later releases by MGM/CBS, were packaged in oversized gray book-style boxes with either the MGM Abstract Lion print logo or CBS Video print logo in the upper right hand corner of the packaging. MGM/CBS also issued some early tapes of Lorimar product; those releases would instead bear the Lorimar print logo where the MGM or CBS Video print logo would normally be. =1982‚Äì1998= In 1982, a year after MGM bought and merged with the near- bankrupt United Artists from Transamerica, CBS dropped out of the video partnership with MGM and moved to 20th Century Fox to create CBS/Fox Video. MGM's video division became known as MGM/UA Home Entertainment Group, Inc., more commonly known as MGM/UA Home Video. MGM/UA continued to license pre-1981 UA and pre-1950 WB films (as well as some post-1981 titles) to CBS/Fox (due to an agreement UA had with Fox years earlier dating back to when CBS/Fox Home Video was called Magnetic Video). In 1986, MGM's pre-May 1986 library (also including the pre-1950 Warner Bros. library, Bugs Bunny: Superstar, the Fleischer Studios/Famous Studios Popeye cartoons, and most US rights to the RKO Pictures library), was acquired by Ted Turner and his company Turner Entertainment Co.. After the library was acquired, MGM/UA signed a deal with Turner to continue distributing the pre-May 1986 MGM and to begin distributing the pre-1950 Warner Bros. libraries for video release (the rest of the library went to Turner Home Entertainment). In October 1990, after Path√© bought MGM, MGM/UA Home Video struck a deal with Warner Home Video to have them distribute MGM/UA titles exclusively on home video.Robert Harris interview with George Feltenstein TheDigitalBits.com (October 28, 2004) MGM/UA began distributing the UA library after its contract with CBS/Fox ended. In 1995, MGM/UA Home Video launched the MGM/UA Family Entertainment label for family-friendly releases. In 1996, Warner made an exclusive deal with Image Entertainment to distribute MGM/UA titles on LaserDisc. they also acquired a majority of the Cannon Films library. (certain rights for other media and select films during the Thorn EMI merger now lie with other entities, and the post-1991 films, as they are owned by Warner Bros. as well as other cannon titles distributed by that company, as well as television and digital rights are now owned by ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks under Paramount Television Studios (formerly CBS Television Distribution), successor to parent company Viacom's syndication unit.) after path√© acquired the company. In 1997, MGM/UA, along with the other studios that were distributed by Warner Home Video, began releasing its titles on DVD. Some of the films MGM released on DVD were from the Turner catalog, which they were still allowed to keep after Turner merged into Time Warner some time before because of their distribution deal. That same year, MGM acquired Orion Pictures. As a result, Orion Home Video (Orion's home video division) was bought out by MGM/UA, and was retained as an in-name-only division until the acquisition deal was finalized in 1998. In 1998, the company was renamed MGM Home Entertainment and MGM/UA Family Entertainment was renamed MGM Family Entertainment. =1998‚Äì2005= In March 1999, MGM paid Warner Bros. $225 million to end their distribution agreement in February 2000; the initial deal was to have expired in 2003. As a result of the deal, MGM gave up the home video rights to the MGM/UA films owned by Turner to Warner Home Video. Upon the expiration of the Warner deal, MGM sold overseas video rights to 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. In 2001, MGM and Amazon.com launched the \\"MGM Movie Vault\\" to distribute VHS copies of selected films, either previously unreleased on video or long out-of-print, exclusively through Amazon. On March 3, 2003, MGM Home Entertainment launched the MGM Kids sub-label.https://www.animationmagazine.net/home-entertainment/mgm-purrs-with- kidvid-label/ In May 2003, MGM reinstated full distribution rights to their products in regions like Australia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, although Fox would continue to distribute for MGM in a majority of developing regions.https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2003-05-27/mgm-home- entertainment-reclaims-full-distribution-operations =2005‚Äìpresent= In 2005, following MGM's acquisition by the Sony-led consortium, MGM released its newest content through Sony Pictures Home Entertainment under the standard MGM label. In 2006, after MGM ended its distribution agreement with Sony, the company announced that it would sign a new distribution deal with 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. Originally, DVD releases of MGM/UA and Columbia TriStar co-releases continued to be distributed by SPHE, since Sony then still owned 20% of MGM, whereas Fox has no controlling interest; however, Fox has since released DVD editions of films based on MGM IPs. In 2010, parent company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer emerged from bankruptcy. As of 2011, MGM no longer releases or markets its own movies. Instead, MGM shared distribution with other studios that handle all distribution and marketing for MGM's projects. Since then, only a handful of MGM's most recent movies, such as Skyfall, Red Dawn, Carrie, RoboCop, If I Stay, Poltergeist (which Fox 2000 Pictures co- produced), Spectre and Lightworkers Media's Son of God have all been released on DVD and Blu-ray by its home video output and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. Others, such as The Hobbit, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, G.I. Joe: Retaliation, Hercules, Hot Tub Time Machine 2, Creed, 22 Jump Street, Ben-Hur and The Magnificent Seven have been released by the home video output of the co-distributor -- in these cases, Warner Home Video, Paramount Home Media Distribution and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment respectively. In 2011, MGM launched the \\"MGM Limited Edition Collection\\", a manufactured-on- demand (MOD) DVD service that issues unreleased and out-of-print titles from the MGM-owned library. Its releases are sold through the Warner Archive Collection. On April 14, 2011, Fox's deal distributing the MGM library was extended through 2016.MGM Re-Ups DVD Deal With Fox Through 2016 , deadline.com On June 27, 2016, Fox's distribution deal with MGM was renewed until June 30, 2020.MGM & 20th Century Fox Renew Home Entertainment Deal, deadline.com With the acquisition of Fox's parent company 21st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company in 2019, MGM announced in their 2019 report that it would not renew its deal with Fox after the current agreement expired on June 30, 2020, and would search for a new distributor afterwards.https://d20qidnmpnrwiu.cloudfront.net/cdn/ff/2EkRrs42qi5_owbYV38OTEhAVmft8wf4qe0Gy3rzkcU/1585084775/public/2020-03/YE%202019%20Financial%20Report.pdf In the studio's 2020 financial report, MGM named Warner Bros.

Many of Orion Pictures' films since its revival have been released through various third-party companies. The remake of The Town That Dreaded Sundown was released by Image Entertainment. However, Fox, and later Warner Bros., would handle home video distribution of Orion's movies released through UAR. MGM's post-April 1986 library is currently distributed by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, which already owns and distributes the studio's pre-May 1986 library through their ownership of Turner Entertainment Co.. MGM also licenses out some of its film and television library to Olive Films, Kino Lorber and The Criterion Collection. Beginning in December 2018, several specific recent MGM films released through the United Artists Releasing joint venture are distributed by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, starting with the DVD/Blu-ray release of Operation Finale on December 4, 2018. On January 14, 2020, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment (MGM's current distributor of catalog titles) and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment (MGM's current distributor of select UAR releases) formed a 10-year home entertainment joint venture in several territories, including North America.

The village itself had a population of 283. https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W37000040 and the community also includes Garthmyl Hall and Refail.  Facilities  Berriew F.C. play in the Mid Wales Football League, the third level of the Welsh football league system. Mirror-artist and sculptor Andrew Logan bought the village squash courts and converted the building into a sculpture museum. There are two pubs in the village, The Talbot and the Lion Hotel. There is also The Horseshoes, a little way out of the village. The Berriew Show is a major attraction for the village and is held every August Bank Holiday Saturday. Attracting locals and people from miles around, it is a showcase for horticulture, agriculture and local craft and has thriving dog, horse and sheep shows.  Best kept village in Wales  Berriew has won this competition many times - although the scheme has now been discontinued. It was first won in 1970. Buildings and architecture Berriew contains many architecturally important buildings. There are 103 Listed Buildings in Berriew of which 5 are Grade II*. Nearly a quarter of the listed building are connected with the Montgomeryshire Canal which runs across the parish to the S.E. of Berriew.British Listed Buildings The most important of the listed buildings are Vaynor, which is probably the earliest brick built house of the mid-17th. century still standing in Montgomeryshire, and Glansevern, designed by the notable Shrewsbury architect Joseph Bromfield in the Greek Revival style and probably the best example of his work. There are two important timber framed houses, the Vicarage which is dated 1616 and Lower Cil Farmhouse. An illustration of the Vicarage was used to illustrate the dustwrapper of the 1st edition of Peter Smith's important book on Welsh Vernacular Architecture ‚Äò'Houses of The Welsh Countryside'‚Äô.Peter Smith (1975), ‚Äò'Houses of The Welsh Countryside'‚Äô, HMSO, London. Another notable house is Garthmyl Hall, Berriew, which is by a leading 19th century designer and architect James Kellaway Colling. There are also a number of other larger houses in Berriew which include Brithdir, a timber framed house which was considerably extended in the early 19th century; Pennant, a fine early brick house built in 1755; Rhiewport, a Regency house that is also probably by Joseph Bromfield, and Trwstllwelyn, a house with much early 18th century brickwork.Bodhilin or Bodheilin, Brithdir, Berriew. A sad loss was the fantasy Gothic villa of Bodheilin in Brithdir township, which was burnt down in 1906.Scourfield R and Haslam R, (2013) Buildings of Wales: Powys; Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire and Breconshire, 2nd edition, Yale University Press. pp80-85 =Timber framed and Cottage Orn√©e houses= Rather than the individual houses, Berriew is best remembered for its half timbered cottages which cluster around the churchyard and along the banks of the river Rhiew. There are further examples in the township of Refail. These can probably be attributed to the architect Thomas Penson. In the late 1830s, at the same time as Penson was working on remodelling Vaynor Park in Berriew for John Winder Lion-Winder, he was also remodelling and building houses in Berriew for the Vaynor estate.Cadw (1999) Register of Landscapes, Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales: Powys. Cardiff, pg. 255. As a result of his work Berriew developed as a village with many attractive Cottage Orn√©e houses. Some of these were rebuilt from earlier timber framed buildings, while others were built in a Tudor Revival style and are some of the earliest examples of Black-and-white Revival architecture. Penson's work can be recognised by the massive brick chimney stacks which have been added to the houses, the ornamental bargeboards to the gables and in some cases the black and white painting on the brick work to give the impression of timber framing.Alfrey J.(2001), Rural Building in Nineteenth-Century North Wales: The Role of the Great Estates, Archaeologia Cambrensis, Vol 147, pg 213, pl.18 =Listed Buildings in Berriew= *Vaynor Park is the main estate in Berriew, lying to the west of the village. *Glansevern Hall and Gardens are adjacent to the village. Glansevern Hall was built between 1801 and 1807 for Sir Arthur Davies Owen, by Joseph Bromfield. *Garthmyl Hall is a Grade II listed house to the south of Berriew. Garthmyl Hall was completely rebuilt in 1859 by the architect James K Colling for Major-General William George Gold. * The Vicarage, which is the residence of the Archdeacon of Montgomery. It is dated 1616 with the initials of the vicar, Thomas Kyffin. Vertical studding with diagonal braces, the upper floor jettied on a moulded bressumer. The porch with railed sides with quadrant decoration. In the late C18, the lobby-chimney was removed, and the vicarage was extended to the west with a brick range. *Lower Cil A well-preserved 16th-century timber-framed farmhouse of Severn Valley Lobby Entrance type. The timbers have been dated by tree-ring dating to 1583 for its original construction.\\"Scourfield\\" (2013), pg 85. = Other features of note = The Berriew section of The Montgomery Canal has a number of important features including a restored lock and the Grade II listed aqueduct which carries the canal over the River Rhiw. It has four segmental arches and is the second- largest masonry structure on the canal. First opened in 1797, it was largely rebuilt in the 19th century and fully restored in the 20th century.

Preliminary Practices (sngon 'gro). Source: (accessed: January 29, 2008) Dharma Fellowship (2009). The Way of the Yogi. Source: (accessed: Thursday February 4, 2010)) refers to the preliminary, preparatory or foundational practices or disciplines (Sanskrit: sƒÅdhanƒÅ) common to all four schools of Tibetan Buddhism and also to Bon. They precede the Generation stage and Completion stage. The term ng√∂ndro literally denotes meanings in the range of \\"something that goes before, something which precedes.\\"Rangjung Yeshe Tibetan-English Dictionary of Buddhist Culture. Source (accessed: June 17, 2008), The preliminary practices establish the foundation for the more advanced and rarefied Vajrayana sƒÅdhanƒÅ which are held to engender realization and the embodiment of Dzogchen, Heruka and Mahamudra. Nevertheless, Vajrayana masters are careful to point out that \\"foundational\\" does not mean \\"lesser\\", that the practice of Ng√∂ndro is a complete and sufficient practice of the spiritual path, and that it can take the practitioner all the way to full enlightenment. In addition to what is generally denoted by the term ng√∂ndro, preparatory practices may also be prescribed for senior and advanced sadhana, e.g.: \\"differentiating sa·πÉsƒÅra and nirvƒÅ·πáa\\" () is the preparatory practice of Kadag Khregschod or \\"cutting through to primordial purity.\\"  History  The use of the practices of Vajrasattva, Mandala offering and Guru Yoga as preliminaries to the practice of anuttarayogatantra sadhanas was well established in India. In Tibet, the tradition came to include prostration practice and the accumulation of large numbers of each practice. Outer and inner preliminaries In general the preliminary practices are divided into two sections or kinds: the first are the common or ordinary kind of preliminary practices, and the second are the special or extraordinary kind of preliminaries. =Outer preliminaries= The common or ordinary preliminaries consists of a series of deep reflections or contemplations on the following four topics: # the freedoms and advantages of precious human rebirth # the truth of impermanence and change # the workings of karma # the suffering of living beings within samsara The above four contemplations are sometimes referred to as \\"the four reminders\\" or \\"the four mind-changers\\" or \\"the four thoughts which turn the mind towards Dharma.\\" Additional reflections may be included in the specific instructions on the outer preliminaries within different lineages, but the above four topics are the main reflections. N.B.: the Four Ordinary Foundations should not be conflated with the Satipatthana. =Inner preliminaries= The special or extraordinary kind of preliminaries consist of : # taking of refuge in the three roots in conjunction with the performance of 100,000 prostrations (purifying pride)'Prostrations' may also be subsumed within sadhana repetitions of various vinyasa forms of yogic discipline, such as Trul Khor, e.g. # cultivation of bodhicitta (purifying jealousy). In some formulations this is included under 1. # 100,000 recitations of Vajrasattva's hundred- syllable mantra (purifying hatred/aversion) # 100,000 mandala offerings (purifying attachment) # 100,000 guru yoga practices (purifying delusion) These practices purify negative deeds and accumulate merit. Traditionally ng√∂ndro practice is done for the enlightenment of the spiritual aspirant and for the benefit of all sentient beings. That is, the merit of doing the practices is dedicated to all sentient beings. These practices can take 1,500 hours of work to accomplish once. Some practitioners do them multiple times. In retreat, that might take six months. Done mixed into daily life it might take years. Various ng√∂ndros Ng√∂ndro is an essential practice of all schools of Tibetan Buddhism as well as the indigenous Yungdrung B√∂n tradition. Each of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism‚ÄîGelug, Kagyu, Nyingma and Sakya have variations as to the order of the preliminaries, the refuge trees visualized, the lineage gurus and deities invoked, prayers etc. Despite these differences all Ng√∂ndro practices have as their goal the enlightenment of the practitioner so that he/she may be of the greatest benefit to all sentient beings, i.e. the cultivation of \\"bodhichitta\\". While some novices may feel that the Ng√∂ndro are somehow \\"lesser\\" than various tantric practices, they are a complete path to enlightenment in and of themselves. The renowned Lama Patrul Rinpoche (1808‚Äì1887) is said to have practiced the Longchen Nyingthig Ng√∂ndro repeatedly throughout his life. Before receiving advanced tantric practices from a qualified spiritual teacher a Ng√∂ndro usually must be completed and fully internalized. Without this foundation, practicing Tantra would be like, \\"planting a scorched seed, nothing will come of it.\\" This was not the case in India or early Tibet, however, as the formalized Ng√∂ndro known today was developed in Tibet. =B√∂n= *There are two cycles of Ng√∂ndro in B√∂n, Zhangzhung sNyan-rgyud and A-khrid. There are some minor differences between the two, however generally the practices are: ** Opening the Heart ** Meditation on Impermanence ** Admitting Misdeeds ** Bodhicitta ** Refuge ** Mandala Offering ** Purification Through Mantra ** Offering the Body ** Guru Yoga Prostrations are part of this and each practice is accumulated 100,000 times. =Gelug= *Lam Rim Ng√∂ndro - sometimes enumerated as having nine rather than five components, with the additional ones being: (6) Dorje Khadro (Vajra Daka) practice, in which black sesame seeds are visualized negativities offered in a fire to the mouth of the fierce deity Dorje Khadro, who consumes them, (7) offering of water bowls, 8) (clay or plaster images of the Buddha), and (9) Samaya Vajra (Damtsig Dorje) mantra. =Kagyu= The various subsects of the Kagyu lineage tend to practice slightly different ng√∂ndro practices. One of the most common in the Karma Kagyu lineage, called the Chariot for Travelling the Path to Freedom, was written by 9th Karmapa Wangchuk Dorje. The 9th Karmapa's ng√∂ndro is used by practitioners of Diamond Way Buddhism. In the Shambhala Buddhist community, a Primordial Rigden Ng√∂ndro written by Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche is practiced as a preliminary to various terma-derived practices received by Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche. Practitioners later go on to practice the Karma Kagyu ng√∂ndro and in some cases one of the Nyingma ng√∂ndro practices. There is also a recent English transliteration of Drukpa Kargyud Ngondro written by HH Shakya Rinchen, the 9th Jey Khenpo of Bhutan, titled \\"The Chariot of Liberation to the Vajra Abode\\" with detailed footnote and important commentaries by HH Jey Tenzin Dondup, the 69th Supreme Lord Abbot of Bhutan. =Nyingma= *Longchen Nyingthig Ng√∂ndro () The Longchen Nyingthik (\\"Heart Essence of the Vast Expanse\\") is a Terma cycle revealed by the master Jigme Lingpa. Since its inception in the late 18th century, it has become one of the most widespread sets of teachings in the Nyingmapa tradition. It is particularly known and loved for its extensive commentarial literature, which includes practice manuals such as the famed Kunzang Lama'i Shelung (\\"Words of my Perfect Teacher\\"). These teachings were originally transmitted by the master Padmasambhava to King Trisong Deutsen, the Dakini Yeshe Tsogyal and the Lotsawa (\\"translator\\") Vairotsana at Samye Monastery in central Tibet. As the time for these teachings to spread was not yet right, they were then written in symbolic script by Yeshe Tsogyal, entrusted to the Dakinis, and hidden to be revealed at a later time. The king later reincarnated as the tert√∂n (\\"treasure revealer\\") Jigme Lingpa. Then, recognizing the time was ripe for them to be practiced, put them down in writing and began to teach. Jigme Lingpa was a reincarnation of two important masters, VimalamitraLongchen Nyingtik at Rigpawiki and King Trisong Deutsen.Approaching the Great Perfection Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (2003) Van Schaik, Sam, Wisdom Publications, p 33 As the embodiment of these two figures, Tibet's two primary Dzogchen lineages were combined in him‚Äîthe Vima Nyingthik and Khandro Nyingthik, both of which are contained in the Nyingthik Yabshi. Hence, the Longchen Nyingthig terma cycle is considered a condensation of these profound teachings. The texts that were revealed by Jigme Lingpa, in their present-day form, comprise three volumes, known as the Nyingthig Tsapod (). The numerous treatises, sadhanas and prayers it contains deal primarily with tantric practice, in particular the 'stages of Development' () and Dzogchen. * Nam Cho Ng√∂ndro The Nam Cho is the \\"sky / space treasure\\" terma as revealed by Terton Migyur Dorje in the Palyul tradition. This Ng√∂ndro practice is known as \\"Buddha in the Palm of your Hand\\" and is preliminary for Dzogchen practice, where one can realize the mind's nature. Terton Migyur Dorje received them from Arya Avalokiteshvara and Guru Rinpoche and then transmitted them to Karma Chagme RƒÅga Asya. The uncommon preliminaries are: Refuge, Bodhictta, Mandala Offering, Long Mandala Offering, The Kusali Chod, Vajrasattva, Guru Yoga, Phowa, Chenrezig Generation in the Six Realms. It includes \\"The Vajra Verses of the Nam Cho Dzogchen.\\" *Dudjom Tersar Ng√∂ndro *Chokling Tersar Ng√∂ndro *K√∂nchok Chid√º Ng√∂ndro *Rangjung Pema Nyingthig Ng√∂ndro =Sakya= *Sakya Ng√∂ndro The practice of ng√∂ndros Like other Vajrayana practices, ng√∂ndro was once held in greater secrecy than today. In the first half of the 20th century, the only westerners that would have known about Ng√∂ndro would have been Himalayan seekers such as John Blofeld, Heinrich Harrer, and Alexandra David-Neel. Today, with the spread of Tibetan Buddhism to the West, there are many practitioners working on different stages of ng√∂ndro at the various Tibetan Buddhist centers in the West, in addition to practitioners at centers and monasteries in Tibet, Nepal, Ladakh, India and Bhutan. Even though the practice of Ng√∂ndro is now fully described in books available to the general public, lineage holders and lamas argue that it is pointless and counter-productive to initiate practice without receiving personal instruction from a teacher who has the required lineage training.Jamgon Kongtrul (2000). The Torch of Certainty. Boston: Shambala Publications (2000). . p. 15 Students may begin prostrations, the first section of the Ng√∂ndro, in anticipation of receiving the Lung (blessing) from a qualified lama. This is especially helpful for students practicing in remote areas, and when travel is difficult. ReferencesSources  * * Further reading * Blofeld, John. The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet.

Vale in 1980. In several issues, Andrea Juno was also credited as an editor. It was the successor to Vale's earlier punk rock fanzine Search & Destroy (1977‚Äì1979), which was started with small donations, provided to Vale by Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. RE/Search has published tabloid-sized magazines and books. Early history monochrom's Arse Elektronika anthologies \\"pr0nnovation?\\" and \\"Do Androids Sleep With Electric Sheep?\\" (published by RE/Search and monochrom) In the late 1970s, Vale was working at City Lights Bookstore, and he was deeply interested in the growing punk rock scene.Kenneth Goldsmith, Duchamp Is My Lawyer: The Polemics, Pragmatics, and Poetics of UbuWeb, Columbia University Press, New York, pp. 256-263 He was dissatisfied with mainstream coverage of the emerging culture, so he decided to form his own independent magazine, known as a zine. Inspired by Claude Levi-Strauss, the father of structural anthropology, Vale decided to treat the magazine like an anthropological project. This meant, \\"...in other words, not to make any assumptions about the culture, and try and use a lot what I call 'first-hand informants.\\" In addition, Vale was inspired by Interview Magazine, which was put out by Andy Warhol. For these reasons, he chose an interview format for the magazine. The first issue was financed through small donations. Allen Ginsberg wrote a $100 check, after a request from Vale. This was followed by $100 from Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Vale knew both writers through City Lights Bookstore. Then, he secured a $200 donation from a friend who was a doctor. The debut issue of Search & Destroy (1977), named after the Stooges song, focused on the emerging punk and new wave scene, with articles on Mabuhay Gardens, the hottest venue for punk in the city, and interviews with the local bands Crime, Vermilion, and the Nuns.http://www.abaa.org/book/659516377 He stated in an interview, \\"...I sort of kept going, but I never thought I would make a living off it.\\" In total, eleven issues of Search & Destroy were published, between 1977 and 1979. Like many other punk cultural figures, Vale saw connections between the punk movement and dadaism and surrealism, and he sought to explore these influences in his zine. Cultural figures and groups such as William S. Burroughs, JG Ballard, Russ Meyers, Lou Reed, Patti Smith, Iggy Pop, Devo, the Clash, Talking Heads, Weirdos, and Jello Biafra were profiled. However, the staff and scene that supported Search & Destroy eventually diminished in size. Vale explained, \\"It took two years to build up 200 hardcore people truly into punk, so that they just got into it 100% and quit working full-time‚Äîmost of them‚Äîand started bands, or publishing, or taking photos, or making posters, or making clothes, or whatever they did. Overnight they all pretty much vanished.\\"  Development of publishing house  The magazine later transformed into a publishing company, named RE/Search Publications. The first issue of RE/Search (1980)http://www.ebay.com/itm/RE-SEARCH-issue-1-1980-original-zine-magazine- Throbbing-Gristle-Research-/261821792488 had photographs by Ruby Ray and articles on Factrix, The Slits, conspiracies (written by Jay Kinney), Young Marble Giants, Boyd Rice's NON, Cabaret Voltaire, Sun Ra, flashcards, Japan, J. G. Ballard, Julio Cort√°zar, rhythm & noise, Soldier of Fortune Magazine, Throbbing Gristle, nuclear disaster, Situationism, Octavio Paz, and \\"punk prostitutes\\". It was distributed by Rough Trade. Following the third issue, issues 4 and 5 were collected as a single volume, a \\"special book issue,\\" with a focus on William S. Burroughs, Brion Gysin, and Throbbing Gristle. Subsequent issues all retained the book format. During this time, Vale also launched a typesetting business, RE/Search Typography. This enabled him to fund the publishing house while managing the typography and designs of RE/Search books. He maintained the typesetting business until 1991, when he sold it so that he could focus on publishing work full-time. In the 1980s and 1990s, RE/Search published books on various underground topics. Some titles included Pranks, Incredibly Strange Films, and Modern Primitives, and the subject matter included profiles of William S. Burroughs, SPK (band), J. G. Ballard, and others. Modern Primitives introduced many readers to piercing, tattooing, scarification, and body modification. It included interviews with Fakir Musafar, Ed Hardy, Lyle Tuttle, Leo Zulueta, Bill Salmon, and Vyvyn Lazonga, among others. Angry Women was an influential feminist book, and it was read in many college classes. It included interviews with Diamanda Galas, Lydia Lunch, Karen Finley, Susie Bright, Annie Sprinkle, Kathy Acker, bell hooks, and Wanda Coleman. Freaks explored \\"circus freak\\" culture, while Bob Flanagan: Supermasochist profiled Bob Flanagan, a masochist with cystic fibrosis. Furthermore, RE/Search book explored \\"weird\\" culture. Incredibly Strange Films helped introduce audiences to Russ Meyer and Herschell Gordon Lewis. Incredibly Strange Music helped introduce audiences to Yma Sumac and Ken Nordine. In later publications, RE/Search explored topics such as artificial intelligence, Burning Man, and Timothy Leary. RE/Search was the subject of a special issue of the European Journal of American Studies (August 2011, Vol. 30 issue 2), including an examination of \\"the growth and decline of RE/Search as a commercial enterprise dedicated to documenting and, in effect, marketing selected countercultural trends.\\" Both artist and musician Florian- Ayala Fauna and science fiction author Bruce Sterling are sponsors for the RE/Search newsletter.  Influence  RE/Search books have influenced many writers, activists, and artists. Michelle Tea cited Angry Women as an early inspiration for her. The book Modern Primitives \\"... changed countless lives, bringing what had been a localized and niche set of body modification practices, aesthetics and philosophies out of San Francisco to a global audience, dominating scholarly and popular discourse around body modification subculture for more than a decade afterwards,\\" as written in European Journal of American Culture (2011). Jello Biafra has also called Modern Primitives an influential book. Select bibliographySearch & Destroy= * Search & Destroy #1‚Äì11: Tabloid format zine.

Work In his PhD dissertation (in Mathematics, at ETH Zurich, 1951; published in 1954), B√∂hm describes for the first time a full meta-circular compiler, that is a translation mechanism of a programming language, written in that same language. His most influential contribution is the so-called structured program theorem, published in 1966 together with Giuseppe Jacopini. In lambda calculus, he established an important separation theorem between normal forms. Together with Alessandro Berarducci, he demonstrated an isomorphism between the strictly-positive algebraic data types and the polymorphic lambda-terms, otherwise known as B√∂hm‚ÄìBerarducci encoding.http://okmij.org/ftp/tagless- final/course/Boehm-Berarducci.html A special issue of Theoretical Computer Science was dedicated to him in 1993, on his 70th birthday.

A native of Berrysburg, Pennsylvania, Bergstresser was born on June 25, 1858. Bergstresser graduated from Lafayette College, where he took a scientific course and Latin, in 1881.

This unrest was provoked by the arrest of Mohamed Nasheed - an open critic of the president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom - and the subsequent demolition of the Dhunfini tent, used by the members of the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) for their gatherings. Supporters of MDP were quick to demonstrate. They started calling for the resignation of Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, soon after Nasheed's arrest. Several arrests were made on the first night followed by the demolition of the Dhunfini tent. The demolition complicated the situation further provoking the unrest. The unrest grew violent on the third night, on August 14, 2005, due to the methods used in the attempts by the authority to stop the demonstration. The unrest continued intermittently for three nights, from August 12 to August 14, 2005. By August 15, 2005, the uprising was controlled with the presence of heavy security around Mal√©. Almost a fourth of the city had to be cordoned off during the unrest. Mohamed Nasheed's arrest On August 12, 2005, to mark the first anniversary of the Black Friday, members of the Maldivian Democratic Party and pro reformists started gathering near Republican Square. Despite heavy police and National Security Service (NSS) presence, at around 4:30pm local time Mohamed Nasheed along with other several leading members of the party, decided to gather at Republican square. Security was tight around Mal√© due to the obvious perceptibility of such a demonstration to mark this anniversary. Two days before, on August 10, 2005, NSS announced that they will be conducting a huge training in Mal√© for four days, starting from August 11, 2005. Despite heavy police presence, Mohamed Nasheed decided to sit right in the center of the Republican square with his colleagues. Minutes later he was approached by a team of Maldives Police Service. They approached him and asked him to simply \\"go away\\" from there. Nasheed demanded to know why he was asked to leave while he is not committing anything illegal. The leader of this team responded by saying such gatherings are illegal and they will have to remove him by force if not obeyed within five minutes. To this ultimatum, Nasheed responded by saying. \\"You will give us five minutes, after that what? You will beat us to death?\\" At one time Nasheed asked the police to join them, since he is not inciting violence but peacefully sitting there. Since he refused to leave the spot, the police team moved towards the flag pole few meters away. At around 4:23 p.m., riot police moved into Republican Square. Soon they surrounded Mohamed Nasheed and other members of the party present with him. Nasheed and his colleagues still refused to leave the area. Members of riot then forcefully removed them and taken into nearby NSS headquarters. Footage of this event was obtained by Minivan News, run from outside the country. Along with Nasheed and shortly after that, several others were arrested. * Jennifer Latheef * Latheefa Umar * Aminath Shareef * Ahmed Abbas * Aminath Shareef Demolition of the Dhunfini tent Before Nasheed's arrest several members of the MDP went to Dhunfini Haruge (a large tent where MDP conducts most of its activities) for Black Friday remembrance as previously planned. The arrest of Nasheed was instantly learnt by the people present at Dhunfini tent. They started calling for the resignation and the immediate unconditional release of Nasheed in addition to their speeches to mark the Black Friday. When Nasheed was arrested his supporters near Republican Square expressed their discontent over the matter. Within two hours of his arrest his supporters were on the roads near the Republican Square shouting anti- government chants. By 9:30 p.m., they gathered behind the parliament building with banners calling for the release of people detained earlier. After sometime rallied towards the Dhunfini Haruge. The crowd at Dhunfini vowed not to leave the tent until the government released the members of MDP. On the early morning of August 13, 2005, police raided Dhunfini Haruge (MDP meeting point) and demolished the stage, podium and destroyed the speaking facilities, claiming that they had found weapons (sharpened iron rods) on the premises. Police cordoned off several areas in the capital of Mal√©, around the National Security Services, Shaheed Ali Building (Police Headquarters), Republic Square, People's Majlis and Maldivian Democratic Party Headquarters. More arrests Several arrests were made during the morning hours of August 13, 2005, to prevent further demonstrations. Some key people arrested included: * Shuaib Ali (Furahani)- Democracy campaigner and MDP National Council Member * Ali Shiyam - Director of AAA Resorts * Mohamed Ziyad - MDP Councillor Unrest Protesters By late afternoon, around 3:00 p.m. on August 13, 2005, MDP members started gathering outside MDP Headquarters - area that was held by the police. By 7:00 p.m. local time the crowd had turned into a large demonstration. This crowd was dispersed by the police using pepper spray. By about 7:45 p.m. the crowd, once again re-assembled on Majeedhee Magu (one of the main roads in the capital) demanding the immediate release of their Chairman Mohamed Nasheed. Riot police arrived on the scene to disperse the demonstrators, but they held off calling for the immediate resignation of President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. The police used various methods including baton charges, tear gas, pepper spray and high pressure water cannons on the crowd throughout the night. Police arrested several demonstrators, whom by 11:00 p.m. had turned to throwing stones on the riot control policemen. The mob grew violent as the police tried to stop them. There were reported casualties of both police and civilians. On August 14, 2005, a curfew was declared starting from midnight to 4:30 a.m. in Mal√©. Despite the curfew, people refused to go home. The police controlled the situation by 1:00 am with more arrests. In the morning of August 14, 2005 more people were arrested including CHSE chemistry teacher Imad Solih and Abdul Majid, MDP member and a businessman. The third night of the demonstration, second night of the unrest, started after Ishaa prayers on August 14, 2005. Street protest began in Mal√© at 7:30 p.m. near Athamaa Palace - a hotel. This turned to be the most violent of three nights. An angry mob confronted the riot police with petrol-soaked burning tennis balls, bricks, stones and other objects. The unrest was controlled by 1:30 am of August 15, 2005. By the third night some 160 people were arrested and transferred, reportedly, to Feydhoo Finolhu - an uninhabited island of Mal√© Atoll - and Girifushi (an island used by the military for training purposes). Both NSS and Police were accused of verbally abusing the crowd, throughout the unrest, which fueled the violence further. On one incident they were accused of storming into a mosque and verbally abusing the people praying. On the other incident it was reported a pregnant women, Aminath Massha, was beaten by NSS personnel. NSS denied these accusations on state owned television, Television Maldives, saying they had not beaten up any pregnant women nor had they stormed into the mosque. The opposition has criticized the government of provoking the public, and then using it as a means to arrest senior figures within the opposition to suppress the political activities. Unrest in other atolls Unrest also broke out in Gaafu Dhaalu Atoll and Addu Atoll following Mohamed Nasheed's arrest.

His term focused on reforming the operations of the state government and overseeing the state's contributions for World War I. He nearly died twice during his term, and spent a considerable time bedridden. Following his term as governor, he became increasingly wealthy from his business interests and owned a controlling share in many companies. Early lifeFamily and background= James Putnam Goodrich was born on February 18, 1864 in Winchester, Indiana, the son of John Baldwin and Elizabeth Edger Goodrich. His father was an attorney and suffered from tuberculosis; he died in 1872. Goodrich attended public schools and intended to enter the US Naval Academy. He earned an appointment to the school, but he suffered a severe hip injury after falling out of a tree ending his prospect for a career in the military and forcing him to decline the offer.Gugin, p. 250 Goodrich taught in Randolph County public schools for two years to save money for college. He then enrolled in DePauw University, where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. In college he became friends with Albert J. Beveridge who influenced him to be involved in politics. After attending college for two years, he was forced to quit for lack of funds, and began to study law with Enos Watson, the father of his classmate James E. Watson.Gugin, p. 251 =Party leader= Admitted to the bar in 1887, Goodrich practiced law in Winchester and quickly gained prominence in Republican politics. He was involved in a variety of organizations including the Knights of Labor, the Grange Movement, Knights of Pythias, and the Republican Party. In 1897 he became chairman of the Randolph County Republican Party and was later elevated to serve as state chairman from 1901 to 1910 and a national committeeman from 1912 to 1916. His time in party leadership was difficult for him as the party was wracked by a growing internal division over various progressive agenda items. Charles W. Fairbanks was trying to lead the party to the right, while Albert J. Beveridge was trying to pull the party to the left. Despite Goodrich's attempts to heal the division, the conflict between the two men split the party in 1912, as the progressive wing left to form a new party.Gugin, p. 252 In 1910, he moved his law practice to Indianapolis. His investments in farms, grain elevators, coal mines and banks made him wealthy. For the next five years he spent his time working in his law practice and overseeing his business interests. He returned to active politics again in 1915 when he announced he would run for governor. Indiana had just begun implementing its new primary method of electing candidates, and removing candidate selection by convention. He defeated Warren T. McCray and Quincy A. Meyers by over 50,000 votes to win the nomination. GovernorTax reform= In the general election, the campaign focused primarily on prohibition and tax reforms of the previous administrations. He defeated Democrat John A. M. Adair in the November election by plurality. Goodrich's primary goal was to bring \\"efficiency and economy\\" to the government. Almost all of the state's primary source of revenue came through property tax which was seen as unfairly targeting farmers and the rural parts of the state. In 1917 Goodrich tried to have a constitutional convention called to amend the Constitution of Indiana to allow excise taxes to be imposed.Gugin, p. 253 Opponents of the tax lobbied the Indiana General Assembly to kill the excise tax bills. The General Assembly approved the constitutional convention but the opponents took the measure to court. The Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the legislature had no constitutional authority to call a convention, and that a convention could only be called if approved by popular vote. Earlier court decisions had stated the legislature also had no power to amend the constitution, effectively creating a narrow and difficult path for amendment. The decision ended the attempted imposition of new taxes but started a movement that succeeded in later years. Although he could not have excise taxes legalized, he did succeed in having legislation passed in 1919 to standardize property tax assessment across the state and grant the State Board of Tax Commissioners power to override local assessments, which effectively led to higher property values being attributed to city properties to ensure that the rural part of the state was no longer paying the majority of the state's revenues. =World War I= Goodrich began several measures to reform the civil service. He began by attempting to eliminate the patronage system. He eliminated numerous positions by not hiring anyone to fill them, but his plans were soon prevented by the need to grow the state government to manage the recruitment for World War I, which the United States entered in 1917. That state sent over 130,000 troops in its largest deployment since the American Civil War. At least 3,354 soldiers were killed or died from disease in the war. As a percentage of the population, this was higher than any other state. Goodrich's marketing of war bonds was extremely successful, leading other states to copy his techniques.Gugin, p. 254 Governor James P. Goodrich signs the Indiana prohibition act, 1917. In August 1917, he contracted typhoid after touring a prison in northern Indiana. The sickness left him bedridden for two months, bordering on death several times. He was nursed back to health in the Indianapolis Methodist Hospital. He did not return to the statehouse until November, but had to deal with several issues, including coal shortages, from his home. He created a commission led by Will Hays to assist him in organizing and directing the state's resources. In the spring of 1918, Goodrich was driving home after attending a military send-off when he was struck by a streetcar. The accident was very serious and he suffered bone fractures in his hip, skull, ribs, and collarbone. He was again near death, but survived. The accident left him greatly weakened and he was forced to walk with a cane for the rest of his life. =Amendments= During 1919, the United States Congress passed the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, banning the sale of liquor, and the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, granting women the right to vote. At the passage of each amendment, Goodrich called a special one-day legislative session to have the amendments ratified by the state. When he signed the 18th Amendment into law, Indiana became the final state needed to add it to the federal constitution, beginning national prohibition. Among Goodrich's other accomplishments in office were the creation of a state highway commission, creation of a department of conservation on the heels of the development of state parks (at the behest of his close friend Richard Lieber), and approval for the creation of the Indiana World War Memorial. He called a one-day session of the legislature on January 16, 1920, to ratify the Women's Suffrage Amendment to the United States Constitution.Gugin, p. 256 Later life In 1920, Goodrich was Indiana's favorite son candidate for the Republican nomination for president, losing to Senator Warren G. Harding. As president, Harding appointed Goodrich to the Russian Relief Commission. Goodrich made four trips to Russia, then governed by the Bolshevik regime of Vladimir Lenin, and gained a reputation as one of America's best-informed observers of conditions there. Goodrich also served in Herbert Hoover's American Relief Administration and on the St. Lawrence Waterway Commission. He remained active in Republican Party politics and made large donations from his personal fortune to Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, where he served on the board of trustees.Gugin, p. 257 He became increasingly wealthy in his later life from his business investments. He successfully founded a business empire that lasted nearly a century. By the time of his death he owned a major stake in Central Newspapers, and held controlling interests in the Indiana Telephone Company, Goodrich Brothers' Company, City Securities and a host of smaller businesses. He died on August 15, 1940 at the Randolph County Hospital in Winchester, Indiana, after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage. He is buried in Fountain Park Cemetery in Winchester. Goodrich Hall at Wabash College was named in his honor.Gugin, p. 258 Electoral historySee also *List of Governors of Indiana References Notes Bibliography * External links * Indiana Historical Bureau: Biography and portrait * National Governors Association - Goodrich Bio *James Goodrich at FindAGrave Category:1864 births Category:1940 deaths Category:Governors of Indiana Category:People from Winchester, Indiana Category:DePauw University alumni Category:Indiana Republicans Category:American Presbyterians Category:Republican Party state governors of the United States ","title":"James P.

He was made famous as the eccentric character Siegfried Farnon in the semi-autobiographical books of James Herriot (Alf Wight), adapted for film and television as All Creatures Great and Small.  Royal Air Force service  23 Kirkgate, Thirsk, Yorkshire, now the World of James Herriot museum In 1939, Sinclair bought a veterinary practice at 23 Kirkgate, Thirsk, Yorkshire, and he hired Wight to run it in July 1940 while Sinclair was undertaking his war service in the Royal Air Force. However, Sinclair had deliberately misrepresented himself as being younger than he was in order to join up, and it was quickly discovered that his reflexes were not fast enough for him to continue with pilot training. He could have been redeployed within the service, but the fact that he was a veterinary surgeon meant that he was considered more useful to the war effort by resuming his peacetime profession. The severe national food shortage meant that proper veterinary treatment of farm animals received a high priority, and so within four months of joining the RAF he received a compulsory discharge and he returned to Thirsk.  Literary caricature  The fictional character Siegfried Farnon is portrayed as outspoken, opinionated, bossy, quick to lose his temper, and also quick to blow over. He is nonetheless basically good-hearted and an animal lover, fond of riding, and infuriated by any suspicion of deliberate cruelty to animals. One recurrent theme in Herriot's stories was Siegfried's criticism of James's flaws, such as forgetting appointments or leaving tools behind after calls, only for the reader to find that Siegfried is found guilty of the same things. When Wight's first book was published, Sinclair was offended by his portrayal and said, \\"Alfred, this book is a real test of our friendship.\\" (He never called Wight \\"Alf\\", mirrored in the books by Siegfried always referring to Herriot as \\"James\\" rather than \\"Jim\\".) Things calmed down, however, and the pair continued to work together until they retired. Wight's son stated in The Real James Herriot that Sinclair's character in the novels was considerably toned down, and that Sinclair was even more eccentric than the Herriot books portrayed. Robert Hardy, who played the role of Siegfried Farnon in the television series, went to visit Sinclair prior to playing him, and subsequently became friends with him. However, Hardy reminisced that Sinclair hated the way that Hardy played him, because, as Hardy claimed, Sinclair was wholly unaware of his own eccentricities.  Death  Sinclair took his own life by an overdose of barbiturate on 28 June 1995 at his home Southwoods Hall, near Thirsk, two weeks after the death of his wife Audrey (n√©e Adamson), to whom he had been married for 53 years. His brother Brian (Tristan in the books) had died several years earlier, and his friend and partner Alf Wight only four months previously.

Silvery-cheeked hornbills are residents of the tall evergreen forests of East Africa from Ethiopia to South Africa. In Zimbabwe it is threatened by habitat destruction and its presence in South Africa is marginal, but it remains locally fairly common, especially in the northern and central parts of its range.  Description  It measures in length, and has a very large cream-colored casque on the beak. The head is silver-grey and the rest of the plumage is iridescent black, except for the white rump, lower back, thighs, vent and tip of the outer tail-feathers. The sexes are similar except the female has a smaller casque and reddish skin around the eyes.  Diet  It is omnivorous, feeding on fruits, insects, small birds, rodents, small reptiles and centipedes.  Behaviour  Usually they live in pairs and sometimes roost in flocks of hundreds of individuals. They breed in spring (September and October; at least in part of its range) and lay clutches of one to three white eggs, incubated for 40 days. The young remain with both parents for about 80 days.

Properties  A set X is transitive if and only if \\\\bigcup X \\\\subseteq X, where \\\\bigcup X is the union of all elements of X that are sets, \\\\bigcup X = \\\\\\\\{y \\\\mid \\\\exists x \\\\in X: y \\\\in x\\\\\\\\}. If X is transitive, then \\\\bigcup X is transitive. If X and Y are transitive, then X‚à™Y‚à™{X,Y} is transitive. In general, if X is a class all of whose elements are transitive sets, then X \\\\cup \\\\bigcup X is transitive. A set X that does not contain urelements is transitive if and only if it is a subset of its own power set, X \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{P}(X). The power set of a transitive set without urelements is transitive.  Transitive closure  The transitive closure of a set X is the smallest (with respect to inclusion) transitive set that contains X. Suppose one is given a set X, then the transitive closure of X is :\\\\operatorname{TC}(X) = \\\\bigcup \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ X,\\\\; \\\\bigcup X,\\\\; \\\\bigcup\\\\bigcup X,\\\\; \\\\bigcup\\\\bigcup\\\\bigcup X,\\\\; \\\\bigcup\\\\bigcup\\\\bigcup\\\\bigcup X, \\\\ldots\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Proof. Denote X_0 = X and X_{n+1} = \\\\bigcup X_n. Then we claim that the set :T = \\\\operatorname{TC}(X) = \\\\bigcup_{n=0}^\\\\infty X_n is transitive, and whenever T_1 is a transitive set containing X then T \\\\subseteq T_1. Assume y \\\\in x \\\\in T. Then x \\\\in X_n for some n and so y \\\\in \\\\bigcup X_n = X_{n+1}. Since X_{n+1} \\\\subseteq T, y \\\\in T. Thus T is transitive. Now let T_1 be as above. We prove by induction that X_n \\\\subseteq T_1 for all n, thus proving that T \\\\subseteq T_1: The base case holds since X_0 = X \\\\subseteq T_1. Now assume X_n \\\\subseteq T_1. Then X_{n+1} = \\\\bigcup X_n \\\\subseteq \\\\bigcup T_1. But T_1 is transitive so \\\\bigcup T_1 \\\\subseteq T_1 whence X_{n+1} \\\\subseteq T_1. This completes the proof. Note that this is the set of all of the objects related to X by the transitive closure of the membership relation, since the union of a set can be expressed in terms of the relative product of the membership relation with itself. Transitive models of set theory Transitive classes are often used for construction of interpretations of set theory in itself, usually called inner models. The reason is that properties defined by bounded formulas are absolute for transitive classes. A transitive set (or class) that is a model of a formal system of set theory is called a transitive model of the system (provided that the element relation of the model is the restriction of the true element relation to the universe of the model). Transitivity is an important factor in determining the absoluteness of formulas. In the superstructure approach to non-standard analysis, the non- standard universes satisfy strong transitivity.Goldblatt (1998) p.161 See also *End extension *Transitive relation *Supertransitive class  References    External links   Category:Set theory ","title":"Transitive set"},{"id":"2462402","text":"Steamboat River Minnesota State Highway 371 (MN 371) is a highway in central and north-central Minnesota. The route connects Minnesota's northern lakes region with the central part of the state. It runs south‚Äìnorth from U.S. Highway 10 (US 10) in Little Falls to US 2 in Cass Lake. MN 371 has become a heavily traveled arterial route that was once a two-lane roadway over almost all of its length, but has been widened to four lanes across most of its southern half. Much of the traffic utilizing the route is Twin Cities-based traffic heading to their cabins on one of the many northern lakes. Route description MN 371 serves as a south‚Äìnorth route in central and north- central Minnesota between Little Falls, Baxter, Brainerd, Nisswa, Pequot Lakes, Walker, and Cass Lake. Highway 371 departs from US 10 at Little Falls heading to the north, paralleling the Mississippi River on the east side of the river. MN 371 is a freeway-standard route coming off of US 10 as it passes on the west side of the industrial sector of Little Falls. The first interchange heading northbound is with Morrison County Road 46 (CR 46), which is the only interchange within the Little Falls area for the freeway portion. After Little Falls the route enters rural farmland, which will characterize the rest of the freeway portion of the route. The next interchange for Highway 371 is near the Fort Ripley military base where it meets MN 115 and CR 47 at a diamond interchange. MN 115 serves the military base to the west; a large tank used as a monument is located on the east side of the interchange. It formerly sat on the west side of Highway 371 before the interchange with Highway 115 was built in the early 2000s. This interchange with Highway 115 was the final piece to be completed in the Highway 371 freeway upgrade. The Highway 371 freeway ends a few miles north of Highway 115 at CR 48, but maintains a four- lane divided highway configuration. North of CR 48, Highway 371 crosses into Crow Wing County and enters the town of Fort Ripley, spending a short time passing through the center of the small town. The highway quickly leaves Fort Ripley and continues north as the landscape steadily becomes less farm- oriented and more forested. After Fort Ripley the highway turns to the northeast for several miles and clips the southeast corner of Crow Wing State Park. A few more miles to the northeast, Highway 371 intersects Business Highway 371; this is the Brainerd exit. In the year 2000, Highway 371 was moved onto the C. Elmer Anderson Memorial Highway, which bypasses Brainerd to the west, and the old roadway into downtown Brainerd was redesignated Business Highway 371. Highway 371 itself turns back to the north and crosses the Mississippi River before entering Baxter, a smaller city just to the west of Brainerd. In Baxter, MN 371 intersects MN 210, another major arterial route for northern Minnesota. Highway 371 heads north through the business district of Baxter, then enters the Gull Lake area, a popular tourist destination. Highway 371 crosses an intersection with CR 77 and CR 48\\\\. CR 77 is a three- quarter loop around Gull Lake to the west, while Highway 371 makes up the eastern quarter. Highway 371 passes north past several lakes along with many resorts, and reaches the town of Nisswa at a junction with CR 77 and CR 13; CR 13 goes into Nisswa, while CR 77 will take one back around Gull Lake to the west. Highway 371 remains as a four lane divided highway, as the landscape becomes noticeably more forested. The next town on the route is Pequot Lakes, most famous for its fishing bobber water tower. Highway 371 exceeds freeway standards from the intersection with CR 107 to the intersection with CR 112 and Patriot Avenue. Right after the intersection with CR 16, Highway 371 turns into a two lane road (one lane in each direction). The road leaves the otherwise small town behind quickly. Several miles north of Pequot Lakes and after passing through the small town of Jenkins, MN 371 enters Cass County. The forested landscape subsides for a short while as Highway 371 comes to the town of Pine River, the largest town on the route between Brainerd and Walker, and here Highway 371 intersects the southern terminus of MN 84\\\\. Highway 84 heads to the northeast to Chickamaw Beach and Longville while Highway 371 continues due north. The forests return as Highway 371 reaches the town of Backus, located on Pine Mountain Lake, where it meets MN 87 for a short concurrency. After Highway 87 splits off to the east just past Backus Airport, Highway 371 heads into rural forest for about , broken only by the small town of Hackensack before reaching MN 200 just south of Walker, a regionally important city in northern Minnesota. Highway 371 and Highway 200 begin an concurrency at this intersection; Highway 371 north and Highway 200 west continue to the northwest together as they pass around Walker Bay, the western arm of Leech Lake, one of the largest lakes in Minnesota. The two pass the former Ah-gwah-ching facility, which was serviced by the unsigned MN 290\\\\. Highway 371 and Highway 200 concurrently reach downtown Walker, a town where travelers can find most amenities. Also in Walker is the eastern terminus of MN 34, which provides the main route between Walker, Park Rapids, and Detroit Lakes to the west. Several miles northwest of Walker, Highway 200 splits off Highway 371, heading west towards Lake Itasca while Highway 371 stays heading north. Highway 371 will not intersect any more state highways on its mainline routing after this intersection. Meanwhile, the landscape now becomes less treelined and more hilly as the route progresses towards Cass Lake, the final city on Highway 371. The route enters Cass Lake from the south, passes through downtown and ends at U.S. Highway 2 just north of downtown, although the roadway itself continues north as a local street. =Memorial designations= * On August 7, 2006, the highway was dedicated as the Purple Heart Memorial Highway in honor of veterans who have been wounded or died in combat. * Most of Highway 371, except for the Brainerd bypass, is also officially designated the Paul Bunyan Expressway. This is a unique name designation because the portion of Highway 371 from Pequot Lakes to Cass Lake is not built to expressway standards. * The portion of Highway 371 bypass around Brainerd is officially designated the C. Elmer Anderson Memorial Highway. =State Park= Crow Wing State Park is located near Highway 371 at the confluence of the Mississippi and Crow Wing Rivers. The park is located nine miles south of Brainerd and Baxter. The park entrance is located one mile west of the junction of Highway 371 and County Road 27. The entrance is on County Road 27.Minnesota DNR website for Crow Wing State Park History Minnesota 371 was originally designated as US 371 from 1931 to 1973. During 1973, US 371 was re-designated Minnesota 371. The former US 371 designation was concurrent with US 2 from 1931 to 1973 between Cass Lake and Bemidji with a terminus at US 71\\\\. Subsequently, US 371 was recycled and reassigned to a concatenation of state highways in Arkansas and Louisiana to form a new US 371 in 1994. The current US 371 has no relationship to the old US 371 (now Minnesota 371) other than being associated with US 71 as the parent number. =Improvements= For the most part Highway 371 has been a high-volume, two-lane highway. Because of increases in traffic, especially during times of peak recreational demand, Highway 371 has been the focus of many highway upgrades in the area: * In 2005, the remaining segment of the project that converted Highway 371 to a four-lane expressway from Little Falls to Baxter was completed. This project included a bypass of Brainerd, which opened in the year 2000. The old route through Brainerd is now bannered as Highway 371 Business. * Plans are also in the works to upgrade the segment of Highway 371 from Nisswa to Pine River to a four-lane expressway. No date has been announced for its continued expansion as of May 2020. Highway 371 Business Before the opening of the Brainerd bypass in the year 2000, Old Highway 371 went through downtown Brainerd and then proceeded west on a two-mile (3 km) concurrency with Highway 210 before resuming north at its current intersection in Baxter. Due to the addition of new highway mileage from the new bypass, the old route of Highway 371 was a candidate for turnback to local jurisdiction. Because of local preference to keep the old routing of Highway 371 as part of the state trunk highway system, it was agreed that portions of other highways in the surrounding area would be turnbacked instead: MN 18 from MN 210 to MN 25, and the two-block long MN 322 would be given to the city of Brainerd maintenance, and MN 25 north of MN 210 to its terminus at Merrifield would be given to Crow Wing County maintenance as an extension of CR 3\\\\.

The eyes are brown or red, with pink surrounding skin. Body mass is between .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . It is similar to silvery-cheeked hornbill. Distinguishing features include an all-black back, white belly and white underwing coverts (in flight, wings present white tips), and red facial skin. The trumpeter hornbill is a gregarious bird, usually living in groups of two to five individuals, although sometimes as many as fifty. This hornbill is a locally common resident of the tropical evergreen forests of Burundi, Mozambique, Botswana, Congo, Kenya, the Caprivi strip of Namibia and eastern South Africa, where it feeds on fruits and large insects. Like other hornbills, the females incubate four to five white eggs while sealed in the nest compartment.  Aviculture  When they are kept and fed in captivity, they are tame, loving birds that can be taught a variety of tricks and enjoy companionship with their owner. They require large, spacious cages to move about in because of their active nature. Care is needed with their high fruit diet because of their susceptibility to excessive iron storage (similar to the excessive iron storage seen in the disease hemochromatosis in humans). They are very intelligent and have a life expectancy of up to 20 years. Widespread throughout its large range, the trumpeter hornbill is evaluated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

An isochromosome is an unbalanced structural abnormality in which the arms of the chromosome are mirror images of each other. The chromosome consists of two copies of either the long (q) arm or the short (p) arm because isochromosome formation is equivalent to a simultaneous duplication and deletion of genetic material. Consequently, there is partial trisomy of the genes present in the isochromosome and partial monosomy of the genes in the lost arm. Nomenclature An isochromosome can be abbreviated as i(chromosome number and arm). For example, an isochromosome of chromosome 17 containing two q arms can be identified as i(17q).(Medulloblastoma) Mechanism Isochromosomes can be created during mitosis and meiosis through a misdivision of the centromere or U-type strand exchange. Isochromosome formation through the misdivision of the centromere. Monocentric isochromosomes contain arms that are mirror images of each other. =Centromere misdivision= Under normal separation of sister chromatids in metaphase, the centromere will divide longitudinally, or parallel to the long axis of the chromosome. An isochromosome is created when the centromere is divided transversely, or perpendicular to the long axis of the chromosome. The division is usually not occurring in the centromere itself, but in an area surrounding the centromere, also known as a pericentric region. It is proposed that these sites of exchange contain homologous sequences between sister chromatids. Although the resulting chromosome may appear monocentric with only one centromere, it is isodicentric with two centromeres very close to each other; resulting in a potential loss of genetic material found on the other arms. Misdivision of the centromere can also produce monocentric isochromosomes, but they are not as common as dicentric isochromosomes. =U-type strand exchange= A more common mechanism in the formation of isochromosomes is through the breakage and fusion of sister chromatids, most likely occurring in early anaphase of mitosis or meiosis. A double-stranded break in the pericentric region of the chromosome is repaired when the sister chromatids, each containing a centromere, are fused together. This U-type exchange of genetic material creates an isodicentric chromosome. Misdivision of the centromere and U-type exchange can occur in sister chromatids, thus creating an isochromosome with genetically identical arms. However, U-type exchange can also occur for homologous chromosomes which creates an isochromosome with homologous arms. This exchange between homologues is most likely due to homologous sequences containing low copy repeats. Regardless of the chromosome involved in U-type exchange, the acentric fragment of the chromosome is lost, thus creating a partial monosomy of genes located in that portion of the acentric chromosome. Consequences The most common isochromosome is the X sex chromosome. Acrocentric autosomal chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 are also common candidates for isochromosome formation. Chromosomes containing smaller arms are more likely to become isochromosomes because the loss of genetic material in those arms can be tolerated. =Turner syndrome= Turner syndrome is a condition in females in which there is partial or complete loss of one X chromosome. This causes symptoms such as growth and sexual development problems. In 15% of Turner syndrome patients, the structural abnormality is isochromosome X, which is composed of two copies of the q arm (i(Xq)). A majority of i(Xq) are created by U-type strand exchange. A breakage and reunion in the pericentric region of the p arm results in a dicentric isochromosome. Some of the p arm can be found in this formation of i(Xq), but a majority of the genetic material on the p arm is lost so it is considered absent. Since the p-arm of the X chromosome contains genes that are necessary for normal sexual development, Turner's syndrome patients experience phenotypic effects. Alternatively, the increase in dosage of genes on the q arm may be involved in a 10-fold increase in risk of i(Xq) Turner's patients developing autoimmune thyroiditis, a disease in which the body creates antibodies to target and destroy thyroid cells. =Neoplasia= Neoplasia is uncontrolled cell growth, resulting in the creation of a tumour. In many different forms of neoplasia, isochromosome 17q is the most frequent neoplasia associated isochromosome and corresponds with poor patient survival. Unique DNA sequences, known as low copy repeats, occur in the pericentric region of the p arm, so a crossover event in that area can create a dicentric isochromosome through U-type strand exchange. The neoplasia created from i(17q) is caused by a decrease and increase in gene dosage from the monosomy of the p arm and trisomy of the q arm, respectively. Many candidate tumour suppressor genes are found on the lost p arm, allowing the tumour cell population to be maintained. It is debated whether the loss of tumour suppressor gene p53, located on 17p, is involved in the central pathogenesis of some neoplasia. The presence of one p53 gene can be functionally active, but its relation to other oncogenes can alter its expression levels when present only in one copy. Since the genetic sequences involved in i(17q) neoplasia are large, it is difficult to determine which genes, or combination of genes, are involved in tumour growth.

He is known for his frightening drawing style and humorous writings. His works have been shown in art galleries as well as appearing guerrilla style on the streets. Biography Neck Face grew up in a large family being the second youngest out of a total of five brothers and for a time lived in Mexico. Two of his brothers ran a graffiti shop where he spent a lot of time. The rest of his brothers worked at his father's tire shop. He began tagging in Stockton, California during his junior year in high school. From 1998 to 2002, Neck Face attended Bear Creek High School and Tokay High School. Neck Face claims he gained most of his art knowledge during elementary school, saying, \\"I think I learned more in school in the earlier years than the later years. I think if you are a teacher, you should teach the kid as much as you can in the beginning years of school.\\" He gained notoriety through his self-made stickers throughout nearby towns of Stockton and Lodi, California, where his works first showed up on public objects. Later, as his graffiti techniques evolved, his work spread to San Francisco, where his name can still be seen on many newspaper stands and walls throughout the city. While attending high school Neck Face thought that he could never go to post-secondary school with his low SAT scores but the girlfriend of one of his brothers told him he could apply to Art Universities. Stunned at this news he applied to two universities, California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) in Valencia, California and School of Visual Arts (SVA) in Manhattan, New York. He applied to these two as they only looked at portfolios not SAT scores. In 2002 he started at SVA and attended for two years before dropping out. The attention Neck Face received from his street work allowed him to move his work off the streets and into the art galleries. Galleries that have shown his artwork include the New Image Art Gallery in Los Angeles, the Luggage Store in San Francisco, One Grand Gallery in Portland, the Dactyl Foundation in New York, and the OHWOW Gallery in Miami. Artwork Neck Face tag on My Old Lady storefront Neck face piece on a van Neck Face's first gallery show was when he was 18-years-old and was sponsored by Rich Jacobs and held at New Image Art gallery in West Hollywood, California. Neck Face's style can be described as na√Øve and scratchy. His themes have a bloody, violent and medieval feel to them. Obvious influences are heavy metal and latrinalia. Gallery works follow Neck Face's familiar style but are not limited to drawings and paintings, shows have included sharp metal masks, felt installations, and sculptures. In an interview on Epicly Later'd, Neck Face describes using watercolors in his artwork as \\"I get the watercolor and then I just f*#k it up\\". In this same interview, he acknowledges King Diamond as a major influence. One public art piece appropriated the sign on an abandoned storefront of \\"My Old Lady\\" in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood; he painted under that \\"...‚ô•'s Neck Face\\". In 2005, to the displeasure of nearby residents and building superintendents, his work was prominently visible from the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. In 2011 Neck Face visited Bangkok, Thailand to do graffiti in the street. In addition to appearing across billboards and buildings in the United States, Neck Face's work can be seen internationally in places such as Melbourne, Sydney, Copenhagen, and Tokyo. =Commercial projects= His first skateboard art was for famous skateboarder Mark Gonzales. He approached a then 18-year-old Neck Face in New York and asked him to provide a design for a Krooked board. After his first board with Gonzales he was introduced to Kevin 'Spanky' Long and started to create boards for him and the Baker skateboard brand. He would later put Spanky in the hospital after lighting him on fire. As a skateboarder himself, Neck Face has helped design for Baker Skateboards, and is the Art Director for Baker Skateboards. Neck Face has also collaborated with Vans, St√ºssy and Altamont Apparel. There is an all-access documentary featuring Neck Face in the works that started as a long-term project in 2005 by director Ty Evans.

Life and career Friedman first became interested in entertainment after spending part of his childhood in Birmingham and Anniston, Alabama, traveling carnival sites. He worked as a film projectionist in Buffalo before serving in the US Army during the Second World War. He met exploitation film pioneer Kroger Babb during his army service. This encounter got him interested in films. He then worked as a regional marketing man for Paramount, and sensed the money in independent distributing. He started his own company in the 1950s, which mainly produced so-called nudie cutie films such as Goldilocks and The Three Bares, shot in nudist colonies, films that were the closest thing to pornography legally available at the time. This trend was followed by the sexploitation and \\"roughie\\" genres, depicting simulated sex with a more violent edge, often horror- or crime-related. Examples of Friedman's roughies are The Defilers (1965),Briggs (2003), p. 99 The Lustful Turk (1968), The Head Mistress (1968) and The Adult Version of Jekyll and Hide (1971, directed by Byron Mabe).Andrews (2006), p. 288 Helming one of those movies, Friedman started his working relationship with Chicago-based teacher and filmmaker Herschell Gordon Lewis. Friedman went on to produce the latter's 1963 film Blood Feast, an American exploitation film often considered the first \\"gore\\" or splatter film. He was also the producer of two of the first Nazi exploitation films, Love Camp 7 (1969)Andrews (2006), p. 63 and Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS (1974), for which he wouldn't use his real name and was credited as Herman Traeger.Briggs (2003), p. 174Suckling (2006), p. 83 With the advent of hardcore porn as a commercial factor in the mid-1970s, Friedman began to slow down his output. His motto was \\"Sell the sizzle not the steak\\" and he would not allow actual intercourse to be shown in his films. Still, he was president of the Adult Film Association of America, a trade association for hardcore porn producers.Andrews (2006), p. 61 In the early 1990s Seattle's Something Weird Video, owned by Mike Vraney, started to re-issue much of Friedman's work on videocassette, getting him the attention of a new generation of exploitation and b-movie collectors. He can be heard on the audio commentary track of some of the company's releases. In 1997, Friedman appeared in a lengthy segment of the feature-length documentary Hollywood Rated \\"R\\" and in the half-hour documentary David Friedman, Portrait of an Exploiteer, in the both of which he goes over his entire career and the history of exploitation films in America. In 2000 Friedman was featured alongside cult filmmakers Roger Corman, Doris Wishman, Harry Novak and others in the documentary SCHLOCK! The Secret History of American Movies, a film about the rise and fall of American exploitation cinema. In 1990 Friedman published his autobiography, A Youth in Babylon: Confessions of a Trash-Film King.David F. Friedman. A Youth in Babylon: Confessions of a Trash-Film King, Prometheus Books, 1998. . He remained proud of his cinematic oeuvre: ‚ÄúI made some terrible pictures, but I don‚Äôt make any apologies for anything I‚Äôve ever done. Nobody ever asked for their money back.‚Äù In 2001 he co-starred with longtime business partner Dan Sonney in the documentary Mau Mau Sex Sex (IMDb entry).

Founded in 1956 in Alberta, Canada by K.J. Miller, SafetyBoss set out to specialize in response to emergencies at oil production facilities, particularly oil wells. In 1979, K.J. Miller's son, Mike Miller took over the company. History Under the leadership of Mike Miller, Safety Boss expanded internationally through the 1980s, responding to oil well fires across the globe. =Smokey Fire Trucks= In 1983, Safety Boss developed a fire fighting vehicle designed with the sole function of attacking oil and natural gas production well fires. Its design was spurred by a destructive and difficult to extinguish oil well fire in Alberta. Called the 'Smoky Series' they have 3,000-gallon pumps, capacity for AR-AFFF Foam and purple 'K' dry chemical. In addition to firefighting abilities, the trucks are fitted with an emergency shower, and decontamination facilities. =Kuwait Oil Fires= In February 1991, Safety Boss took three of their Smokey Fire Trucks, and support equipment filling two C5 aircraft and departed for Kuwait to battle oil well fires started by retreating troops at the end of the Persian Gulf War. The retreating Iraqi forces had set approximately 670 oil wells alight. Safety Boss set the pace, extinguishing 180 fires, the most of any organization involved in the effort, and were responsible for extinguishing the final well fire, which was doused by the push of a button by the Emir of Kuwait. The Smoky Series fire trucks impressed the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) Fire Department, who offered to buy two of the Smokey fire trucks brought by Safety Boss as part of the effort for future emergencies. Safety Boss sold the trucks, Smokey 1 and 3, which as of 2017 are still in use by the KOC. =2000s Onward= As Safety Boss entered the 2000s, they expanded beyond just oil well firefighting, moving to also be a broader industrial safety company servicing more fields such as forestry, mining and hydro-electric, offering occupational safety training courses, first aid and rescue, air quality monitoring and staff drug testing.

History Historically, the Mattaponi River has been known by a variety of names and alternate spellings, including Mat- ta-pa-ment, Matapanient River, Matapany River, Matapeneugh River, Mattapanient River, Mattaponie River, Mattapony River, and Riviere de Mattapony. The current name and spelling of \\"Mattaponi\\" was set by official decisions of the United States Board on Geographic Names in 1897 and 1936. Residents of the counties surrounding Mattaponi River have debated a proposed reservoir on the Mattaponi River, with environmental groups such as the Sierra Club, members of the Mattaponi Indian tribe, and residents of King William County opposing Newport News Waterworks in their efforts to build the King William Reservoir. Course The Mattaponi River ultimately rises as four streams in Spotsylvania County, each of which is given a shorter piece of the Mattaponi's name: * The Mat River and the Ta River join in Spotsylvania County to form the Matta River; * The Po River and the Ni River join in Caroline County to form the Poni River; * The Matta River and the Poni River join in Caroline County to form the Mattaponi River. From the confluence of its tributaries, the Mattaponi flows generally southeast through Caroline County, where it collects the South River at the southern edge of the Mattaponi Wildlife Management Area; in its lower reaches it defines the boundary between King William and King and Queen counties. At West Point, it meets the Pamunkey River to form the York River.

It was popularised by the British satirical magazine Private Eye in 1967 after being used in a spoof diplomatic memo to describe the state of Labour Cabinet minister George Brown, but is now used as a stock phrase. The restraints of the parliamentary language also mean it is unacceptable in the House of Commons to accuse an MP of being drunk, but one may use this or other euphemisms such as not quite himself and overwrought. The Guardian describes the phrase as having joined those \\"that are part of every journalist's vocabulary\\". Because of this widespread interpretation, one source cautions professional British journalists against its use as \\"even if the journalist meant it literally\\", it could be considered defamatory. Origin The phrase may first be used in 1937, when Thomas Woodrooffe was described by the BBC as being in a \\"tired and emotional state\\". According to legend, Brown appeared on the BBC following the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, and a BBC presenter subsequently described him as \\"tired and emotional\\". In reality, Brown appeared on ITV, and although he was criticised for his apparent intoxication, no evidence of the phrase being broadcast has been found. It is also said to have its origin in a statement to the press by Brown's agent, Edward Eldred, who made excuses for him after he had behaved badly in public by saying that he was \\"tired and emotional\\". The phrase became associated with Brown, who already had a reputation for alcohol abuse. The Sunday Times wrote that \\"George Brown drunk is a better man than Harold Wilson sober\\", but The Independent said \\"Brown became a bit of a figure of fun, and, thanks to Private Eye favourite euphemism for his regular condition, he bequeathed the English language the expression 'tired and emotional'.\\" The 1993 biography by journalist Peter Paterson, which among other things described \\"his fondness for the bottle\\", was titled Tired and Emotional: The Life of Lord George Brown.  Usage  In 2002, Irish football analyst Eamon Dunphy appeared on RT√â, the Republic of Ireland's state broadcaster, during its coverage of the 2002 World Cup, and was taken off-air during the programme and suspended. Dunphy subsequently apologised to viewers, saying, \\"I arrived for work tired and emotional, I think is the euphemism. And I was tired. I'd had a few drinks. I hadn't slept and I think wasn't fit to fulfill my contract.\\" In 2004, Private Eye noted when The Sun newspaper, after an incident involving Prince Harry, then 20, quoted a \\"senior Clarence House source\\" as saying that Harry was \\"fired up. He'd been drinking and was tired and emotional.\\" BBC foreign affairs correspondent John Simpson described the \\"erratic\\" Serbian politician Vuk Dra≈°koviƒá as \\"tired and emotional\\" in a live news report from Belgrade broadcast on the UK evening news. He also used the term in relation to Dra≈°koviƒá in a BBC news article entitled \\"Change in the air in Belgrade\\". The Wall Street Journal used the euphemism in September 2010 to describe the Irish Taoiseach Brian Cowen after he was accused by Fine Gael politician Simon Coveney on Twitter of being \\"halfway between drunk and hung over\\" during an early morning radio interview.

They number approximately 1,750,000. They might include the Bassaries who live in northern Togo and the Northern Volta of Kingdom of Dagbon, Ghana. Gurma is also the name of a language spoken by the Gurma (or bigourmantcheba - as they call themselves) people, which is part of the Gur language family. See Gurmanchema language and Oti-Volta languages for related languages spoken by the Gurma. Overview Gurma weapon In 1985, Dr. Richard Alan Swanson wrote a book about these people, Gourmantch√© Ethnoanthropology: A Theory of Human Being. The book presents Gourmantch√© perception of 'human being' from the perspective of the people themselves, using their own language texts to illustrate concepts. Concepts of God (Otienu), destiny (licabili), the body (gbannandi), life (limiali), death (mikuuma), and all known terms for human body parts are also discussed. In 2006, in Burkina Faso, Salif Titamba Lankoande published a book on the History and Ethnography of the Gourmantch√© (‚ÄúLes Gourmantche‚Äù, Presses Africaines du Burkina, Ouagadougou, 2006, 211 p.). In 2012, the Portuguese Dr. Jo√£o Pedro Galhano Alves, published in Paris a book on the Gourmantch√© people and culture, and on the Ethnobiology of the coexistence among humans, lions and biodiversity in the region of the W of Niger, in Niger (\\"Anthropologie et √©cosyst√®mes au Niger. Humains, lions et esprits de la for√™t dans la culture gourmantch√© \\", Editions l‚ÄôHarmattan, Paris, 2012, 448 p.). Since 2005, he also published other books and several articles about this subject and about Gourmantch√© people. This publications are the result of research fieldwork made by the author in the W of Niger (Niger), between 2002 and 2010. Also, in 2010 and 2011, the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (Madrid, Spain), from the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas (Spain) presented a public exhibition mainly based on the research works of this Anthropologist and Ethnobiologist, showing his main data, analysis and concepts, a selection of his photographic archive and his collection of ethnographic and ethnobiological objects collected in several research fields; One part of this exhibition was about the Gourmantch√© culture and the coexistence among humans, lions and biodiversity in the W of Niger; The title of this exhibition was \\"Vivir en biodiversidad total con leones, tigres o lobos\\".

It is part of the for-profit Alliant International University where each campus's Clinical Psychology Psy.D. and Ph.D. program is individually accredited by the American Psychological Association. The school has trained approximately half of the licensed psychologists in California. The school has degree programs in clinical psychology, marriage and family therapy, clinical counseling, Organizational Psychology, and psychopharmacology at campuses in San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Fresno, Sacramento, and Irvine, and abroad in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Mexico City. CSPP is one of a handful of APA- accredited schools that also offered a clinical doctoral respecialization in professional psychology.  History  The California School of Professional Psychology (CSPP) was founded in 1969 under the auspices of the California Psychological Association. CSPP was the first free-standing school of professional psychology in the nation. The goal of CSPP is to train doctoral level psychologists in professional practice models and to assure that its students and faculty are as diverse as the State of California. At its founding CSPP, worked out of borrowed or rented space with a volunteer (unpaid) faculty, but had a large number of student applicants who were attracted to the new training model. The founding president of CSPP was Nick Cummings, PhD, who was succeeded by John O'Neill and subsequently by Judith Albino, PhD. (Mary Beth Kenkel, PhD and Rodney L. Lowman, PhD also served as interim presidents.) During the 2000s, under Albino's tenure, CSPP was renamed Alliant University and the four separately accredited campuses in Fresno, Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco were combined into a single WASC-accredited institution. The name was subsequently changed to Alliant International University after Alliant merged with (acquired the assets of) U.S. International University, based in San Diego. USIU was known for their faculty of humanistic psychologist that included Carl Rogers, Abraham Maslow, Victor Frankl, and Igor Ansoff. Today, CSPP is one of several schools that make up Alliant International University including a school of education, forensic psychology, a school of management and a law school. CSPP remains the largest of the schools. CSPP became accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) in 1977. By the mid-1980s all of its Clinical Psychology programs became accredited by the American Psychological Association and its Marriage and Family Therapy programs are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education of the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT).

Its overall length is , while its catchment surface is . Its average discharge is . The main tributary is Fan, flowing from the northeast, while the Mat flows from the southwest down to the confluence with Fan and then towards the Adriatic Sea. Etymology The Albanian name mat originally meant \\"elevated location\\", \\"mountain place\\". Today's meaning in Albanian, \\"river bank, river shore\\", is a consequence of a secondary change through the common use of both the terms mal, \\"mountain\\" and breg, \\"shore\\", giving the meaning of \\"elevation\\". The river was recorded by Roman writer Vibius Sequester (4th or 5th century AD) as Mathis, following a hellenized graphic mode of the term mat. It appeared in written records also as Mathia in 1380. Overview Hydrographic map of Albania Mat originates from the confluence of several streams within the karstic mountains in Martanesh, where it forms deep gorges and canyons. Rising in Martanesh, the Mat heads westwards to the municipality of Mat and northwest through the towns of Klos and Burrel. About downstream from Burrel, it flows into a large reservoir (Liqeni i Ulz√´s ‚Äì \\"Lake Ul√´z\\"). After passing through a hydroelectric dam, it flows through another, smaller reservoir (Liqeni i Shkopetit ‚Äì \\"Lake Shkopet\\") and forms a narrow gorge through the mountain range that separates Mat District from the coastal plains. It enters the plains between Milot and Zejmen. After a total length of , the Mat flows into the Adriatic Sea near Fush√´-Kuqe, between the towns of Lezh√´ and La√ß.

Lopatka was tortured and strangled to death on October 16, 1996, by Robert \\"Bobby\\" Frederick Glass, a computer analyst from North Carolina. The apparent purpose was mutual sexual gratification. The case was reportedly the first where a police department arrested a murder suspect with evidence primarily gathered from email messages. Background Sharon Lopatka was the first of four daughters born to Orthodox Jewish parents Mr. and Mrs. Abraham J. Denburg.Bell, p. 2. They were members of the Beth Tfiloh Congregation, Abraham being a cantor at the synagogue. Raised in Baltimore, Maryland, Sharon was seen by her classmates \\"as normal as you can get\\", wrote The News & Observer, and was a part of sport teams and her school's choir club. Graduating from Pikesville High School in 1979,\\"Take My Life\\". The News & Observer. Retrieved October 29, 2016. Lopatka married construction worker Victor in Ellicott City, Maryland, in 1991, and moved with him to a ranch- esque tract house in Hampstead, Maryland, in the early 1990s. The marriage was described by a classmate of Lopatka as a \\"way of breaking away\\", and her parents did not support it. In 1995 Lopatka started doing online advertising businesses from her Ellicott City home in order to make additional money.Lybarger, Jeremy (July 3, 2016). \\"A death on Usenet: Sharon Lopatka and the strange case of \\"consensual murder\\"\\". The Kernel. Retrieved August 18, 2016. The first website she hosted, \\"House of Dion\\", was for selling home decor guides by mail for seven dollars. An advertisement on the website read, \\"Home decorating secrets seen in the posh homes from the New England states to the Hollywood homes can now be yours. Never published before! Quick easy ways to decorate your home.\\" She was paid $50 per advertisement rewriting ad copy her business titled \\"Classified Concepts\\". She ran several websites for distributing psychic readings, also garnering a percentage of the money from sales of other services with premium-rate telephone numbers advertised on her websites. In addition to her advertising and psychic reading business, Lopatka marketed pornographic content, under the alias Nancy Carlson, which depicted women who were unconscious from being drugged, hypnotized or chloroformed engaging in sex acts with each other. She sold her undergarments, an advertisement for them reading, \\"Is there anyone out there interested in buying my worn panties...\\" She also used the Internet to fulfill her own sexual desires that were often considered irregular to society. Lopatka went under more pseudonyms and personas when on pornographic chat rooms of sites like fetishfeet.com and sexbondage.com that had members with fetishes such as necrophilia, bondage and sadomasochism.Bell, p. 3. More than 50 messages that showed her sexual desire of being tortured to death were discovered by The News & Observer. Lopatka's character of Carlson, who was a disciplinarian dominatrix pornographic film actress who weighed 300 pounds, was one of the pseudonyms she used in the chats. This alarmed a sex workers' rights activist named Tanith who tried to stop Lopatka's behavior. Lopatka replied to Tanith that \\"I want the real thing. I did not ask for you preaching to me.\\" Robert \\"Bobby\\" Frederick Glass worked as a computer analyst for the government of Catawba County, North Carolina, for nearly 16 years. His tasks included programming tax rolls and keeping track of the amount of vehicle gas consumption in the county.Bell, p. 4. For 14 years until May 1996, Glass was married to his wife Sherri, and the couple had two daughters and one son. Later in the marriage, Sherri noticed her husband was spending much more time on the computer than with her. Wary, she logged on to his email account and found several \\"raw, violent and disturbing\\" messages that he sent under the pseudonyms Toyman and Slowhand. As a result, the two separated. Lopatka first met Glass in August 1996 while in a pornographic chat room.Bell, p. 5. Through email, Lopatka presented her fetish of being tortured to Glass, while he sent messages about how he would fulfill her fantasy. Close to 900 pages of emails between the two were discovered by police during the investigation of Lopatka's death. Death and investigation On the morning of October 13, 1996, Lopatka informed her husband she was going to Georgia to meet acquaintances. She also left him a note that she would not be returning home and requested not to track down Glass. The note also read that \\"If my body is never retrieved, don't worry: know that I'm at peace.\\" That morning, Lopatka drove her blue Honda Civic to Baltimore's Pennsylvania Station (a 45-minute drive) and had arrived on an Amtrak train at Charlotte, North Carolina, by 8:45 p.m. Glass drove with Lopatka in his pickup truck to his rural Lenoir, North Carolina mobile home, 80 miles from Charlotte. Lopatka's husband Victor found the note his wife left for him and notified the police, who found six weeks of email conversations between Lopatka and Glass. In her email correspondence with Glass, Lopatka had explicitly asked Glass to torture her to death. Glass, interviewed later during his imprisonment, admitted to fulfilling Lopatka's torture fantasy, but also said that the death was an accident. As he recalled, \\"I don't know how much I pulled the rope ... I never wanted to kill her, but she ended up dead.\\" This was supported by the autopsy performed by Dr. John Butts, the chief state medical examiner of North Carolina, who stated that Lopatka was accidentally strangled to death three days after her arrival in North Carolina. However, the police disagreed: their search warrant affidavits described the death as intentional, and that the emails proved it. North Carolina police staked out Glass' home for several days, but did not see Lopatka. On October 25, 1996, Judge Beverly T. Beal issued a search warrant on the home, and inside the house, investigators discovered items belonging to Lopatka. In addition, they also found drug and bondage equipment, child pornography magazines, a .357 Magnum pistol, and several computer disks, as well as trash and toys outside the trailer. A police officer then noticed a mound of soil 75 feet away from the home, before finding some bodyparts buried two and a half feet below. Glass was arrested at work following this discovery, charged with first-degree murder, and held without bond in the Caldwell County Jail. Glass was also hit with additional state and federal charges for the possession of child pornography. County investigator D. A. Brown said that Lopatka's body might have never been found had it been buried in the woods behind Glass' house. Glass pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and sexual exploitation charges on January 27, 2000, and was sentenced to 36‚Äì53 months in the Avery-Mitchell Correctional Institution. He was also sentenced to an additional 27 months for federal charges of second-degree minor exploitation, to be served consecutively. Glass was found dead of a heart attack in prison on February 20, 2002, one month before he was to finish his state sentence and begin his federal sentence. Influence The Lopatka case was reportedly the first where a murder suspect was put in custody by the police department mainly due to evidence from emails. A majority of the media coverage of Lopatka's killing mainly put their focus on the dangerous consequences of Internet-held meetings. Several people requested that a form of censorship should be created to better protect humans from killings like that of Lopatka's, while anti-censorship activists counter- argued that people could better express controversial beliefs in an open forum without the need of a real identity. Writers have labeled the situation as one of the earliest examples of what psychologists called Mardi Gras phenomenon, where one uses a variety of personalities to decrease their chances of having a consequence for their actions. Thanks to the popularity of the case, more psychologists increased their desire to have a better understanding of atypical sexual desires caused by sadism, masochism and asphyxia.Bell, p. 6. Cultural references The case inspired a 2008 film, Downloading Nancy, which premiered at Sundance Film Festival and had a wider release in 2009. Interviews with screenwriter Lee Ross indicate he was aware of the Lopatka case and found it \\"dark, horrible ... and intriguing\\".

In France, academies are institutions and learned societies which monitor, foster, critique and protect French cultural production. Academies were more institutional and more concerned with criticism and analysis than those literary gatherings today called salons which were more focused on pleasurable discourse in society, although certain gatherings around such figures as Marguerite de Valois were close to the academic spirit. History Academies first began to appear in France in the Renaissance. In 1570 Jean-Antoine de Ba√Øf created one devoted to music and poetry, the Acad√©mie de Po√©sie et de Musique, inspired by Italian models (such as the academy around Marsilio Ficino). The first half of the seventeenth century saw a phenomenal growth in private learned academies, organized around a half-dozen or a dozen individuals meeting regularly.Viala, 1985. Viala's first chapter is entirely devoted to these academies. By his count, 70 were created during the 17th century. By the middle of the century, the number of private academies decreased as academies gradually came under government control, sponsorship and patronage. The first private academy to become \\"official\\" and to this day the most prestigious of governmental academies is the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise (\\"French Academy\\"), founded in 1634 by Cardinal Richelieu. It is concerned with the French language. In the fine arts, the Acad√©mie de Peinture et de Sculpture (\\"Academy of Painting and Sculpture\\") was founded by Cardinal Mazarin in 1648 and was soon followed by a number of other officially instituted academies: the Acad√©mie Royale de Danse (\\"Royal Academy of Dance\\") in 1661; the Acad√©mie Royale des Inscriptions et M√©dailles (\\"Royal Academy of Inscriptions and Medals\\") in 1663 [renamed the Acad√©mie Royale des Inscriptions et Belles-lettres (\\"Royal Academy of Inscriptions and Literature\\" or \\"Royal Academy of Humanities\\") in 1716]; the Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences (\\"Royal Academy of Sciences\\") in 1666; the Acad√©mie d'Op√©ra (\\"Academy of Opera\\") in 1669 [renamed the Acad√©mie Royale de Musique (\\"Royal Academy of Music\\") in 1672 and the Acad√©mie de Musique in 1791]; and the Acad√©mie Royale d'Architecture (\\"Royal Academy of Architecture\\") founded by Jean-Baptiste Colbert in 1671.Howard Mayer Brown and Iain Fenlon, \\"Academy\\" in Sadie 2001. In 1793 during the French Revolution the academies were suppressed, but in 1795 the Institut national des sciences et des arts (now the Institut de France) was established and consisted of three Classes: Sciences Physiques et Math√©matiques (\\"Physical and Mathematical Sciences\\"); Sciences Morales et Politiques (\\"Moral and Political Sciences\\"); and Litt√©rature et Beaux-Arts (\\"Literature and Fine Arts\\"). In 1803 under Napoleon the name was changed to Institut National de France, and it was reorganized into four Classes: 1. Sciences Physiques et Math√©matiques; 2. La Langue et Litt√©rature Fran√ßaises (\\"French Literature and Language\\"); 3. Histoire et Litt√©rature Anciennes (\\"History and Ancient Literature\\"); and 4. Beaux-Arts (\\"Fine Arts\\"). The Institut was renamed the Institut de France in 1806 and Institut Imp√©rial de France in 1811.Lane 1989 and South Kensington Museum 1891, p. 453. The Institut was renamed again in 1814 under the Bourbon Restoration to Institut Royal de France, and in 1816, the older appellation of \\"Acad√©mie\\" was revived, when it was reorganized into four sections: the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise; the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres; the Acad√©mie des Sciences; and the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. The last consisted of three subordinate academies, those of painting and sculpture, music, and architecture. In 1833 the earlier class, Sciences Morales et Politiques, which had been suppressed in 1803 under Napoleon, was revived as a fifth academy, the Acad√©mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques. French Academy in Rome The Acad√©mie de peinture et sculpture is responsible for the Acad√©mie de France in the Villa M√©dicis in Rome (founded in 1666) which allows promising artists to study in Rome. Salons as exhibitions From the 17th to the 20th century, the Acad√©mie de peinture et sculpture organized official art exhibitions called salons. To show at a salon, a young artist needed to be received by the Acad√©mie by first submitting an artwork to the jury; only Acad√©mie artists could be shown in the salons. Salons were started under Louis XIV and continued from 1667-1704. After a hiatus, the salons started up again in 1725. Under Louis XV, the most prestigious Salon took place in Paris (the Salon de Paris) in the Salon Carr√© of the Louvre, but there were also salons in the cities of Bordeaux, Lille and Toulouse. In 1881, the government withdrew official sponsorship from the annual Salon, and a group of artists organized the Soci√©t√© des artistes fran√ßais to take responsibility for the show. In the 19th century, the salon system frequently incited criticism from artists for the bland or academic quality of the artwork, while radical artists (like √âdouard Manet or Gustave Courbet) would not be received or would be greatly censored by the \\"respectable\\" public. The salon system thus forced radical and modern artists to seek alternative or unofficial exhibition sites. This is especially true for Impressionists and Fauvism.

It was for this fair that the Eiffel Tower was built (1887‚Äì1889). *The Grand Palais and the Petit Palais were built as exhibition halls for the Exposition Universelle (1900). Paris was also the site of two world exhibitions of decorative arts: *The Exposition internationale des arts d√©coratifs et industriels modernes in 1925 launched the style called \\"Moderne\\", or \\"Streamline Moderne\\" or \\"Art Deco\\". *The subsequent exhibition, the \\"Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)\\", in 1937 saw, to a certain degree, the last flowering of this style; the Palais de Tokyo was built for this exhibition.

During his nine-year playing career with the New York Yankees, Kubek played in six World Series in the late 1950s and early 1960s, starting in 37 World Series games. For NBC television, he later broadcast twelve World Series between 1968 and 1982, and fourteen League Championship Series between 1969 and 1989. Kubek received the Ford C. Frick Award in 2009. Playing career A left-handed batter, Kubek signed his first professional contract with the Yankees and rose rapidly through the team's farm system. He was 21 years old when he played his first game in Major League Baseball in 1957, and‚Äîexcept for one year (1962) spent largely in the U.S. military‚Äîremained with the Yankees until his retirement due to a back injury at the close of the 1965 season. In his prime he formed a top double play combination with second baseman (and roommate) Bobby Richardson on an infield that also featured third baseman Clete Boyer. In 1957, teammate Sal Maglie praised Kubek when talking to Robert Creamer of Sports Illustrated. \\"He's a nice boy, that Kubek. He's going to be a great player. He's a fine hitter right now. He hits with the pitch and it's hard to fool him. His wrists are so quick he can wait to see where the pitch is thrown before he commits himself, and then he can push it to left or pull it to right. And he's never satisfied with himself. That's the sign of a good ballplayer.\\" Kubek in 1961 Kubek played 1,092 games, 882 of them at shortstop (although he also was an outfielder and utility infielder in his early career), compiling a lifetime batting average of .266 with 57 home runs. The 38 doubles he totaled in 1961 remained the Yankee club record for shortstops until 2004, and his career fielding percentage and range factor were both above league average. During his nine years with the Yankees, he played on seven American League pennant winners (1957‚Äì58, 1960‚Äì64) and three world champions (1958, 1961‚Äì1962). In a 1976 Esquire magazine article, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \\"All Time All-Star Argument Starter\\", consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Kubek was the shortstop on Stein's Polish team. In 1982, Kubek was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame. In 1986, Kubek was on hand for the only Old-Timers' Day at Yankee Stadium that he would take part in. That year, the event was a reunion of the 1961 Yankees and marked the recent passing of Roger Maris. He was signed by Yankees scout Lou Maguolo. =Rookie of the Year= In 1957, Kubek won the American League Rookie of the Year Award. In Game 3 of the 1957 World Series, he had one of the best World Series games a rookie has ever had, going 3 for 5 with two home runs, three runs scored, and four RBI. Kubek is one of five rookies to hit two home runs in a World Series game. Another Yankee, Charlie Keller, had performed the feat in the 1939 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Cardinal Willie McGee homered twice in the 1982 World Series against the Milwaukee Brewers. All three of these feats occurred in a Game 3; Kubek's and McGee's both occurred at Milwaukee County Stadium. The Atlanta Braves' Andruw Jones homered twice in Game 1 of the 1996 World Series at Yankee Stadium. Michael Conforto of the New York Mets became the fifth member of this club when he hit two in Game 4 of the 2015 World Series on October 31, 2015. =1960 World Series= In Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, Kubek was injured by a bad-hop ground ball that struck him in the throat; Kubek was badly hurt and the batter, Bill Virdon, reached first base, enabling the Pittsburgh Pirates to rally in a game they eventually won 10‚Äì9 on a ninth-inning home run by Bill Mazeroski. Kubek was sensitive about the Bill Virdon incident. When future broadcasting partner Bob Costas once referenced Virdon's smash on the air, Kubek put his hand on Costas' thigh to stop him. Just before the 1963 World Series, TV personality Phil Silvers, a Dodger fan, provided a reporter with a list of Yankee players to rattle. He included Kubek: \\"Show him a pebble.\\" Broadcasting careerNBC Sports, CTV and TSN= Upon his retirement, Kubek became a color analyst on NBC's Saturday Game of the Week telecasts, teaming with play-by-play announcer Jim Simpson on the network's backup games from 1966‚Äì68 and then joining Curt Gowdy to form the lead crew in 1969. He spent 24 years at NBC, teaming with such announcers as Simpson, Gowdy (whom Kubek later called his favorite partner), Joe Garagiola, and Bob Costas. Kubek could be considered baseball's first network baseball analyst as contrasted with a color commentator, similar to Tim McCarver and Jim Kaat later. In addition to the weekly in-season games, Kubek worked over a dozen World Series (1969‚Äì1976, 1978, 1980 and 1982) for NBC, as well as numerous American League Championship Series (1969‚Äì1975, 1977, 1979, 1981, 1983, 1985, 1987 and 1989) and All-Star Games (1969‚Äì1975, 1977, 1979 and 1981). He also worked local telecasts for the Toronto Blue Jays on The Sports Network and CTV from their inaugural season of 1977 through 1989. The Toronto Star stated Kubek \\"educated a whole generation of Canadian baseball fans without being condescending or simplistic.\\" During the winter, Kubek would go hunting, coach junior high basketball, and wait for baseball to resume. Personality As both a local and national sportscaster, Kubek was known for his outspokenness. While calling the 1972 American League Championship Series, Kubek said that Oakland's Bert Campaneris throwing his bat at Detroit's Lerrin LaGrow (who had just knocked Campaneris down with a low, inside pitch) was justified, on the grounds that any pitch aimed squarely at a batter's legs could endanger his career. Angered by Kubek's comments, executives from Detroit's Chrysler Corporation, which sponsored NBC's telecasts, phoned then-Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn, who, in turn, called the network about the matter. On April 8, 1974, when Hank Aaron hit his record-breaking 715th career home run, Kubek, who was calling the game with Curt Gowdy and Joe Garagiola, criticized Bowie Kuhn on air for failing to be in attendance at Atlanta on that historic night. Kuhn later argued he had a prior engagement he could not break. In the 10th inning of Game 3 of the 1975 World Series, Cincinnati's C√©sar Ger√≥nimo reached first base. Then, Boston catcher Carlton Fisk threw Ed Armbrister's bunt into center field. Kubek, on the NBC telecast, immediately charged that Armbrister interfered (with the attempted forceout), though home plate umpire Larry Barnett did not agree. After Joe Morgan drove in the game-winning run for the Reds in a 6‚Äì5 victory, Barnett blamed Kubek and Gowdy for inciting death threats against him. Later, Kubek got 1,000 letters dubbing him a Boston stooge. In 1978, Kubek had said of New York Yankees' owner George Steinbrenner that \\"He's got an expensive toy. Baseball's tough enough without an owner harassing you.\\" In a Sports Illustrated article published May 27, 1991, on the Yankees' bad season, he would go on to criticize Steinbrenner once again by saying, \\"George's legacy is not the World Series winners of '77 and '78 or having the best record of any team in the '80s, his legacy is these past five seasons‚Äîteams with worse and worse records culminating in last year's last- place finish.\\" Kubek also added, \\"George talked a lot about tradition, but it was all phony, it was just him trying to be part of the tradition. You can't manufacture tradition in a plastic way. You have to have a certain class to go with it.\\" With Bob Costas The team of Kubek and Bob Costas (backing up Vin Scully and Joe Garagiola and later, Tom Seaver) proved to be a formidable pair. Costas was praised by fans for both his reverence and irreverence while Kubek was praised for his technical approach and historical perspective. One of the pair's most memorable broadcasts was the \\"(Ryne) Sandberg Game\\" (between the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals at Chicago's Wrigley Field) on June 23, 1984. In the ninth inning, the Cubs, trailing 9‚Äì8, faced the premier relief pitcher of the time, Bruce Sutter. Sandberg, then not known for his power, slugged a home run to left field against the Cardinals' ace closer. Despite this dramatic act, the Cardinals scored two runs in the top of the tenth. Sandberg came up again in the tenth inning, facing a determined Sutter with one man on base. Sandberg then shocked the national audience by hitting a second home run, even farther into the left field bleachers, to tie the game again. The Cubs went on to win in the 11th inning.The Top 20 Cub HR Of All Time‚ÄîNo. 4 Ryne Sandberg 6/23/1984‚ÄîBleed Cubbie Blue . When Sandberg hit that second home run, Costas said, \\"Do you believe it?!\\" The Cardinals' Willie McGee also hit for the cycle in the same game. Kubek and Costas, who had worked together since 1983 (calling four American League Championship Series: 1983, 1985, 1987, and 1989), called the final edition (the 981st overall) of NBC's Game of the Week which aired on September 30, 1989. That game featured the Toronto Blue Jays (Kubek was broadcaster, from 1977 to 1989 for the Blue Jays) beating the Baltimore Orioles 4‚Äì3 to clinch the AL East title at SkyDome. When the subject came up of NBC losing the rights to televising Major League Baseball for the first time since 1946, Kubek said, \\"I can't believe it!\\" The final broadcast for Kubek and Costas as a team was Game 5 of the 1989 American League Championship Series (October 8), also at SkyDome, where the Oakland Athletics won to advance to the World Series. =MSG Network and retirement= When NBC lost its baseball TV rights to CBS after the 1989 season, Kubek left the national scene, joining the Yankees' local cable-TV announcing team (which earned Kubek US$525,000 a year). Kubek spent five years calling games for the Yankees (1990‚Äì1994) on the MSG Network with Dewayne Staats, where he earned fans and critics' respect for his honesty. After 1994, Kubek effectively quit broadcasting. He explained his sudden retirement from sportscasting by saying: Kubek added, \\"I want to go home and spend more time with my family. They deserve it more than anyone. I don't need that ego stuff. I feel sorry for those who do.\\" Kubek's resignation coincided with the bitter strike that wound up cancelling the World Series in 1994. In a 2008 New York Times article, Kubek claimed not to have seen a major league game since his retirement from broadcasting. Kubek lives in Appleton, Wisconsin, and is a supporter of the Fox Valley Lutheran High School and its baseball team. The National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame on June 20, 2019 named its inaugural Excellence in Media Award the Tony Kubek Award and Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN was honored. =Ford C. Frick Award= On December 22, 2008, Tony Kubek was named the recipient of the 2009 Ford C. Frick Award, an honor bestowed on broadcasters by the Baseball Hall of Fame. Kubek was selected for the honor by a committee of 15 prior Frick Award winners and five broadcast historians and columnists. He became the first Frick Award winner whose broadcast career was solely in television, and the first to have called games for a Canadian team, the Toronto Blue Jays, from 1977-89. In that regard he was named to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame, in St. Marys, Ontario, in the Class of 2016. Politics Kubek is a Democrat. In 1976, he declined to go to South Carolina to campaign for former teammate Bobby Richardson, a Republican, who lost a close race for the U.S. House of Representatives to incumbent Democrat Kenneth Holland by a 51% to 48% margin.

He was influential in Kataeb Party heading it for some period. He was also influential in the Lebanese Forces in various critical phases of the LF. He was also minister of state in a Rafic Hariri government in 2004. Early life and education Pakradouni was born in the Armenian district of Beirut, Bourj Hammoud, on 18 August 1944 to an Armenian Orthodox father Minas Pakradounian and Maronite Catholic mother, Lour Shallita from Qartaba. His father, Minas Pakradounian, left the Ottoman Empire in 1920 and settled in Aleppo, Ottoman Syria. Several years later, he moved to Lebanon where he married Shallita. Pakradouni has no familial ties to the traditional political elite in Lebanon. Pakradouni received his secondary education at Coll√®ge Notre Dame de Jamhour in the suburbs east of Beirut in the Baabda district. He became politically active as a teenager, joining the Christian nationalist Kataeb Party (Phalange party) in 1959. He continued his education at the Lebanese French Saint Joseph University (Universit√© de St. Joseph / USJ), studying law, history and political science, and graduated in 1968. Political career Pakradouni has been a leading figure in the Kataeb Party since 1968 when he was elected president of the party's student organization. Salem Abdelnour who was his spouse's uncle provided him with the financial security to forgo a career and concentrate on his political aspirations. True to his Arabist tendencies, he developed close ties with the PLO and famously led a Kataeb student delegation to Jordan to meet with Yasser Arafat in 1969. He was elected to the Kataeb party's political bureau in 1970 and remained in the party's top echelon, leading the so-called \\"Arabist\\" faction of the Kataeb Party (Phalange), which favored close ties with Syria. During the reign of Lebanese President Elias Sarkis in the 1970s, he was assigned as political advisor to the president. Pakradouni was also a leading figure in the Lebanese Forces. After Bachir Gemayel tried to unite Christian military forces under the title of the Lebanese Forces, Pakradouni joined in. He was also part of the consultative team of Gemayel entrusted with the presidency's pan-Arab relations when Gemayel was elected President of the Republic. Gemayel was assassinated prior to his inauguration as president. Pakradouni remained an influential figure during the Lebanese Forces head Elie Hobeika's reign after many revolted against the earlier chief of the LF Fouad Abou Nader and excluded Abou Nader from power. However, in a later internal feud in the Lebanese Forces led by Samir Geagea to remove Hobeika from power, Pakradouni squarely sided with Geagea against Hobeika who escaped to Syrian-controlled area. In 1994, after the pro-Syrian Lebanese government ordered the dissolution of the LF and arrest of Samir Geagea on 21 April 1994, Pakradouni was sidelined and later on returned to the Kataeb Party. On 4 October 2001, he was elected president of the Kataeb party, in a bid to unite the party divided between various factions prior to his ascendancy to the top position in the party. However throughout his tenure during the Syrian occupation of Lebanon, pro-Syrian party members were promoted and anti-Syrian members were intimidated or ejected. In 2004, he was appointed minister of state for administrative development to the cabinet led by Rafic Hariri. Until December 2007, he was the hands-on leader of the Kataeb party, while former Lebanese president Amin Gemayel was the \\"higher leader.\\" Pakradouni resigned from office in 2007 and in February 2008, Gemayel became the sole leader. Personal life In 1968, Pakradouni married Mona al Nashif, the niece of former member of the Lebanese Parliament, businesswoman and philanthropist Salem Abdelnour.

By the late 17th century the construction and maintenance of the huge number of ships required to build and defend the British Empire left few trees in Britain suitable for use as large spars. Eastern white pines from colonial New England were superior timber for the single-stick masts and booms of the day. To maintain Britain's naval and trading advantage, laws were passed in North America to protect selected white pines for British shipbuilding. British success in the War of Jenkins' Ear (1739-1748) and the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) were due in large part to the control of the seas by the Royal Navy. Mast pines In order to preserve suitable timber for the Royal Navy, the New Hampshire General Court passed a law in 1722 making it illegal to cut down \\"any white pine tree of the growth of 12 inches of diameter\\" or face a fine of ¬£5 to ¬£50, depending upon the diameter of the tree and whatever lumber was unlawfully cut down. \\"Surveyors of the King's Woods\\" were assigned by the Crown to identify all suitable \\"mast pines\\" with the broad arrow wherever they were found. The law caused more anguish and anger than the Stamp Act or tea tax. The result of the law caused a patriotic backlash of sentiment, making it unfashionable to have floorboards less than wide. The law was not strictly enforced until John Wentworth was appointed governor of the New Hampshire colony in 1766. Although often sympathetic to the colonists, he held firm on this issue. Pine Tree Riot John Sherman, Deputy Surveyor of New Hampshire, ordered a search of sawmills in 1771-1772 for white pine marked for the Crown. His men found that six mills in Goffstown and Weare possessed large white pines and marked them with the broad arrow to indicate that they were Crown property. The owners of the mills were named as offenders in the February 7, 1772, edition of The New Hampshire Gazette. The mill owners hired lawyer Samuel Blodgett to represent them, who met with Governor Wentworth. When the governor offered Blodgett the job of Surveyor of the King's Woods, he accepted, and rather than getting the charges dropped instructed his clients to pay a settlement. The mill owners from Goffstown paid their fines at once and had their logs returned to them. Those from Weare refused to pay. On April 13, 1772, Benjamin Whiting, Sheriff of Hillsborough County, and his Deputy John Quigley were sent to South Weare with a warrant to arrest the leader of the Weare mill owners, Ebenezer Mudgett. Mudgett was subsequently released with the understanding that he would provide bail in the morning. The sheriff and deputy spent the night at Aaron Quimby's inn, the Pine Tree Tavern. That night, many of the townsmen gathered at Mudgett's house. A few offered to help pay his bail, but the majority wanted to run the sheriff and deputy out of town. They finally decided to teach Whiting a lesson that he would never forget. At dawn the next day Mudgett led between 20 and 30-40 men to the tavern. Whiting was still in bed, and Mudgett burst in on him. With their faces blackened with soot for disguise, more than 20 townsmen rushed into Whiting's room. They began to beat him with tree branch switches, giving one lash for every tree being contested. The sheriff tried to grab his pistols, but he was thoroughly outnumbered. Rioters grabbed him by his arms and legs, hoisted him up, face to the floor, while others continued to mercilessly assault him with tree switches. Whiting later reported that he thought the men would surely kill him. Quigley was also pulled from his room and received the same treatment from another group of townsmen. The sheriff and deputy's horses were brought around to the inn door. The rioters then cut off the ears and shaved the manes and tails of the horses, after which Whiting and Quigley were forced to ride out of town through a gauntlet of jeering townspeople, shouted at and slapped down the road towards Goffstown. Whiting engaged Colonel Moore of Bedford and Edward Goldstone Lutwyche of Merrimack, who assembled a posse of soldiers to arrest the perpetrators. By the time the posse arrived, the townspeople had fled into the woods without a trace a long while ago. After searching, one of the men involved in the assault was arrested, and the others were named, ordered to post bail and appear in court. Eight men were charged with rioting, disturbing the peace, and \\"making an assault upon the body of Benjamin Whiting.\\" Four judges, Theodore Atkinson, Meshech Weare, Leverett Hubbard, and William Parker, heard the case in the Superior Court in Amherst in September 1772. The rioters pleaded guilty, and the judges fined them 20 shillings each and ordered them to pay the cost of the court hearing. Following events The Pine Tree Riot was a test of the British royal authority. This is partially evident by the light fines exacted against the rioters. Some believe this to be an inspiring act for the Boston Tea Party. The first Pine Tree Flag flown by colonists against the British was red with a pine tree within a white square in the upper left corner. Of the men charged, Timothy Worthley, Jonathan Worthley and William Dustin fought against the British in the Revolutionary War, as did even Samuel Blodgett. Benjamin Whiting fought for the British and had his land confiscated as a Tory sympathizer. Meshech Weare, one of the judges, assisted in framing the New Hampshire constitution adopted in 1776, establishing its own government, and becoming the first colony to declare its independence; Weare became the first President of New Hampshire. Samuel Blodget went on to construct the first canal around the Amoskeag Falls on the Merrimack River in Derryfield, completed shortly before his death in 1807. In 1810, the town of Derryfield changed its name to Manchester in honor of Blodget's vision that the Amoskeag Falls would someday power a manufacturing center to rival Manchester, England. Blodget Street in Manchester is named in his honor.http://www.newhampshire.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130627/NEWHAMPSHIRE01/130629286/-1/SERVICES Participants *John Sherburn - Deputy Surveyor *Samuel Blodgett - lawyer and later Surveyor *Benjamin Whiting - County Sheriff *John Quigley - Deputy Sheriff *Aaron Quimby - owner of the Pine Tree Tavern *Ebenezer Mudgett - leader of sawmill owners in Weare, rioter *Colonel Moore - head of a regiment that marched to Weare *Colonel Edward Goldstone Lutwyche - head of a regiment that marched to Weare *Timothy Worthley - resident of Weare, rioter *Jonathan Worthley - resident of Weare, rioter *Caleb Atwood - resident of Weare, rioter *William Dustin - resident of Weare, rioter *Abraham Johnson - resident of Weare, rioter *Jotham Tuttle - resident of Weare, rioter *William Quimby - resident of Weare, rioter and brother of Aaron Quimby *Honorable Theodore Atkinson - Chief Justice *Honorable Meshech Weare - Justice *Honorable Leverett Hubbard - Justice *Honorable William Parker - Justice ReferencesExternal links * Weare Historical Society - \\"The Pine Tree Riot\\" * New Hampshire History Curriculum Sample Lesson Plans - \\"We Had a Riot\\" * \\"The Pine Tree Riot\\", Historical article about the Riot. * An account of the survey of logs by Deputy Surveyor John Sherburn in the History of Goffstown Further reading *Evans, Connie. \\"Ebenezer Mudgett and the Pine Tree Riot\\" (Amazon, 2017) * Joseph J.

He was an Official War Artist for Australia. Life and work Rick Amor was born in Frankston, Victoria, Australia. He has a certificate in art from the Caulfield Institute of Technology, and Associate Diploma in Painting from the National Gallery School, Melbourne.[1] He began exhibiting at the Joseph Brown gallery in 1974 and has shown annually at Niagara Galleries since 1983. Amor has entered the Archibald Prize at over 10 times and been exhibited nine times. He has been the recipient of several Australia Council studio residencies, allowing him to work in London, New York and Barcelona. In 1999 he was one of the first Australian artists to be appointed as the Official War Artist to East Timor by the Australian War Memorial, and the first since the end of the Vietnam War. Over the course of his artistic career, Amor has held over 70 solo exhibitions and over 100 group shows. In 2013 a 30th Anniversary exhibition of his extended practice was held at Niagara Galleries. In 1990 McClelland Gallery curated a major survey exhibition of his paintings, which went on to tour various regional galleries in Victoria and South Australia throughout 1990 and 1991. An exhibition of his prints toured various regional galleries in Victoria and Tasmania between 1993 and 1994.[2] In 1993 another exhibition staged by Bendigo Art Gallery toured Australia. Amor's most recent exhibitions include Rick Amor: Contemporary Romantic at Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide in 2017, Rick Amor: 21 Portraits at the National Portrait Gallery, Canberra in 2014, Rick Amor: From Study to Painting in 2013 at Castlemaine Art Gallery and Historical Museum, Victoria, and an exhibition at the Australian Print Workshop in 2012. Recent significant group shows have included the 2017 Blue Chip XIX: The Collectors‚Äô Exhibition, at Niagara Galleries, the Melbourne Art Fair, Melbourne, and the Small Sculpture Fair at McClelland Sculpture Park and Gallery in 2013. In the 2005, Peter Berner interviewed Amor for a documentary about the Archibald Prize entitled Loaded Brush. Major texts on Amor's work have also been published in the last twenty years. These include Barry Pearce's 100 Moments in Australian Painting, which was published in 2014 by NewSouth Publishing, Gary Catalano‚Äôs biography, The Solitary Watcher: Rick Amor and his Art, published by The Miegunyah Press in 2001, and Gavin Fry‚Äôs richly illustrated monograph, Rick Amor, published by The Beagle Press in 2008.  Paintings  Rick Amor's work borrows heavily from the pictorial traditions of Symbolism and Surrealism. The legacy of these art movements manifests within the poetic quality of Amor's style. Amor's handling of light and his alluring manipulation of depth of field in his paintings achieves a sustained sense of tension and mystery that insinuates a multiplicity of meanings. His works include psychologically potent symbolism and his landscapes in particular convey a disquieting atmosphere, with objects saturated by contrasting light and shadows. His major recurring subjects are the solitary watcher, figures at twilight, the vast emptiness of urban spaces and quiet mysterious interiors. Even throughout his journalistic works, such his war paintings of East Timor his works are capitvating for their unfathomable subtexts. Sebastian Smee wrote in a review of Amor's 2008 retrospective exhibition at Heide Museum of Modern Art, that he was:  Sculpture  Since the early 1990s, Rick Amor has also incorporated sculpture into art practice. Amor typically works in the medium of bronze for his sculptural works. He begins the process of creating each mould at home, which he then has cast in foundry using the Lost-wax casting method. Amor's sculptures are object and figure based, and are often incredibly textural to achieve an impression rather than a replication of the subject.

The character is usually depicted as a superhero and psychiatrist in the Marvel Universe, known as a supporting character in stories featuring the Hulk. He was portrayed by Ty Burrell in the 2008 Marvel Cinematic Universe film The Incredible Hulk. Publication history Doc Samson debuted in the Incredible Hulk #141 (July 1971), created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Herb Trimpe.Doc Samson at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on April 4, 2016. Since then he has also appeared as a supporting character in several different Marvel Comics titles, including She-Hulk, Uncanny X-Men, and Amazing Spider- Man. In 1996 Doc Samson starred in his first self-titled miniseries written by Dan Slott. In 2006, Samson starred in his second miniseries written by Paul Di Filippo and penciled by Fabrizio Fiorentino. Fictional character biography First appearance of Doc Samson from issue #141 of The Incredible Hulk. Art by Herb Trimpe Leonard Skivorski, Jr. was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was raised Jewish and attended yeshiva.Incredible Hulk #373. Marvel Comics. His father, Dr. Leonard \\"Leo\\" Skivorski, was a popular psychiatrist in his hometown who specialized in treating young women, often conducting extramarital affairs with them.Hulk Vol 2 #18. Marvel Comics. Mrs. Skivorski had nicknamed her husband \\"Samson\\" after his long hair. Leonard Jr. initially expressed disinterest in becoming a psychiatrist, perhaps because he resented his father's philandering. Despite this, he became a college professor and psychiatrist. After Bruce Banner was temporarily cured of being the Hulk by siphoning off the gamma radiation that caused his transformations, Samson, who had been working with Banner/Hulk in his job as a psychiatrist, exposed himself to some of the siphoned radiation, granting him a superhumanly strong and muscular physique and causing his hair to turn green and to grow long, reminiscent of his biblical namesake. Initially, Samson's physical strength depends upon the length of his hair, though his gamma mutation eventually stabilized, making the length of his hair no longer a factor. Shortly afterward, his flirting with Betty Ross causes a jealous Banner to re-expose himself to radiation, becoming the Hulk once more to battle Samson.Incredible Hulk #141. Marvel Comics. Samson learns that his power decreases when he cuts his green hair,Incredible Hulk #143. Marvel Comics. but he loses his powers due to a bombardment of intense gamma radiation.Incredible Hulk #147.

During the training part, the Champion disqualifies him since he declared him unfit to be a worthy opponent.Marvel Two-in-One Annual #7. Marvel Comics. The Vision offers Doc Samson a position as the leader of a midwestern branch of the Avengers. Samson says that he is flattered, but has already accepted a position teaching at Northwestern University, which he prefers to the life of a hero, and additionally that administration is not his strong point.Avengers vol. 1 #252. Marvel Comics. Samson, determined again to cure the Hulk, defeats him in battle by triggering the Banner personality to make illusions of various supervillains for the Hulk to fight. Eventually convinced Samson is an illusion, the Hulk leaves himself open for a sucker punch by Samson, rendering the Hulk unconscious.Incredible Hulk #314. Marvel Comics. Samson succeeds in separating Bruce Banner and the Hulk physically into two separate individuals. He rescues the Hulk from S.H.I.E.L.D.'s attempt to execute him, although the now separated Hulk, to Samson's surprise turns out to be even more angry and bestial than before. After feeling guilty for the ensuing carnage and death, Samson pledges to kill the Hulk.Incredible Hulk #315. Marvel Comics.

To \\"cure\\" the Hulk's multiple personality disorder, Samson hypnotizes Banner with the Ringmaster's help and successfully begins the process of integrating the Banner, grey Hulk and green Hulk personalities into a new Hulk.Incredible Hulk #377. Marvel Comics. The results extend beyond his control, however, leading to a somewhat unstable merger which eventually fragments once more into a fourth personality, albeit a more benign one than the previous Hulks. Around this time, Samson attends the execution of convicted murderess \\"Crazy Eight\\".Incredible Hulk #380. Marvel Comics. Doc Samson was also a part of Bruce Jones' run on The Incredible Hulk, with one of the main characters Jones introduced supposed to be Samson's ex-wife. Samson sports an eyepatch during much of this run. After discovering that a covert organization which is hunting the Hulk has implanted a surveillance device in Samson's eye, he removes the device with a scalpel and wears the eyepatch for protection while his eye heals. In addition to the Hulk, his most prominent patient, Samson has also spent time in a professional capacity with the second X-Factor,X-Factor #78. Marvel Comics. the Molecule Man, She-Hulk, and the Punisher, among others. He is befriended by Doctor Strange's new pupil Jack Holyoak,In the 2006 Doc Samson miniseries and helps his friends' daughter Tina Punnett rescue her \\"New-Age hippie\\" parents from dealing with the ghost of musician Cam Larson guarded by Living Totem. Searching for his friend Sam Laroquette, Doc Samson along with Living Totem, Tina, and Jack arrives at new age cultist Doctor Arick Schnellageister's farm where they all fight the Stephen King- inspired, nightmarish Weed. The third issue was written by Jay Faerber and it shows Samson helps the new Scorpion come clean after being implied to have killed S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. The final two-parter was a storyline involving Nightmare from a different dimension sending the alternate Doc Samson to help him invade the regular 616 Marvel Universe. Those last two issues had Frank Espinosa's short Living Totem stories as back up. Samson reappears, helping Jennifer Walters,She-Hulk #8 (2005). Marvel Comics. and treats Rachel Grey.Uncanny X-Men #469. Marvel Comics. He talks with Valerie Cooper, regarding her and the O*N*E organization taping his session with Rachel, even though he asked her not to. Samson was a member of Iron Man's Pro-Registration side in the \\"Civil War\\" storyline.The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 1 #533. Marvel Comics. He gave each member of the newest incarnation of X-Factor a session after a particularly troubling mission. He is paying particular attention to the team's leader, Jamie Madrox.X-Factor vol. 3 #13. Marvel Comics. Samson is shown working alongside the Pro-Registration alliance. As part of this group, he helps She-Hulk and Spider-Man take down a rampaging robot threatening innocent civilians. Samson remains on Iron Man's side during the final breakout at the Negative Zone prison. The Pro-Registration people ultimately win when Captain America surrenders. Samson plays a role in the events of the \\"World War Hulk\\" crossover event of 2007. Dr. Samson was instrumental in the Illuminati plan of exiling the Hulk as well as de-powering She-Hulk for Iron Man. Samson was sent by Mr. Fantastic to retrieve She-Hulk after she discovered that her cousin was exiled, and tries to convince her that her cousin deserved his punishment after recalling several moments when the Hulk fought the members of the Illuminati. She-Hulk punches Samson into another state after realizing that Samson was siding with the Illuminati. Samson is shown to be one of the various heroes that helped during the evacuation of New York.World War Hulk #1. Marvel Comics. Later he and the Avengers are quickly defeated by the Hulk and his Warbound allies, whereby Doc Samson and his fallen teammates are 'enslaved' by obedience discs (the very same technology used to control the Hulk/Green Scar and other Gladiators on Sakaar).World War Hulk #2. Marvel Comics. Following a climactic and hard-fought victory over the Sentry, Doc Samson is freed from his obedience disk after Tony Stark activates a series of satellite devices that open fire on the Hulk and leave him unconscious, and in his human/Bruce Banner form.World War Hulk #5. Marvel Comics. Samson is appointed by the Initiative to serve as therapist for Penance.Thunderbolts #117 He successfully helps Penance regain his original Speedball powers and make steps towards psychological recovery.Thunderbolts #121. Marvel Comics. He is sent by the CSA to temporarily suspend Tony Stark from his S.H.I.E.L.D. duties pending psychological evaluationIron Man vol. 4 #23. Marvel Comics. and while overseeing this was drawn into assisting Tony in uncovering the Mandarin's Extremis conspiracy. He gives evidence to the UN Security Council in Tony's cover, sparring verbally with Norman Osborn in the process.Iron Man vol. 4 #27. Marvel Comics. Following the \\"Secret Invasion,\\" Doc Samson is shown leading a support group meeting with those that had been replaced by Skrulls.Avengers: The Initiative #20. Marvel Comics. Later, he appears on Air Force One, attempting to disclose the full activities of Norman Osborn within Thunderbolts Mountain to the new United States President. Before Samson is able to play the evidence, Osborn's new Thunderbolts hijack the plane: the Ghost takes the evidence, Ant-Man implants a gamma-emitter on the back of Samson's neck causing him to grow angry and more powerful in a Hulk- like manner, and someone wearing the Green Goblin's costume attacks the airplane.Thunderbolts #128. Marvel Comics.Thunderbolts #129. Marvel Comics. Samson's increased anger brings him to attack the President, but he is phased out of the plane by the Ghost. Osborn reasons that, in his enhanced state, Doc Samson probably survived the fall, and places a global warrant for his arrest, suggesting that Samson attempted to kill the President. In the debut issue of the 2008 Hulk title, written by Jeph Loeb, Samson appears in Russia, alongside Iron Man, General Ross, and She-Hulk (whose attitude towards Samson is still antagonistic). The group is investigating the murder of the Abomination at the hands of a Hulk-like creature. After an altercation over jurisdiction with the Russian Winter Guard (a fight which Samson uncharacteristically starts), Samson and Ross return to the United States to consult with Banner, who is imprisoned in a high-security facility.Hulk vol. 2, #1 (March 2008). Marvel Comics. However, the Helicarrier crashes near New Jersey. Tony Stark orders Maria Hill to investigate, and search for survivors. Clay Quartermain's corpse is found mangled and ravaged, and the area bathed with gamma radiation. General Ross' and Samson's bodies are missing. Leonard's coat is found ripped and shredded in a Hulk-like fashion, exhibiting higher gamma radiation values than every other item in the wreckage.Hulk vol. 2, #4 (Aug. 2008). Marvel Comics. Samson later shoots Rick Jones and drags him away after Jones attempts to reveal the Red Hulk's true identity.Hulk vol. 2, #6 (Nov. 2008). Marvel Comics. In Incredible Hulk #600 (Sept. 2009), it's revealed the reason Samson shot Rick Jones is because Samson now has multiple personality disorder. Samson grows larger in size (hence the high gamma output and ripped jacket in the Red Hulk story arc), his hair grows out, and in this form he is stronger and faster than Jennifer Walters. He also has a lightning bolt scar across his chest. Samson claims, just before his evil persona takes over, that he was brainwashed by MODOK who would not let him talk. This personality refers to himself only as \\"Samson\\" and claims Leonard is never coming back. However, after MODOK subdues She-Hulk and Samson to keep them from destroying the facility, and just before it does explode due to a fight between Rulk and Hulk, Rulk is standing over Leonard (now short haired again) and She-Hulk claiming the three of them will ride out the explosion.The Incredible Hulk #600 (Sept. 2009). Marvel Comics. A subsequent appearance features \\"Samson\\" apparently attending a psychological evaluation which discusses his feelings of inadequacy compared to other heroes, never attracting the attention of either the public or women despite his powers, only for the appointment to be revealed to be a confrontation in Samson's mind between his three personas: Samson, Doc Samson, and Dr. Leonard Samson PhD. Concluding that his intellect is what has been holding him back in his previous confrontations, Samson \\"kills\\" his other two personas, prompting MODOK - who has been watching Samson in a cell while the \\"dream\\" takes place - to conclude that he is ready.Hulk vol. 2, #18 (Feb. 2010). Marvel Comics. After Banner frees the other captive intellectuals in the Intelligencia's trap, they quickly determine that the Red Hulk 'creation process,' if accidentally or intentionally done incorrectly, will result in a series of \\"Hulked Out\\" individuals who will briefly obtain the same abilities as Red Hulk and Red She-Hulk, although these 'overcharged' candidates will overload and die not long afterward. Many of these candidates include members of the X-Men, Avengers, and the Fantastic Four who were inadvertently caught in a shipwide blast of cathexis rays. After re-tooling the Cathexis Ray Generator to re-absorb and turn the Hulked-Out Heroes (and A.I.Marines) back to normal, Banner tries to absorb all of the energy with his body - and mostly succeeds - but at a crucial juncture, the machinery begins to break down from the feedback. Samson steps in and absorbs the additional excess energy, but for unknown reasons, his body is unable to absorb the energy as readily as Banner's body can and he is killed by the overload, reduced to a charred skeleton in seconds.Incredible Hulk #610 (Aug. 2010). Marvel Comics. During the \\"Chaos War\\" storyline, Doc Samson returns from the dead after what happened to the death realms. He helps Bruce and the other Hulks fight Brian Banner, Abomination, and the demons on Amatsu-Mikaboshi's side. Doc Samson was helpful in holding off Abomination. When Hercules sacrificed the All-Father powers to heal the universe, some of those who came back to life returned to the afterlife while the others remained among the living.Incredible Hulk #619 (Feb. 2011). Marvel Comics. When Red Hulk and Doctor Strange traveled to the Monster Metropolis and enlisted the help of the Legion of Monsters, they discover that the spirit that has been haunting Red Hulk is the insane evil side of Doc Samson (referred to as Dark Samson) which has not passed into the next life. Using a ghost entrapment device, Red Hulk and the Legion of Monsters were able to destroy the Dark Samson spirit by ripping him in half. Red Hulk and the Legion of Monsters did a toast to honor Doc Samson after that.Hulk Vol. 2 #52 (July 2012). Marvel Comics. During the \\"Civil War II\\" storyline, Doc Samson somehow turned up alive at the Triskelion to visit Captain Marvel. She then learns that Doc Samson is there to evaluate her.Civil War II #0. Marvel Comics. When Banner has returned from the dead, Doc Samson worked to track him down. After getting Hulk calmed enough to talk with him, Doc Samson learned that Hulk called this form Devil Hulk as Doc Samson notes that this version is much different from the last Devil Hulk he encountered. Then Hulk showed Doc Samson that there is a hole where Rick Jones was buried after he was killed by Hydra during their rise to power.Immortal Hulk #15. Marvel Comics. Doc Samson and Hulk learned that Rick Jones' body was taken by the U.S. Hulk Operations. When they arrived at the U.S. Hulk Operations's base in New Mexico, they fought against the gamma-irradiated creatures until Doc Samson is shot in the head by Bushwacker.Immortal Hulk #16. Marvel Comics. After Hulk destroyed the base and killed Bushwacker, Doc Samson recovered from his head wound and was picked up by the Alpha Flight Space Program's version of Gamma Flight and taken to their base for treatment and debriefing. Doc Samson revealed to Gamma Flight about Devil Hulk's plan to wipe out humanity and how he will carry it out.Immortal Hulk #18. Marvel Comics. Doc Samson aided Gamma Flight in looking for Hulk. When they arrived where Hulk was fighting Subject B, they found the Subject B body that Rick Jones was in and took it to the Alpha Flight Low-Orbit Space Station for study.Immortal Hulk #20. Marvel Comics. Wearing the Redeemer armor, General Reginald Fortean raided the Alpha Flight Low-Orbit Space Station to reclaim the Subject B husk. Doc Samson and Walter Langkowski were shot while the other Gamma Flight members were incapacitated.Immortal Hulk #21. Marvel Comics. Doc Samson recovered from the shot and joined Gamma Flight in attacking the U.S. Hulk Operations at their base in Groom Lake at Area 51. While the U.S. Hulk Operations anticipated their arrival, Doc Samson was shocked when General Fortean had merged with the Subject B husk. The confrontation was interrupted when Hulk, Rick Jones, Harpy, and Jackie McGee raided the base.Immortal Hulk #22. Marvel Comics. A fight broke out between the U.S. Hulk Operations, Gamma Flight, and Hulk's group. When soldiers used concentrated U.V. lights on Hulk, Doc Samson jumped in front of Hulk and took the blast.Immortal Hulk #23. Marvel Comics. Upon his death, Doc Samson's soul was transported to Below- Place and ran into Hulk and General Fortean's Subject B form when they killed each other. He even has an encounter with the One Below All. After Samson and Hulk resurrected themselves after General Fortean was killed by Hulk's Grey Hulk persona, Hulk took over the Shadow Base as Samson stays by Hulk's side to keep an eye on him.Immortal Hulk #24. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Doc Samson possesses superhuman physical abilities as a result of exposure to high levels of gamma radiation. The gamma radiation mutated Samson's physique by adding considerable muscle and bone mass to his body, granting him high levels of superhuman strength. Initially, his strength was dependent on the length of his hair and the longer it was, the more powerful he became, although his mutation has since stabilized, making his hair length irrelevant. Samson's strength is equal to that of the Gray Hulk, a.k.a. Joe Fixit, while the latter is in a calm emotional state. Unlike the Hulk, however, Samson's strength does not increase due to adrenaline surges while angry. As a result, Samson is less powerful than an angered Hulk. Samson is able to leap great distances vertically and horizontally, though not nearly as far as the Hulk or the Abomination. Aside from granting him more muscle mass, Samson's bodily tissues are fortified and are considerably harder than those of an ordinary human, granting him a high level of resistance to physical injury. Samson can withstand falls from great heights, extremes of temperature, high-caliber bullets, and tremendous impact forces like being repeatedly struck by the Hulk without sustaining injury. Due to his highly advanced musculature, his muscles produce considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of a normal human, granting him superhuman stamina. He has demonstrated sufficient stamina to battle a mindless incarnation of the Hulk for more than six hours. The discovery of a new persona within Leonard's psyche, which he calls \\"Samson\\", (later referred to as \\"Dark Samson\\") reveals that Doc Samson is capable of much higher powers than previously observed. Like others who have gamma-induced powers, Doc Samson is immune to terrestrial diseases. Unlike the Hulk, Abomination, or even She-Hulk, Samson has not demonstrated any accelerated healing powers. Samson is said to be one of the most renowned psychiatrists on Earth.Incredible Hulk vol. 2 #227. Marvel Comics. He is often called on to counsel various superhumans, such as the members of X-Factor. He has a M.D. in psychiatry, and is a skilled theoretical technician and inventor of various medical devices. His extensive study of the mind also permits him a significant degree of resistance to telepathy and telepathic attacks. Samson is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant, which, coupled with his physical attributes, has allowed him to engage the Hulk for extended periods of time, and he briefly held his own against the combined forces of Iron Man, Wonder Man, Sub-Mariner, and Hercules, after they had first fought the mindless Hulk. He sometimes uses psychology as a tool to get through a more powerful opponent's guard, such as an Infinity Gem-empowered Titania.She-Hulk vol. 3 #12. Marvel Comics. Personality Unlike the Hulk, Doc Samson originally did not suffer from dissociative identity disorder, and retained his genius intellect. However, in recent years, he has developed a split personality: his calm conscious personality \\"Leonard\\" and his rude personality \\"Samson\\". He has conducted research on gamma beings like himself and has come to the conclusion that gamma mutation is largely determined by the subject's deepest sense of self. Hence, his form is based on a subconscious desire for superhuman power like the Biblical Samson.Incredible Hulk vol. 2, #393. Marvel Comics. While attacking the Thunderbolts, the telepath Mirage noted that Doc Samson, who was present in Thunderbolts Mountain, had some fascinating thoughts. In his mind she saw that, while his mental reactions to Norman Osborn and Moonstone were Hulk-like, he was still able to control himself from physically acting on those impulses. Other versionsEarth X= In Earth X, it is stated that Doc Samson was killed when the Skull used his powers of persuasion to force Samson to rip himself inside out.

Marvel Comics. =Mutant X= In the Mutant X Earth, Doc Samson had gained green skin and an expanded physique, much like the Hulk. He still manages to keep his calm and rational mind.

Music career  Melvoin met Prince in 1983, one night when she was practicing guitar in Lisa Coleman's room. A few days later, when guitarist Dez Dickerson didn't show up at soundcheck, Prince asked her to play his guitar; that same night, Prince invited her to join the band. Melvoin's debut show with The Revolution was a benefit concert for the Minnesota Dance Theatre at the First Avenue nightclub in Minneapolis on August 3, 1983. This concert was recorded and some of the tracks ended up on Purple Rain, Prince's next record, most notably the title track. Melvoin was 19 at that time. Shortly after the completion of Prince and The Revolution's 1986 album Parade, Coleman and Melvoin left the Revolution and started their own duo, Wendy & Lisa, also known as Girl Brothers. Melvoin and Coleman also composed music for the first season of the TV series Heroes.Melvoin's and Coleman's compositions for Heroes closely followed their music-scoring of the previous Tim Kring series, Crossing Jordan, which had starred Jill Hennessy in the lead role. In September 2008, they announced that they would release an album consisting entirely of the score from Heroes, entitled Heroes: Original Score. Melvoin and Coleman composed the main title song for Nurse Jackie, for which they were awarded with an Emmy in 2010. As of mid-November 2015, the duo were working on the American TV series Touch. Melvoin also contributed guitars to Madonna's 2008 album Hard Candy on the song \\"She's Not Me\\", and she is mentioned by name during the song. She contributed heavily to Neil Finn's second solo album One Nil, co-writing many tracks and playing drums and bass on several. She is credited for guitar work on most of the tracks on Rob Thomas's first solo album, ...Something to Be. Melvoin is also listed in the credits of Glen Campbell's 2011 final studio album, Ghost on the Canvas. Personal life Wendy Melvoin was born in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of jazz pianist and former president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, Mike Melvoin, who in the 1960s was part of the Los Angeles session musician collective The Wrecking Crew. Her brother, Jonathan Melvoin, was the Smashing Pumpkins touring keyboardist, and her twin sister is singer and composer Susannah Melvoin. In April 2009, Melvoin gave an interview with Out magazine that, for the first time, publicly revealed that she is a lesbian and discussed her past romantic relationship with Lisa Coleman, who is still her musical partner. She was in a longterm relationship with film director Lisa Cholodenko. They have one child together. Awards and recognition In 2007, the ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards gave Melvoin and Coleman the \\"Top Television Series\\" award for their work on Heroes. Melvoin and Coleman were awarded with an Emmy for Outstanding Original Main Title in 2010 for their theme to Nurse Jackie. They also technically share the honor of winners of a Grammy and Oscar for being part of The Revolution, as Purple Rain won two Grammys, and the Oscar for Best Original Score. In 2014, Melvoin and Coleman received the inaugural Shirley Walker Award from The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), an award which honors those whose achievements have contributed to the diversity of film and television music.

Such a family was previously recognized by most taxonomists. The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, 1998), also recognizes this family, and assigns it to the order Poales in the clade commelinids, in the monocots. The family consists of only one genus Sparganium of fewer than two dozen species, perennial plants of wet habitats. By the APG III system of 2009, Sparganium had been found to be fairly closely related to Typha, and so was placed with that genus in family Typhaceae. The Cronquist system, of 1981, also recognized such a family and placed it in the order Typhales in the subclass Commelinidae in class Liliopsida in division Magnoliophyta. The Wettstein system, last updated in 1935, placed the family in order Pandanales. External links *Sparganiaceae in L. Watson and M.J. Dallwitz (1992 onwards).

They are found at altitudes of up to in the Andean rainforests. The genus is named after Spanish pharmacist and naturalist, Anastasio Guzman. Several species of this genus are cultivated as indoor and outdoor garden plants. The best known is Guzmania lingulata (scarlet star) which bears orange and red bracts. The plant dies after it has produced its flowers in summer, but new plants can easily be propagated from the offsets which appear as the parent plant dies. They are epiphytes and can do well if tied on to pieces of bark with roots bound into sphagnum moss. Guzmanias require warm temperatures and relatively high humidity. The sac fungus Bipolaris sorokiniana (anamorph of Cochliobolus sativus) and others can cause fatal root rot in plants of this genus if the roots get too wet and cold.

comedy-drama film directed and produced by Frank Capra, and starring Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck. The film is about a \\"grassroots\\" political campaign created unwittingly by a newspaper columnist with the involvement of a hired homeless man and pursued by the paper's wealthy owner.Dirks, Tim. \\"Filmsite Movie Review: Meet John Doe (1941).\\" Filmsite.org (AMC Networks). Retrieved: March 13, 2015. It became a box-office hit and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Story. It was ranked #49 in AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Cheers. In 1969, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.Pierce, David. \\"Forgotten faces: Why some of our cinema heritage is part of the public domain.\\" Film History, Vol. 19, No. 2, 2007, pp. 125‚Äì143. It was the first of two features Capra made for Warner Brothers, after he left Columbia Pictures. His second film for Warners was Arsenic and Old Lace (1944). Plot Infuriated at being told to write one final column after being laid off from her newspaper job, Ann Mitchell prints a letter from a fictional unemployed \\"John Doe\\" threatening suicide on Christmas Eve in protest of society's ills. When the letter causes a sensation among readers, and the paper's competition suspects a fraud and starts to investigate, editor Henry Connell is persuaded to rehire Ann, who schemes to boost the newspaper's sales by exploiting the fictional John Doe. From a number of derelicts who show up at the paper claiming to have written the original letter, Ann and Henry hire John Willoughby, a former baseball player and tramp in need of money to repair his injured arm, to play the role of John Doe. Ann starts to pen a series of articles in Doe's name, elaborating on the original letter's ideas of society's disregard for people in need. Willoughby gets $50, a new suit of clothes, and a plush hotel suite with his tramp friend \\"The Colonel\\", who launches into an extended diatribe against \\"the heelots\\", many heels who incessantly focus on getting money from others. Proposing to take Doe national via the radio, Ann is given $100 a week by the newspaper's publisher, D. B. Norton, to write radio speeches for Willoughby. Meanwhile, John is offered a $5,000 bribe from a rival newspaper to admit the whole thing was a publicity stunt, but ultimately turns it down and delivers the speech Ann has written for him instead. Afterward, feeling conflicted, he runs away, riding the rails with the Colonel until they reach Millsville. \\"John Doe\\" is recognized at a diner and brought to City Hall, where he's met by Bert Hanson, who explains how he was inspired by Doe's words to start a \\"John Doe club\\" with his neighbors. The John Doe philosophy spreads across the country, developing into a broad grassroots movement whose simple slogan is, \\"Be a better neighbor\\". However, Norton secretly plans to channel support for Doe into support for his own national political ambitions. When a John Doe rally is scheduled, with John Doe clubs from throughout the country in attendance, Norton instructs Mitchell to write a speech for Willoughby in which he announces the foundation of a new political party and endorses Norton as its presidential candidate. On the night of the rally, John, who has come to believe in the John Doe philosophy himself, learns of Norton's treachery from a drunken Henry. He denounces Norton and tries to expose the plot at the rally, but Norton speaks first, exposing Doe as a fake and claiming to have been deceived, like everyone else, by the staff of the newspaper. Despondent at letting his now- angry followers down, John plans to commit suicide by jumping from the roof of the City Hall on Christmas Eve, as indicated in the original John Doe letter. Ann, who has fallen in love with John, desperately tries to talk him out of jumping (saying that another John Doe, has already died for the sake of humanity), and Hanson and his neighbors tell him of their plan to restart their John Doe club. Convinced not to kill himself, John leaves, carrying a fainted Ann in his arms, and Henry turns to Norton and says, \\"There you are, Norton! The people!

The screenplay was derived from a 1939 film treatment, titled \\"The Life and Death of John Doe\\", written by Richard Connell and Robert Presnell who would go on to be the recipients of the film's sole Academy Award nomination for Best Original Story. The treatment was based upon Connell's 1922 Century Magazine story titled \\"A Reputation\\". Gary Cooper was always Frank Capra's first choice to play John Doe. Cooper had agreed to the part without reading a script for two reasons: he had enjoyed working with Capra on their earlier collaboration, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), and he wanted to work with Barbara Stanwyck. The role of the hardbitten news reporter, however, was initially offered to Ann Sheridan, but the first choice for the role had been turned down by Warner Bros. due to a contract dispute, and Olivia de Havilland was similarly contacted, albeit unsuccessfully. The composer selected was frequent Capra collaborator Dimitri Tiomkin, who also did the scores for Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and It's a Wonderful Life. He later won two music Oscars for the non-Capra film High Noon. Reception Bosley Crowther, the film critic for The New York Times wrote that John Willoughby was just the latest of the everyman that Frank Capra had portrayed in earlier films: In the Variety review, there was a more critical look at the plot: The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2003: AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Heroes & Villains: ** John Willoughby ‚Äì Nominated Hero * 2006: AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Cheers ‚Äì #49 Adaptations Meet John Doe was dramatized as a radio play on the September 28, 1941 broadcast of The Screen Guild Theater, starring Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward Arnold in their original roles.

After the 2016 season Coach Smith resigned, citing the need to spend more time with his family. As his replacement, Nathan Castorena took over the Lions and served for two seasons.http://www.thisweeknews.com/sports/20170317/football- castorena-eager-to-lead-lions In March 2019, Bexley announced the hiring of long-time Central Ohio coach Mike Golden.https://bexleyathletics.com/2019/03/13/bexley-seizes-golden- opportunity/ =Volleyball program= After setting a school record for wins in the 2007 season, going 25‚Äì2, and ending the season as Regional runners-up, Bexley has had few successful seasons since. Reasons for this include lack of a consistent coaching staff, and a competitive league. Bexley has continued to improve over the past few years and expects to do well in the near future. =Soccer program= Both the Men's and Women's soccer programs are outstanding, and are widely known around the state and region. Between the men and the women they have combined for 12 State Final Fours since 1999.

The Men's program won their league championship for 15 straight seasons, until the streak was ended in 2008. The team was formerly coached by former Bexley player and OWU graduate Greg Kullman and is currently coached by Brian Stoddard. The women have been one of the most consistent teams, regardless of sport (in the state) since coach Scott Dempsey took over. They were state finalists in 1999 through 2003, 2005, 2006, state runners-up in 1999, and State Champions in 2009 (although they were defeated in the championship game, the opposing team was playing with an ineligible player, forcing them to forfeit the championship). The women have also had multiple All District, All State, and All American recipients. The team is currently coached by Scott James. =Wrestling program= The wrestling program has had individual successes throughout the school's history. There have been numerous state qualifiers, 10 state placers and one state champion.

In 1926 he was admitted to the South Australian Society of Arts, their youngest member. Apart from his art studies (three nights a week and on Saturdays), he had a normal boy's interest in sport, and satisfactory academic results. In 1927, encouraged by his tutor Marie Tuck (1866‚Äì1947), the 15-year-old Ivor sailed to Europe, where he studied drawing and painting for six months at the academy run by Louis- Fran√ßois Biloul (1874‚Äì1947) in Paris, and another six months at the summer school run by (1870‚Äì1937) at Reichersbeuern, Bad T√∂lz-Wolfratshausen in the Bavaria Alps. He returned to Australia early in 1930.Hylton, Jane The Productive Artist 2002 Wakefield Press, Adelaide He was to return to Paris and Bavaria three years later, as a married man. At age 20 Hele married Jean Berry, a prominent women's basketball player and official. They renovated the isolated and rambling Hotel Aldinga on the Old Coach Road, abandoned after construction of the Main South Road and the population centre of Aldinga moving to the seaside. In 1936 his painting The Proclamation won first prize in a competition to mark the Centenary of South Australia. In 1938 a major work, Sturt's Reluctant Decision to Return won the Commonwealth sesquicentenary prize of 250 guineas (perhaps AUD 20,000 in today's money). The picture was purchased by the Government for the future National Gallery of Australia, but is rather to be found at the Art Gallery of South Australia. Encouraged by Thomas Blamey, who had been impressed by the Sturt painting and with a promise of support for his artistic career, Hele enlisted as a private soldier in the 2nd AIF and in June 1940 sailed for the Middle East with the 2/48th Battalion, 9th Australian Division. On 9 January 1941 Blamey met him personally; he was promoted to lieutenant with responsibilities as a war artist, given a truck and batman-driver and instructed to join the 6th Division in its push to Tobruk. Around June 1941 he joined the Military History and Information Section of the AIF, under John Treloar, which had a studio in Heliopolis, which he shared with Lyndon Dadswell and John Dowie. He was appointed an official War Artist on 11 October 1941 with the rank of Captain. He returned to Australia with the 6th and 7th Divisions and by April was back at Aldinga, and started on his ambitious series of paintings based on his extensive portfolio of sketches and paintings, many of which had in transit been accidentally ruined. Treloar, impatient with Hele's progress called on Louis McCubbin, director of the Art Gallery of South Australia, to investigate; McCubbin expressed his satisfaction and Treloar was mollified. He remained with the 9th Division, which was later transferred to New Guinea. After the war he returned to Aldinga, where from his extensive portfolio of sketches, he executed many of the paintings which are held by the Australian War Memorial. In 1952 he was appointed as a war artist to the Australian forces in Korea.McCulloch, Alan, Encyclopedia of Australian Art Hutchinson of London, 1968 Apart from the figure studies and war scenes held by the Australian War Memorial for which he is best known, and the many portraits, Ivor Hele painted many landscapes, particularly of the rugged South Australian coast, and a great number of erotic drawings. The National Gallery of Australia holds around 130 of his works, mostly minor pieces, and the Art Gallery of South Australia a few dozen. His work was occasionally seen at The Advertiser's open-air art exhibitions, and very few one-man shows: in 1943, 1945, 1954 and finally 1970 at the John Martin's auditorium during the Festival of Arts. =Personal life= Hele had an older brother, Harold A. Hele (23 April 1908 ‚Äì 19 December 1941), and twin sisters, Beryl, who married Alf Head on 4 October 1930, and Phyllis Hele, who married Jack Dew Laurenti on 3 March 1937. A niece, sculptor Marcia Rankin, inherited Hele's sketchbooks, which she presented to the Australian War Memorial. In 24 March 1932 Hele married Millicent Mary Jean Berry, a school teacher, at the Manse, Germein Street, Semaphore, South Australia. They divorced in 1957 and he married June Weatherly. Hele was severely self-critical and only ever held two exhibitions of his work, in 1931 and 1958. He was a perfectionist who often burned paintings he was dissatisfied with. Hele died in the South Australian suburb of Bedford Park and was cremated.

Cover art by Lydia Gibson. The Friends of Soviet Russia (FSR) was formally established in the United States on August 9, 1921 as an offshoot of the American Labor Alliance for Trade Relations with Soviet Russia (ALA). It was launched as a \\"mass organization\\" dedicated to raising funds for the relief of the extreme famine that swept Soviet Russia in 1921, both in terms of food and clothing for immediate amelioration of the crisis and agricultural tools and equipment for the reconstruction of Soviet agriculture. From 1927 the organization was known as the Friends of the Soviet Union (FSU) and was the American national affiliate of a new international authority known as the International Association of Friends of the Soviet Union. Organizational HistoryEarly work= The Friends of Soviet Russia proved successful in raising funds for Russian relief, generating about $750,000 and clothing worth an additional $300,000 during the first 14 months of its existence. The funds were raised transparently, with the name of each donor and the amount given published in each issue of Soviet Russia; detailed lists of expenditures, regularly audited, were also published. In round numbers, about 25% of the group's income went to administration and the costs of fundraising with the balance to relief. The FSR was the American division of Workers International Relief, an international organization headed by the German Communist Willy M√ºnzenberg. Membership in the FSR was open without regard to an individual's politics, but the organizational apparatus was tightly controlled by dedicated adherents of the Communist movement. In the documents of the underground Communist Party of the day, the ALA was referred to as \\"the A\\" and the FSR (or \\"Fessar\\") as \\"the B.\\" The FSR published a program in December 1922 which listed the group's aims: (1) to advocate the extension of credits to and recognition of the Soviet government; (2) to raise and distribute funds for clothing and food for the needy of Soviet Russia, to be distributed via the Soviet government \\"regardless of their political opinions\\"; (3) to agitate and demonstrate for non-intervention in the affairs of the Russian people in determining their form of government; (4) to raise funds for tools for the reconstruction of Soviet industry; and (5) to disseminate \\"truthful news\\" about Soviet Russia and build sympathetic sentiment.Friends of Soviet Russia, \\"Program of the Friends of Soviet Russia,\\" Soviet Russia, Dec. 1922. . =Structure and relations with other organizations= The FSR was structured around over 200 organized branches around the country, which raised funds to support the relief effort and the organization directing it. It maintained an office in New York and a paid staff of about 40 \\"organizers\\", members of the Workers Party of America (WPA), some of whom were engaged to travel the country speaking on behalf of the organization and engaging in politics \\"in their free time.\\" In this sense, the FSR subsidized WPA activity by providing paid employment for some of its leading cadres. This structure drew the ire of the opponents of the WPA, particularly Abraham Cahan, editor of the Socialist Party-affiliated Yiddish daily The Jewish Daily Forward, which began making charges of irregularity and extravagance in the handling of funds on the part of FSR in editorials and news stories in the summer of 1922. In response to these charges, the FSR appointed an \\"Investigating Committee of Five\\", including Roger N. Baldwin of the ACLU, Norman Thomas of the League for Industrial Democracy, Robert Morss Lovett of the liberal magazine The New Republic, Timothy Healy of the Stationary Fireman's Union, and attorney Walter Nelles. While the last-mention later recused himself to avoid possible charges of conflict of interest, the other four members of the committee issued a report at the end of October 1922 essentially clearing the FSR of wrongdoing and attributing the charges against the group to \\"factional interests.\\" =Publications= The organ of the FSR was the magazine Soviet Russia, a plain-paper magazine which had originated as the journal of the Russian Soviet Government Bureau (RSGB), headed by Ludwig Martens in New York in 1919. The Martens Bureau had first sent out 13 issues of a weekly news sheet called The Weekly Bulletin of the Bureau of Information of The Soviet Union, intended as a sort of news service for the used of other periodicals but had decided to issue its own magazine starting June 7, 1919.Russian Soviet Government Bureau, \\"Preface\\" to the bound edition of Soviet Russia, Volume 1. New York: Russian Soviet Government Bureau, March 3, 1920. Unpaginated [page 3]. The RSGB stated that its new official magazine \\"is published in order to acquaint the people of the United States with the real conditions in russia and to combat the campaign of deliberate misrepresentation which is being waged by enemies of the Russian workers...\\"\\"To the Reader,\\" Soviet Russia, vol. 1, no. 1 (June 7, 1919), pg. 1. As the government of Soviet Russia was not recognized by the government of the United States, Martens was forced to shut down his bureau and leave the country in 1920. To some extent, Friends of Soviet Russia seems to have emerged as a publishing unit to keep this magazine alive. The group had a more important function, however, that being the raising of funds for relief of the devastating famine in Soviet Russia in 1921. The group briefly issued and additional typeset newsletter in conjunction with this effort, Russian Famine Relief Bulletin, although Soviet Russia rapidly absorbed this auxiliary publication's function. From its earliest days Soviet Russia magazine was essentially a Communist publication, regularly printing articles by Soviet leaders such as Zinoviev, Trotsky, and Radek about matters of Soviet internal policy and foreign relations. The magazine covered the Russian Civil War and post-war diplomatic relations, economic reconstruction in Russia, and domestic political affairs, such as the show trial of the leaders of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party in 1922. This magazine was a bi-weekly for most of the time it was under FSR auspices, switching over to a monthly publication schedule under editor Eugene Lyons in December 1922. Effective with the January 1923 issue, the magazine moved to glossy paper with a new name ‚Äî Soviet Russia Pictorial. In late 1923 and 1924, in response to the economic chaos in Germany, in particular among the German working class following the failure of the October 1923 revolution, the FSR changed its name (briefly) to \\"the Friends of Soviet Russia and Workers' Germany\\" in an effort to increase its fundraising appeal. This interlude proved brief, and the group was not long in reverting to its original name. Near the end of 1924 the magazine was merged with the CP's arts-and-theory magazine, The Liberator, and the Trade Union Educational League's monthly organ, The Labor Herald, to form The Workers Monthly in a 3-for-1 combination. This merger was probably driven by the financial concerns of the WPA and clearly underlines the connection of the FSR to the organized American Communist movement. =Friends of the Soviet Union= In November 1927 the Communist International established the International Association of Friends of the Soviet Union as a new central authority for the various national Soviet Friendship Societies which had been established around the world.Louis Nemzer, \\"The Soviet Friendship Societies,\\" Public Opinion Quarterly vol. 13, no. 2 (Summer 1949), pg. 266. In tandem with the move to this new central authority, names of the friendship societies (including the American) were standardized under the name Friends of the Soviet Union (FSU). The FSU continued forward as the publisher of a pictorial monthly magazine Soviet Russia Today.

The Formosan termite is often nicknamed the super-termite because of its destructive habits due to the large size of its colonies and its ability to consume wood at a rapid rate. A single colony may contain several million individuals (compared with several hundred thousand termites for other subterranean termite species) that forage up to 300 feet (100 m) in soil. A mature Formosan colony can consume as much as 13 ounces of wood a day (about 400 g) and can severely damage a structure in as little as three months. Because of its population size and foraging range, the presence of a colony poses serious threats to nearby structures. Once established, Formosan termites have never been eradicated from an area. Formosan termites infest a wide variety of structures (including boats and high-rise condominiums) and can damage trees. In the United States, along with another species, Coptotermes gestroi, introduced from Southeast Asia, they are responsible for tremendous damage to property resulting in large treatment and repair costs. Biology Coptotermes formosanus is a generalist, colonial, social insect building colonies either above or below ground.(Howarth 1985) Termites have a caste system, including a king, queen, workers, soldiers, and alates (winged termites). The workers provide the food, soldiers defend the nest, and reproductives breed the colony. The queen of the colony has a lifespan around 15 years and is capable of producing up to 2,000 eggs per day. The workers and soldiers may live 3‚Äì5 years with caste proportions around 360 workers per 40 soldiers.(Grace et al. 1996a). A colony is surrounded by an extensive foraging system consisting of tunnels underneath the ground, with a mature colony containing millions of termites.(Tulane 2002, ARS 2002). Older and less vigorous colonies contained workers that had a larger body mass than workers in younger colonies.Grace et al. (1995) =Nutrition= The diet of the subterranean termite consists of anything that contains wood fiber (homes, building, live trees), crops, and plants. Live trees include oak, ash, and water-bound cypress.(ARS 2002). Crops include sugarcane.(Broughton and Grace 1994). Like many other termites, the Formosan termite feeds on wood and other materials that contain cellulose, such as paper and cardboard.Cabrera et al. (2001) Bacteria and other single-celled organisms live in the termite digestive system and digest cellulose, providing nutrition and energy for these termites. However, they are known to chew through foam insulation boards, thin lead and copper sheeting, plaster, asphalt, and some plastics. Colonies of C. formosanus feeding on pecan, Carya illinoensis and red gum, Liquidambar styraciflua produced significantly more progeny than colonies feeding on other wood species tested.Morales-Ramos and Rojas (2003) Progeny of colonies feeding on pecan and American ash Fraxinus americana had significantly greater survival than progeny of colonies feeding on other wood species. Colonies feeding on nutritionally supplemented, cellulose-based matrix showed similar fitness characteristics as colonies feeding on the best wood treatments. These results indicate that differences observed in colony fitness can be partially explained by nutritional value of the food treatment, raising the possibility that wood from different tree species has different nutritional values to the Formosan subterranean termites. This suggests that feeding preference of C. formosanus is at least partially influenced by the nutritional value of the food source. =Reproduction and lifecycle stages= Fertile queen A single colony of C. formosanus may produce over 70,000 alates. After a brief flight, alates shed their wings. Females immediately search for nesting sites, with males following closely behind. When the pair finds a moist crevice with wooden materials, they form the royal chamber and lay about 15 to 30 eggs. Within two to four weeks, young termites hatch from the eggs. The reproductives nurse the first group of young termites until the young termites reach third instar. One to two months later, the queen lays the second batch of eggs. These eggs will eventually be nursed by termites from the first batch of eggs. A colony may reach substantial numbers to cause severe damage and produce alates within three to five years.Su and Scheffrahn (2000) As an introduced speciesHistory= The Formosan termite acquired its name because it was first described in Taiwan in the early 20th century, but C. formosanus is probably endemic to southern China. This destructive species was apparently transported to Japan prior to the 17th century and to Hawaii in the late 19th century.(Su and Tamashiro 1987). By the 1950s, it was reported in South Africa. During the 1960s, it was found in Texas, Louisiana, and South Carolina. In 1980, a well-established colony was thriving in a condominium in Hallandale Beach, Florida. Formosan termites are rarely found north of 35¬∞N. They have been reported from 11 states, including Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. Their distribution will probably continue to be restricted to southern areas of the United States because the eggs will not hatch below about 20 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞F). =Economic impact= Coptotermes formosanus is the most economically serious pest in Hawaii, costing residents $100 million a year.(Tulane 2002) Historic structures in Hawaii have been threatened, such as Iolani Palace in Honolulu.(Grace et al. 2002) It has its greatest impact in North America. It is currently one of the most destructive pests in the United States,Lax and Osbrink (2003) estimated to cost consumers over $1 billion annually for preventive and remedial treatment and to repair damage caused by this insect. In New Orleans, 30-50% of the city's 4,000 historic live oak trees are believed to be infested, with total damage costing the city $300 million a year.(Tulane 2002) In North America, C. formosanus creates significantly bigger colonies, and therefore more damage, than native US termites, which reside underground and enter buildings only to forage.Raloff (2003) C. formosanus is the most destructive, difficult to control, and economically important species of termite in the southern United States.Fei and Henderson (2003) Impacts of increased use of pesticides to control the termite population has led to higher costs for homeowners and destructive effects on the environment, including contamination of water supplies caused by runoff.(Yates et al. 2000).

It was founded by John and Ida Jacobs and was located on Ocean and Second Ave., the current location of The Stone Pony. John and Ida started by selling hot dogs to tourists in 1922 at the Second Avenue location, but with the help of their daughter Jeanette and son-in-law Murray Wiener, eventually purchased the seasonal snack bar along with the property and established a family restaurant naming it Mrs. Jay's. John and Ida also opened Mrs. Jay's Beer Garden located on Ocean Avenue to the left of the restaurant serving 2% beer until the end of prohibition in 1933. Starting in 1965, Mrs. Jay's Beer Garden briefly offered Go-Go dancing as entertainment, but a dancers see through blouse resulted in a police raid and the quick demise of Go-Go at Mrs. Jay's. The Wiener's sold off the restaurant in the 1970s keeping only the beer garden, which by this time had become a popular music scene and bikers hangout. In 1974, the new owners of the restaurant building converted it into the nightclub known as The Stone Pony. Steven Adler from Guns N' Roses wore a Mrs. Jay's T-shirt during the \\"Paradise City\\" video. Many bikers drank here and a very large number of motorcycles can be seen parked in front of Mrs. Jay's Beer Garden in photos. Since Mrs. Jay's was an open-air establishment, it was open during the summer months. Mrs Jay's served mostly beer in pitchers or mugs and hotdogs and often featured live music. After a change of ownership in the early to mid-1980s, Mrs. Jay's Beer Garden fell on hard times and eventually the venue closed around the end of the decade, a victim of the disintegrating Asbury Park beach front area. During its existence until its final closing, it played host to many of the local scene's most popular bands and solo artists, capitalizing on the seaside shore town's nightlife scene. Bands such as the Tim Ryan Band, The Z Band, The Mango Brothers and The Acme Boogie Company were among the many local talents that regularly could be found on the stage there, with entertainment seven nights a week. Sometime later, the beer garden structure was razed with the empty lot being acquired by the Stone Pony for use as an outdoor concert venue.

The area was home to (and takes its name from) what was once one of the busiest rail yards on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. The \\"Potomac Yard\\" name is also used to refer to several developments in the area, especially the Potomac Yard Retail Center strip mall and a planned Washington Metro rail station. In 2018, Amazon.com, Inc. announced plans to locate part of its \\"HQ2\\" second headquarters project in Northern Virginia, specifically in the newly re- branded cross-jurisdictional neighborhood of National Landing, which local and state officials said would include Potomac Yard as well as nearby parts of southern Arlington, including the Crystal City neighborhood that will be the hub of the HQ2 development. Amazon initially planned to split HQ2 between National Landing and Long Island City, New York, but opposition from New York officials led Amazon to cancel that portion of the project, leaving National Landing as the only HQ2 site. In conjunction with Amazon's selection of National Landing, Virginia Tech stated it would establish an \\"Innovation Campus\\" in the Alexandria portion of the neighborhood.

The land, much owned by the Swann and Daingerfield families, became part of Alexandria County, D.C. with the creation of the District of Columbia in 1791, and retroceded to Virginia in 1846. Its role as a transportation hub began when Congress chartered the Alexandria Canal Company in 1830. The canal, which opened on December 2, 1843, would connect the port of Alexandria with the end of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (completed 1850) in Georgetown via the Potomac Aqueduct Bridge. It would operate until abandoned in 1886. Potomac Yard, circa 1917 Railroad development in the area began in the 1850s, though stymied by political concerns and by the American Civil War. The Alexandria and Washington Railroad began service on a new rail line between Long Bridge and Alexandria in 1857. Order to the region's mishmash of active and abandoned rail lines and stations did not come until the City Beautiful movement of the late 19th century. The 1901 Plan for Washington, D.C. (report of the McMillan Commission) proposed consolidating the region's rail operations, including a new Washington Union Station (approved 1903, completed 1908) and a New Long Railroad Bridge (completed 1904).Cohen, Robert (2003). \\"History of the Long Railroad Bridge Crossing Across the Potomac River.\\" National Railway Historical Society, Washington, D.C.

These subdivisions incorporated as the town of Potomac in 1908, but were annexed by the City of Alexandria in 1930. Potomac Yard in its heyday was one of the busiest railyards in the Eastern United States, processing thousands of cars daily. The PRR extended its railway electrification program to Potomac Yard in 1935, marking its southernmost point. The Penn Central segment of the famous Tropicana Juice Train operated from here. The site reached capacity in 1937. After the corporate mergers of the former separate railroad companies that used the yard to interchange freight cars, the need for Potomac Yard greatly diminished. It was determined by the RF&P; that the land was worth more than the need for yard switching. The PRR's old catenary was dismantled in the 1980s. The facility was identified as a toxic waste site in 1987. The RF&P; finally decommissioned it in 1989. Plans for rehabilitation and redevelopment of the land have been a source of intense debate since then.

Various commercial and community interest groups came into conflict over the future of the brownfield land. The City of Alexandria rejected the original mixed-use plan in 1992. Jack Kent Cooke, owner of the Washington Redskins, unsuccessfully pushed for the construction of a new football stadium on the site. Seventy of the 400 acres (1.6 km¬≤) of the site were approved for retail use in 1995; the Potomac Yard Center, a strip mall anchored by big box stores, was completed in 1997. Other sections of Potomac Yard have since been slated for development as residential units, office space, parkland, and retail use. The Potomac Yard Complex by Crescent Resources is already under construction. One and Two Potomac Center was completed in November 2005 and houses several EPA offices. The southernmost portion of the Alexandria section is under construction as of August 2006. It includes two plans, one for Arlington and one for Alexandria. The Alexandria portion of the site is highlighted by a new Town Center. The plan also includes of office space; a 625-room hotel; of neighborhood retail space; and approximately 1,900 residential units. The plan for the Arlington site includes of office space; a 625-room hotel; of neighborhood retail space; and approximately 1000 residential units. The plan also calls for a park, which will be owned by Arlington County. A mixed-use development apartment community called Station 650 was completed in 2015 in the Potomac Yard redevelopment of Alexandria, Virginia. The project by Wood Partners includes 183 residential units in a five story building with street level retail. Potomac Yard Park Construction for Potomac Yard Park began in 2009, and it opened on December 14, 2013. The park contains a water fountain, playgrounds, and sports fields within 24 acres.

Louis XIII style  In the early part of the 17th century, late mannerist and early Baroque tendencies continued to flourish in the court of Marie de' Medici and Louis XIII. Art from this period shows influences from both the north of Europe (Dutch and Flemish schools) and from Roman painters of the Counter-Reformation. Artists in France frequently debated the merits between Peter Paul Rubens (the Flemish baroque, voluptuous lines and colors) and Nicolas Poussin (rational control, proportion, Roman classicism). There was also a strong Caravaggio school represented in the period by the candle-lit paintings of Georges de La Tour. The wretched and the poor were featured in an almost Dutch manner in the paintings by the three Le Nain brothers. In the paintings of Philippe de Champaigne there are both propagandistic portraits of Louis XIII' s minister Cardinal Richelieu and other more contemplative portraits of people in the Jansenist sect.  Residential architecture  However, under Louis XIV, the Baroque as it was practiced in Italy was not in French taste (Bernini's famous proposal for redesigning the Louvre was rejected by Louis XIV.) Through propaganda, wars and great architectural works, Louis XIV launched a vast program designed for the glorification of France and his name. The Palace of Versailles, initially a tiny hunting lodge built by his father, was transformed by Louis XIV into a marvelous palace for f√™tes and parties. Architect Louis Le Vau, painter and designer Charles Le Brun and the landscape architect Andr√© Le N√¥tre created marvels : fountains danced; wandering revelers discovered hidden grottos in the gardens. The initial impetus for this transformation of Versailles is generally linked to the private ch√¢teau Vaux-le-Vicomte built for Louis XIV's minister of Finance Nicolas Fouquet. Having offered a lavish festival for the king in the newly finished residence in 1661 (Le Brun, Le Vau, Le N√¥tre, the poet La Fontaine, the playwright Moli√®re were all under Fouquet's patronage), the minister was accused of misappropriation of funds and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The architects and artists under his patronage were all put to work on Versailles. Versailles: Louis Le Vau's cour d'honneur The court of Louis XIV In this period, Louis' minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert established royal control over artisanal production in France; henceforth France would no longer purchase luxury goods from abroad, but would, herself, set the standard for quality. This control was also seen in the creation of an academy of painting and sculpture, which maintained a hierarchy of genres in painting (the \\"noblest,\\" according to Andr√© F√©libien in 1667, being history painting), a strong use of pictorial rhetoric, and a strict sense of decorum in subject matter. Furnishings and interior designs from this period are referred to as Louis XIV-style; the style is characterized by weighty brocades of red and gold, thickly gilded plaster molding, large sculpted sideboards, and heavy marbling. In 1682 Versailles was transformed into the official residence of the king; eventually the Hall of Mirrors was built; other smaller ch√¢teaux, like the Grand Trianon, were built on the grounds, and a huge canal featuring gondolas and gondoliers from Venice was created. Through his wars and the glory of Versailles, Louis became, to a certain degree, the arbiter of taste and power in Europe and both his ch√¢teau and the etiquette in Versailles were copied by the other European courts. Yet the difficult wars at the end of his long reign and the religious problems created by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes made his last years dark ones.

The band's line-up consists of vocalist and guitarist Justin Pierre, lead guitarist Joshua Cain, keyboardist Jesse Johnson, bassist Matthew Taylor, and drummer Tony Thaxton. Over the course of their career, the group has toured heavily and released six studio albums, the majority on independent label Epitaph Records. The band's sound, at times described as pop punk or emo, makes notable use of the Moog synthesizer. Pierre mainly handles the band's lyrics, which often touch on themes of anxiety, alienation, and relationships. The band was founded by Cain and Pierre, and it took several years to form a stable lineup. I Am the Movie, the group's debut album, was released in 2003. Their commercial breakthrough, Commit This to Memory, arrived in 2005, and its follow-up Even If It Kills Me (2007) was similarly successful. For many years, the band was a staple of the Warped Tour. They briefly signed to major label Columbia for My Dinosaur Life (2010), but rejoined Epitaph for Go in 2012. Their most recent effort, Panic Stations, was released in 2015. The group disbanded the following year, but they announced a reunion in 2019. HistoryFormation and early years (1997‚Äì03)= Motion City Soundtrack was formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1997 by singer- songwriter Justin Pierre and guitarist Joshua Cain. Previously, the duo had separately played in a number of bands. Cain was in a group named the Saddest Girl Story, and recruited Pierre to join as a singer. He was subsequently in a band called Boxcar, and following its dissolution, he and Pierre founded Motion City Soundtrack together. The band's name was created by Cain's brother, Brian. Their early days were difficult, as they found it hard to break out of their local scene. When they could get weeks off from their jobs, they would tour. According to Cain, the members of the band soon realized that there \\"wasn't really anywhere to play [shows] in Minneapolis\\", and that they would have to \\"tour all the time\\" to rise in popularity. In its early years, the group went through several lineup changes. Through these, Cain and Pierre would often have to take over keyboard duties during shows. The group's first release was a 7\\" single, \\"Promenade / Carolina\\", released in 1999. Their next two releases, both extended plays‚ÄîKids for America and Back to the Beat‚Äîwere released the following year. Over the course of the early 2000s, the band continued to tour and shuffle through members. In late 2001, while touring in Milton, Pennsylvania with the band Submerge, they convinced two of its members‚Äîbassist Matthew Taylor and drummer Tony Thaxton‚Äîto join Motion City. Thaxton initially took about a year to convince to join the band. Jesse Johnson, a friend and co-worker of Cain's, joined the band as keyboardist just three weeks before the band recorded their first album. Johnson had never played the keyboard before but Cain taught him the parts that had already been written. After their first attempt at self-recording an album failed, the band culled together $6,000 to record with producer Ed Rose, best known for his work with the Get Up Kids. They recorded much of their debut album, I Am the Movie, in ten days. Initial copies were hand-packaged inside floppy disks, which were sold out of the back of their tour van for a year. The band began receiving offers from various record labels, including Universal, Triple Crown Records, and Drive-Thru Records, and they performed at industry showcases. Meanwhile, Brett Gurewitz, founder of Epitaph Records, learned of the band from members of the group Matchbook Romance. He attended four of their shows in Los Angeles that Pierre later regarded as among his worst, as his voice was poor from constant touring. While they were interested in Universal, they chose to sign to Epitaph as they felt the contract was less restrictive and more honest. Eli Janney from Girls Against Boys helped the band secure management and a lawyer. Motion City became part of a slew of Epitaph signings, including Matchbook Romance, Scatter the Ashes and From First to Last, amid concerns the Southern California label had strayed too far from its roots, and seemed \\"a little too emo.\\" =Breakthrough and success (2003‚Äì06)= After signing with Epitaph, they recorded three new songs with the bands Reggie and the Full Effect and Ultimate Fakebook for a triple split EP which was never released. The new songs were added to the second release of I Am the Movie, which was released via Epitaph on June 24, 2003. Epitaph afforded the quartet wider distribution and a proper budget, which allowed them to re- record several songs on the album to match their original vision. During this time, the band visited the United Kingdom for the first time in 2003 while on tour with Sugarcult, followed by an inaugural stint on Warped Tour 2003. The band continued to tour heavily into the next year, with US dates alongside Rufio, Mae, and Fall Out Boy, plus Simple Plan and MxPx. A European leg‚Äîtitled the \\"Totally Wicked Awesome Tour\\"‚Äîfeatured the group with Sugarcult, the All- American Rejects, and Limbeck. That year, the band also filmed music videos for the singles \\"The Future Freaks Me Out\\" and \\"My Favorite Accident\\". Their fame grew concurrently with a second appearance on the Warped Tour 2004, where they were considered by fans to be a \\"must-see\\" act. The band performing in Denver, Colorado in 2005. The band joined Blink-182 for touring stints in Europe and Japan later in the year, at the recommendation of that band's bassist, Mark Hoppus. Cain invited Hoppus to produce Motion City's sophomore album, and he accepted. The album, Commit This to Memory, was recorded at Seedy Underbelly Studios, a suburban home converted into a studio in Los Angeles' Valley Village region. It was written partially in their hometown of Minneapolis and in Los Angeles, during a period in which Pierre was seeking treatment for alcohol abuse. Commit This to Memory was the first album by the band to feature material crafted by each musician in the group, as previous releases had featured songs written in the years prior to each member joining. In addition, the band also had more time and funds to create the album. During its recording process, Motion City embarked on their first headlining tour, titled \\"The Sub-Par Punk Who Cares Tour 2004\\". At the year's end, the band had played over 270 concerts. Commit This to Memory, which was leaked to file sharing websites months before its official debut, saw release on June 7, 2005, peaking at number two on Billboard Independent Albums chart. Pierre estimated that by 2015 the album had sold nearly 500,000 copies. The band's music videos found regular rotation on networks such as MTV2, and the band also performed on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. However, their mainstream breakthrough brought detractors, and they became a target for critics of pop punk: \\"[the band was] frequently characterized as the sort of ultra-commercial punk poseurs who water down the genre to the point of drowning it,\\" wrote Michael Roberts of Westword. The group continued to tour constantly, and started attracting larger crowds. They began the year with the inaugural Epitaph Tour, alongside Matchbook Romance and From First to Last. It was followed by dates on the Warped Tour 2005, and the Nintendo Fusion Tour with Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, and The Starting Line, which was their largest nationwide tour to that point. =Continued success (2007‚Äì11)= Drummer Tony Thaxton performing with the band in 2007. The band's follow-up, Even If It Kills Me (2007), was recorded in New York City with Eli Janney, Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne, and Ric Ocasek of the Cars. The group, though big fans of his work, were disappointed with Ocasek's role. \\"He just confused me the whole time,\\" said Pierre later, who noted that he was afraid to disclose that the experience was a \\"bum-out.\\" Pierre struggled with writer's block during the sessions and found himself writing lyrics while recording the songs, which he had never done before. The band was also worried their songs would not be catchy enough after their last album was so successful. During this time, Pierre's substance issues nearly disbanded the group. \\"I think it's an understatement to say it is tough to be tied to Justin's emotions,\\" Cain remarked at the time. Following completion of the album, Pierre entered a rehabilitation program for alcohol and drug abuse. The band was apart for a six-week stretch in mid-2007, marking their longest break apart in five years. \\"It might sound clich√©d, but we all had a chance to do some growing up,\\" said Cain. Even If It Kills Me was released on September 18, 2007 and represented a large leap from the group's last chart performance: it peaked at number 16 on the Billboard 200 and number one on the magazine's Independent Albums chart. \\"This Is for Real\\" became their best-charting single, peaking at number 48 in Australia. Cain later felt that the band placed far too much emphasis at the time on \\"numbers and trajectory instead of the creative process.\\" The following year saw a rise in profile for the band: they worked out promotional deals with Coca-Cola and Pepsi, their music was licensed in various television shows, movies, and video games, and they toured heavily. The band released an acoustic EP featuring songs from Even if It Kills Me in May 2008. After the release of that EP, the band toured on the Honda Civic Tour with Panic at the Disco and Phantom Planet, and then joined the last weeks of the Warped Tour 2008. In September, they headlined on The Left Handed Forms of Human Endeavor Tour. Motion City signed a multiple-album deal with Columbia Records several months before releasing their previous album. Following the move, the guitarist Joshua Cain said, \\"It just felt right to make the move when there was the right interest there.\\" With the new signing, the band's promotional team aimed to develop a balance between the benefits of a new major label and their previous grass-roots approach. Their next album saw the band reunite with producer Mark Hoppus, and the album was mostly recorded at his studio in North Hollywood, Opra Music, between April and June 2009. Hoppus said that the band wanted to follow in the tracks of Commit This to Memory, but to push things further. Pierre later recalled that the atmosphere in the studio was more loose than their first time working with Hoppus. The band picked the title My Dinosaur Life after a quote Pierre kept repeating‚Äîthey felt it a nice representation of the album's themes, which include growing old and feeling out of place. After completing the album, the band toured with Blink-182 on their reunion tour, and Pierre undertook a promotional tour called On the Dino Trail wherein he performed acoustic sets. Bassist Matthew Taylor on the Warped Tour in 2008. My Dinosaur Life was released to acclaim from music critics upon its debut on January 19, 2010, and it represented the band's all-time best chart performance, peaking at number 15 on the Billboard 200. They supported Weezer on several dates during this time, and they began a headlining tour in late January in the US. In the first three months following the album's release, the band continued to tour heavily: they traveled to Australia for the national Soundwave festival, as well as to Japan and the UK. The band also began to receive radio airplay for the first time in their career, and they released a music video for the single \\"Her Words Destroyed My Planet\\". The group embarked on a large tour with Say Anything between October and November 2010, and premiered a self-shot video for \\"A Lifeless Ordinary\\" during that time. Columbia dropped the band later that year, with the commercial performance of My Dinosaur Life leading to the split. \\"I guess we didn't do as well as they hoped or expected us to,\\" said Pierre that year. \\"And we felt that having all their resources at our disposal would perhaps propel us into another dimension. But we are what we are regardless of what label or machine is behind us. We did exceptionally well, though, if you want to look strictly at sales numbers in today's climate.\\" =Middle years (2012‚Äì16)= After being dropped by Columbia, the band set off to Brazil to support All Time Low in January 2011. They subsequently began recording their fifth studio album with producer and longtime friend Ed Ackerson at his studio, Flowers Studio, in Minneapolis. The band recorded on their own time with their own resources, which both provided comfort and a sense of nervousness to the group. They relaxed and took their time writing it, and did not preconceive the album as a change in style. \\"We just felt like it was like we were just taking our time and just kinda living life and not worrying about too much other than getting together and making music,\\" remarked Taylor. Pierre has since looked back on Go with mixed emotions, citing it as his personal least favorite album by the band. He noted that he was struggling with dark thoughts and felt that the band's collective misery translated to the record. Following the recording of Go, the band set out on the \\"4 Albums. 2 Nights. 7 Cities\\" tour, which found the band performing their past discography over two nights. They also covered \\"Wait So Long\\" by Trampled by Turtles for a split 7\\", which was released in November 2011. During that time period, they searched for a label to release Go, ultimately returning to Epitaph. Go was released on June 12, 2012 and received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. Its chart performance represented a large drop-off from its predecessors, peaking at number 46 on the Billboard 200 and number eight on the Independent Albums chart. \\"True Romance\\" was the album's lead single, and featured a one-shot music video reminiscent of the works of Spike Jonze. The group spent much of the remaining year on the road, including dates in Asia in mid-2012 and a headlining US tour in October and November. Drummer Tony Thaxton departed the group in March 2013 following battles with depression, due in part to their ceaseless touring schedule. The band enlisted longtime friend Claudio Rivera of Saves the Day as their new drummer, and released a one-off single with him, \\"Inside Out\\", in celebration. The band immediately began writing a new album, but progress was slow. The group shelved a group of demos they recorded with Mike Sapone, who also worked with Brand New. In the meantime, a video documentary, I Am the Movie: The Movie, was released in 2013. It mainly consists of footage shot of the band around the time of the album's creation. The group participated in Warped Tour 2013 and went on a co-headlining tour with Relient K that November. Motion City playing their penultimate show at Riot Fest in 2016. The group recorded their sixth album, Panic Stations, over two weeks at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota in June 2014. The group collaborated with producer John Agnello, well known for his work with Dinosaur Jr., Walt Mink, and Sonic Youth. The album was largely recorded live. The album's release was delayed by over a year, however, due to the birth of Pierre's daughter. In the interim, the group embarked on a tour celebrating the tenth anniversary of Commit This to Memory between January and February 2015, playing the album in its entirety. The band later extended this anniversary tour, and further toured the album between June and August 2015. Panic Stations was released on September 18, 2015 to positive reviews from music critics, but it debuted even lower on music charts than its predecessor. A tour with the Wonder Years followed between October and November 2015, and saw the release a split 7\\" between the two bands. As the band entered 2016, Cain felt the future for the group was bright: \\"We're not done yet. I think we got more music in us,\\" he told Substream Magazine in January 2016. Two months later the band announced their break-up with a statement that read in part, \\"We have no idea what the future holds, but for now we are done.\\" In interviews later that year, Pierre detailed the band's reasoning, noting that their exhaustion with touring and growing families contributed to their decision: \\"We‚Äôve done this one thing constantly for so many years nonstop. We all wanted to have something else to look ahead to in our lives.\\" The band embarked on the So Long, Farewell Tour across North America between May and September 2016 with original drummer Tony Thaxton returning. It concluded with a sold-out show at the Metro in Chicago on September 18, 2016. The group performed 36 songs ‚Äî some dating back to their 2000 EP, Back to the Beat ‚Äî while both Thaxton and Rivera sat in on drums. =Reunion (2019‚Äìpresent)= During their three-year break, all of the members moved to different states and pursued different interests. Pierre continued to record music and tour as a solo act, issuing his debut effort In the Drink in 2018, which Cain assisted him in producing. The following June, the band announced their reformation with a U.S. tour. In an interview, Pierre explained their inactivity had given rise to an \\"excitement\\" to focus on the band again. The tour, named \\"Don't Call It a Comeback\\" for a song on their debut album, took place in January 2020. Thaxton returned to the band in an official capacity for the tour. The band were scheduled to travel to the U.K. for the Slam Dunk Festival in May, but plans were shelved due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That same year, the group released three new songs. The first, a cover of Fountains of Wayne's \\"A Dip in the Ocean\\", debuted on a tribute compilation celebrating the life of musician Adam Schlesinger. Midway through the year, the quartet issued a previously unreleased track, \\"Crooked Ways\\"; it was recorded a decade prior and submitted for consideration for inclusion in the Twilight film saga. Author Stephenie Meyer, in a blog post, suggested it was inspiration for her novel Midnight Sun. Lastly, the group recorded a cover of Ed Ackerson's \\"Wired Weird\\" for a tribute album to Ackerson, who produced their 2012 album Go and who had died in 2019. Cain has claimed there is \\"no official plan\\" for further music, though he believes the band is not entirely finished making new music. Musical style and influencesMusic= moogstand\\" in 2008. The band's array of influences mostly include alternative indie rock bands Superchunk, Jawbox, Sunny Day Real Estate, the Flaming Lips, Fugazi, and Pavement. Additional artists that inspired the band includes Braid and The Rentals, Elvis Costello, Pixies, Tom Waits, Ben Folds, the Weakerthans, Poster Children, the Carpenters, and the Cardigans. AllMusic additionally credits bands such as Weezer and the Get Up Kids as influences, among others. Pierre quoted Waits that \\"all anybody ever does is imitate their favorite artist‚Äîbadly,\\" adding, \\"we're just regurgitating all the crap we listened to in the late '80s and early '90s, the music that got us into playing music in the first place.\\" The band's musical style is widely recognizable by its unique blend of pop punk with the Moog synthesizer. The usage of the Moog stems from Cain, who first heard the instrument employed on the Rentals' album Return of the Rentals (1995). He subsequently bought a cheap Moog at a pawn shop and wanted it to be an integral part of Motion City upon their formation. Johnson became known for his signature \\"Moogstand\\" in live performances, which consisted of a handstand on the instrument. The group has been widely attributed to a number of different genres, including pop rock, power pop, indie rock, emo, and pop punk. Joshua Cain dismissed this latter label, remarking, \\"I definitely wouldn't consider us a pop-punk band. Our influences are more based on '90s bands like Superchunk and early Weezer.\\" Pierre characterized the band's music as \\"dirty, fast, happy, emotional rock songs.\\" Nylon compared the music of their debut album, I Am the Movie, to All and the Get Up Kids. It has been described as having a \\"distinctly unified and identifiable style.\\" Subsequent releases varied in style. My Dinosaur Life, for example, saw the band attempting to emulate their favorite post-hardcore acts, such as Archers of Loaf and Dinosaur Jr. =Lyrics= Justin Pierre, frontman and primary lyricist for the band, in 2010. Most of Motion City Soundtrack's lyrical content was written by lead vocalist, Justin Pierre. This material was largely affected by his personal life and past experiences. Songs came about in myriad ways. Many times, the band would write music first that Pierre would set words to, other times Pierre would write a song on guitar with words and bring it to the band. Pierre could often \\"spend hours and days and weeks and months on lyrics‚Äîsometimes they come quick, sometimes they don't come at all,\\" he said. He noted that he had a screenwriting teacher in film school that taught him to \\"write what you know,\\" but in his case, he could only write about \\"being a self-obsessed pessimistic sort of loser.\\" This led him to characterize his writing as a sort of therapy for him and a vehicle to better understand the human condition. Commit This to Memory \\"addresses the themes of substance abuse, psychological disorders and failing relationships.\\" For the record, he intended to simplify his lyrics to enhance storytelling and he drew inspiration from Tom Waits, Ben Folds, and John K. Samson's writing styles. In some cases, he chose to write from another individual's point of view, rather than his own. Their next album, Even If It Kills Me, was Pierre's first \\"written completely sober, after battling drugs and alcohol for years;\\" consequently, the record is more optimistic and less self-loathing. My Dinosaur Life has lyrics relating to relationships, procrastination, and Pierre's own desire for a life away from his self-destructive behavior. Much of the lyricism on fifth album Go is consumed with death and \\"the eventual demise of everything.\\" The idea that \\"nothing lasts forever\\" is one of the album's most important points. Honors and awards First Avenue The band has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \\"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\\" according to journalist Steve Marsh.

History In France, the death of Louis XIV in September 1715 led to a period of licentious freedom commonly called the R√©gence. The heir to Louis XIV, his great grandson Louis XV of France, was only 5 years old; for the next seven years France was ruled by the regent Philippe II of Orl√©ans. Versailles was abandoned from 1715 to 1722. Painting turned toward \\"f√™tes galantes\\", theater settings and the female nude. Painters from this period include Antoine Watteau, Nicolas Lancret and Fran√ßois Boucher. One of the best places in the UK to see examples of French visual and decorative arts of the Rococo and neoclassical periods is in the Wallace Collection, a free national gallery in London. The Louis XV style of decoration (although already apparent at the end of the last reign) was lighter: pastels and wood panels, smaller rooms, less gilding and fewer brocades; shells and garlands and occasional Chinese subjects predominated. Rooms were more intimate. After the return to Versailles, many of the baroque rooms of Louis XIV were redesigned. The official etiquette was also simplified and the notion of privacy was expanded: the king himself retreated from the official bed at night and conversed in private with his mistress. The latter half of the 18th century continued to see French preeminence in Europe, particularly through the arts and sciences, and the French language was the lingua franca of the European courts. The French academic system continued to produce artists, but some, like Jean-Honor√© Fragonard and Jean-Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin, explored new and increasingly impressionist styles of painting with thick brushwork. Although the hierarchy of genres continued to be respected officially, genre painting, landscape, portrait and still life were extremely fashionable. The writer Denis Diderot wrote a number of times on the annual Salons of the Acad√©mie of painting and sculpture and his comments and criticisms are a vital document on the arts of this period. One of Diderot's favorite painters was Jean-Baptiste Greuze. Although often considered kitsch by today's standards, his paintings of domestic scenes reveal the importance of Sentimentalism in the European arts of the period (as also seen in the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Samuel Richardson.) One also finds in this period a kind of Pre-romanticism. Hubert Robert's images of ruins, inspired by Italian capriccio paintings, are typical in this respect. So too the change from the rational and geometrical French garden (of Andr√© Le N√¥tre) to the English garden, which emphasized (artificially) wild and irrational nature. One also finds in some of these gardens curious ruins of temples called follies. The middle of the 18th century saw a turn to Neoclassicism in France, that is to say a conscious use of Greek and Roman forms and iconography. In painting, the greatest representative of this style is Jacques-Louis David who, mirroring the profiles of Greek vases, emphasized the use of the profile; his subject matter often involved classical history (the death of Socrates, Brutus). The dignity and subject matter of his paintings were greatly inspired by Nicolas Poussin in the 17th century. The Louis XVI style of furniture (once again already present in the previous reign) tended toward circles and ovals in chair backs; chair legs were grooved; Greek inspired iconography was used as decoration. French neoclassicism would greatly contribute to the monumentalism of the French revolution, as typified in the structures La Madeleine church (begun in 1763 and finished in 1840) which is in the form of a Greek temple and the mammoth Panth√©on (1764‚Äì1812) which today houses the tombs of great Frenchmen. The rationalism and simplicity of classical architecture was seen -- in the Age of Enlightenment -- as the antithesis of the backward-looking Gothic. The Greek and Roman subject matters were also often chosen to promote the values of republicanism. One also finds paintings glorifying the heroes and martyrs of the French revolution, such as David's painting of the assassination of Jean-Paul Marat. Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, a student of David's who was also influenced by Raphael and John Flaxman, would maintain the precision of David's style, while also exploring other mythological (Oedipus and the sphinx, Jupiter and Thetis) and oriental (the Odalesques) subjects in the spirit of Romanticism.

Macrinus' predecessor, Caracalla, was murdered by a disaffected soldier during a campaign against Parthia on 8 April 217. Macrinus himself may have had a hand in the murder of Caracalla. Within days of Caracalla's death, Macrinus was proclaimed emperor with the support of the army. At the time of his accession he inherited all of the problems that Caracalla had left for Rome‚Äîwar against Parthia, threats from Armenia and Dacia, and extensive fiscal expenditures. Macrinus successfully concluded a peace with Parthia, but it came at considerable cost to Rome. Finally, his policies to reduce monetary expenditures only stoked discontent within the military. Caracalla's mother's sister, Julia Maesa, took advantage of the discontent of the soldiers and spent from her wealth to champion her grandson Elagabalus as the rightful heir to the empire. Elagabalus, chief priest of the god Elagabal, was proclaimed emperor by the soldiers of Legio III Gallica (Gallic Third Legion) at their camp in Raphanea on 16 May 218. In response, Macrinus sent one of his generals, Ulpius Julianus, with a small cavalry force to quell the rebellious soldiers. The cavalry defected and killed Ulpius Julianus, sending his head back to Macrinus in Antioch. The decisive battle took place less than a month later. While Gannys had the numerical advantage, in the opening stages of the battle Macrinus' Praetorian Guards broke through Gannys' lines, and the latter's troops began to flee. In response, Elagabalus' mother and grandmother joined the battle and rallied the troops while Gannys led his own charge. Gannys' troops turned and renewed the assault, causing Macrinus to flee the battle in fear and return to Antioch. He sent his son and co-emperor, Diadumenian, to Parthia and tried to return to Rome. Both he and his son were caught en route and executed. Elagabalus entered Antioch as the new emperor of Rome, and with Macrinus dead, the Senate had no choice but to acknowledge the ascension of Elagabalus. By March 222, Elagabalus was himself killed by the disgruntled Praetorian Guard, declared an enemy of Rome and subjected to a damnatio memoriae.  Background  Death of Caracalla and rise of Macrinus = Roman denarius depicting Macrinus and his son, Diadumenian Macrinus' predecessor Caracalla was murdered on April 8, 217, during a period of war with the Parthians, near Carrhae while traveling en route to visit a temple. His murderer was Justin Martialus, a soldier who was incensed after being declined the rank of centurion. Martialus was himself cut down by Caracalla's German Guards immediately afterwards, a convenient fact for Macrinus, at the time a praetorian prefect, who was involved in the assassination. One reason for Macrinus to have intrigued against Caracalla was out of fear for his own life. A story documented by the Roman writer Herodian and supported by some later historians details the events leading to Caracalla's death. The story goes that Macrinus, in the course of his employment, was often tasked with reading dispatches sent to Caracalla for him. One such dispatch detailed a prophecy, perhaps fabricated, from the oracle at Delphi suggesting that Macrinus was destined to kill Caracalla and succeed him as emperor. In the immediate aftermath of Caracalla's death, Adventus was selected to serve as emperor, but he declined the position due to his old age. The army then chose Macrinus; they had no feelings of 'love or esteem' towards him, but there was no one else competing for the position. The army proclaimed Macrinus as emperor three days after the death of Caracalla, and named him Augustus. The results were applauded by the Senate at first, who were glad to be rid of the former emperor. But tradition held that the emperor could only be selected from among the Senate; moreover, Macrinus was a member of the equestrian class, the lower of the two aristocratic classes. These disadvantages led the Senate to severely scrutinize his every action. Their opposition, however, was not backed by any actual power. The military at the time was concentrated against the Parthians in the area around Edessa (modern ≈ûanlƒ±urfa, Turkey), so there was no force anywhere in the Empire that could contest the status of Macrinus. As the new emperor, Macrinus had to deal with the major threat of the Parthians, with whom Rome were currently at war. An indecisive battle at Nisibis is cited as a reason for the opening of peace negotiations. Negotiations may have been favourable for both sides; Rome was being threatened by Armenia and Dacia, and the Parthians were far from home and low on supplies. The settlement, however, was viewed by many people as being unfavourable to Rome. The Roman historian Cassius Dio wrote that a concession of 200 million Sesterces was rendered to the Parthians in exchange for peace. Historian Andrew Scott doubts the credibility of this high figure, noting that Dio's records are frequently unreliable on finances. Regardless, the prevailing opinion accuses Macrinus of being cowardly and weak during negotiations. With the peace treaty concluded, Macrinus took measures to control the expenditures of Rome, by reversing Caracalla's changes and thus effectively reinstating the fiscal policies of Septimius Severus. This included a reduction in pay and benefits for legionaries, which was not popular with the army who had placed him in command. These policies applied only to new recruits, but the enlisted soldiers saw this as setting precedent for further changes to the fiscal policies brought in by Caracalla. The sullen behaviour of new recruits, who entered service committing to greater labour for less payment, only furthered discontent among the soldiers. Edward Gibbon suggests that from here only a small spark was required to ignite a rebellion. = Rise of Elagabalus = Following the death of Caracalla, Macrinus allowed Caracalla's mother, Julia Domna, and his aunt, Julia Maesa, to settle in their home town of Emesa. Julia Domna, who was working in Antioch at the time of Caracalla's death, attempted suicide and eventually succeeded by starving herself. Her sister Julia Maesa, however, returned to Emesa with her family finances intact. Julia's suspicions regarding Macrinus' involvement in the death of Caracalla led to her championing the case of her grandson, Elagabalus, as the rightful emperor. At the time Elagabalus was the chief priest of the Phoenician god Elagabal in Emesa. The soldiers nearby frequently visited the temple where Elagabalus was chief priest, to watch him perform his rituals and ceremonies. At one of these visits, Julia Maesa took the opportunity to inform the soldiers, it is not known whether truthfully, that Elagabalus was Caracalla's son. Simultaneously, she may have seen the opportunity to use her family's wealth and prestige to set in motion her plot. On the night of 15 May 218, Elagabalus was taken, by either Julia Maesa or Gannys, to the camp of the Legio III Gallica at Raphanea and presented to the soldiers stationed there. In one account of the events, Elegabalus was saluted as Antoninus by the soldiers, after his supposed father Caracalla whose official name was Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. Enticed by Julia's bribes, the legion proclaimed Elagabalus the rightful Emperor of Rome on 16 May 218. In Gibbon's opinion, Macrinus might have been able to stop the rebellion in this early stage, but failed to contain it because he was unable to decide on an appropriate course of action and instead remained at Antioch. = Rebellion = With the support of an entire legion, other legionaries, prompted by discontent over pay, deserted Macrinus and joined Elagabalus' ranks as well. In response to the growing threat, Macrinus sent out a cavalry force under the command of Ulpius Julianus to try and regain control of the rebel soldiers. Rather than capturing the rebel forces, the cavalry instead killed Ulpius and defected to Elagabalus. Following these events, Macrinus traveled to Apamea to ensure the loyalty of Legio II Parthica before setting off to march against Emesa. According to Dio, Macrinus appointed his son Diadumenian to the position of Imperator, and promised the soldiers 20,000 Sesterces each, with 4,000 of these to be paid on the spot. Dio further comments that Macrinus hosted a dinner for the residents of Apamea in honour of Diadumenian. At the dinner, Macrinus was supposedly presented with the head of Ulpius Julianus who had been killed by his soldiers. In response, Macrinus left Apamea headed south. Macrinus' and Elagabalus' troops met somewhere near the border of Syria Coele and Syria Phoenice. Despite Macrinus' efforts to quell the rebellion at this engagement, his whole legion defected to Elagabalus forcing Macrinus to retire to Antioch. Elagabus took to the offensive and marched on Antioch. = Senatorial response = By the early third century, the balance of power had shifted from the Senate to the army, and the position of the Senate was considerably weakened. The emperor of Rome was appointed by the support of the military, while the Senate existed solely to officiate state affairs without any real authority. Both Macrinus and later Elagabalus secured the support of the military while generally disregarding the opinion of the Senate. Macrinus was in dire circumstances after Elagabalus' rebellion and had no other choice but to turn to the Senate for assistance. While in Antioch, Macrinus made one final attempt at securing support, this time from Rome. A combination of distrust from the Senate, insufficient funds, and Elagabalus' impending approach, however, forced Macrinus to face Elagabalus' approaching legions with only his Praetorian Guard. Had more time had been available, the Urban Prefect of Rome, Marius Maximus, might have been able to muster troops to send as reinforcements to assist Macrinus. Despite their relative powerlessness, the Senate still declared war against the usurper and his family.  Battle  Descriptions of the battle differ, and its location is debated. The decisive and perhaps sole engagement took place on 8June 218; Dio places it at a defile outside of a village believed to be Immae, approximately twenty-four miles or so by road between Antioch and Beroea. Herodian challenges this assertion, suggesting that the battle took place closer to the borders of Syria Coele and Syria Phoenice, possibly near Emesa. Downey then suggests that two battles took place: an initial engagement matching the one described by Herodian, and a later battle near Antioch, which Downey agrees was the decisive point in the rebellion. Other historians either support Dio's suggested site near Antioch or make no claim with regards to the location of the engagement. Elagabalus' armies, commanded by the inexperienced but determined Gannys, engaged Macrinus' Praetorian Guard in a narrowly fought pitched battle. Gannys commanded at least two full legions and held numerical superiority over the fewer levies that Macrinus had been able to raise. Nonetheless, the engagement began in Macrinus' favour. According to Dio, Macrinus had ordered the Praetorian Guard to set aside their scale armour breastplates and grooved shields in favour of lighter oval shields prior to the battle. This made them lighter and more manoeuvrable and negated any advantage the legionary lanciarii (javelin-armed light infantry) had. The Praetorian Guards broke through the lines of Gannys' force, which turned to flee. During the retreat, however, Julia Maesa and Soaemias Bassiana (Elagabalus' mother) joined the fray to rally the forces while Gannys charged on horseback headlong into the enemy. These actions effectively ended the retreat; the troops resumed the assault with renewed morale, turning the tide of battle. Fearing defeat, Macrinus fled back to the city of Antioch. Both Downey and Gibbon suggest that had Macrinus not fled, he might have eventually gained victory and secured his position as emperor.  Aftermath  After his defeat, Macrinus sent his son Diadumenian to Artabanus V of Parthia, while he himself returned to Antioch, proclaiming himself victorious over Elagabalus in battle. News of Macrinus' defeat spread and many civilians who had supported him were slain in the city and on the roads. Macrinus shaved off his beard and hair to disguise himself as a member of the military police. Fleeing the city at night on horseback, he reached Cilicia with a few companions, masquerading as a military courier, and secured a carriage to drive to Eribolon, near Nicomedia. From there he set sail for Chalcedon. Macrinus travelled through Cappadocia, Galatia and Bithynia before arriving in Chalcedon. Here he was arrested, his guise revealed after he had sent requests for money. Men dispatched by Elagabalus apprehended Macrinus and brought him to Cappadocia. Diadumenian was captured elsewhere on his journey to Parthia, and killed by the centurion Cladius Pollio in Zeugma. French author Jean-Baptiste Crevier comments that Macrinus threw himself out of the carriage at Cappadocia after receiving the news of the death of his son, breaking his shoulder in the act. Macrinus was executed in Archelais in Cappadocia after attempting to escape; Dio mentions that the centurion Marcianus Taurus was responsible for his execution. Thus, the reign of Macrinus as emperor of Rome ended after nearly fourteen months. In the meantime, Elagabalus had entered Antioch and declared himself the new ruler of Rome in a message to the Roman Senate and people. Once again, as they had done with Macrinus, the Senate were forced to recognize Elagabalus as the new emperor. Elagabalus' claim was not uncontested, as several others made their own bids for the imperial purple. These included Verus, the commander of LegioIII Gallica and Gellius Maximus, the commander of Legio IV Scythica. History professor and author Martijn Icks notes the irony of Verus' claim as his legion had been the first to proclaim Elagabalus as the rightful emperor of Rome. These rebellions were quashed and their instigators executed. By March 222 A.D., Elagabalus was himself murdered by the Praetorian Guard, his body dumped in the river Tiber and his memory condemned by damnatio memoriae ordered by the senate.

With the formula R2As(O)OH, it is the simplest of the organoarsinic acids. It is a colorless solid that is soluble in water. Neutralization of cacodylic acid with base gives cacodylate salts, e.g. sodium cacodylate. They are potent herbicides. Cacodylic acid/sodium cacodylate is a buffering agent in the preparation and fixation of biological samples for electron microscopy.  History  In the 18th century it was found that combining As2O3 and four equivalents of potassium acetate (CH3CO2K) gives a product called \\"Cadet's fuming liquid\\" which contains cacodyl oxide, ((CH3)2As)2O and cacodyl, ((CH3)2As)2. Early research into \\"cacodyls\\" was reported by Robert Bunsen at the University of Marburg. Bunsen said of the compounds, \\"the smell of this body produces instantaneous tingling of the hands and feet, and even giddiness and insensibility...It is remarkable that when one is exposed to the smell of these compounds the tongue becomes covered with a black coating, even when no further evil effects are noticeable\\". His work in this field led to an increased understanding of the methyl group. Cacodyl oxide, ((CH3)2As)2O, is often considered the first organometallic compound to be prepared synthetically. Cacodylic acid and its salts were incorporated into herbicides by large variety of manufacturers under numerous brand names. APC Holdings Corp. sold cacodylic acid and its salts under the Phytar brand name. The variety used in Vietnam (as Agent Blue) was Phytar 560G. \\"Agent Blue,\\" a mixture of cacodylic acid and sodium cacodylate was used during the Vietnam War as a defoliant. Reactions Cacodylic acid is a weak acid with a pKa of 6.

This is necessary because, while the brake fluid is an incompressible liquid, air bubbles are compressible gas and their presence in the brake system greatly reduces the hydraulic pressure that can be developed within the system. The same methods used for bleeding are also used for brake flushing or purging, where the old fluid is replaced with new fluid, which is necessary maintenance. Methods The process is performed by forcing clean, bubble- free brake fluid through the entire system, usually from the master cylinder(s) to the calipers of disc brakes (or the wheel cylinders of drum brakes), but in certain cases in the opposite direction. A brake bleed screw is normally mounted at the highest point on each cylinder or caliper. There are five main methods of bleeding:Brake Bleeding Methods by Phoenix Systems *The pump and hold method, the brake pedal is pressed while one bleed screw at a time is opened, allowing air to escape. The bleed screw must be closed before releasing the pedal, or a one-way valve must be fitted. *In the vacuum method, a vacuum pump is attached to the bleeder valve, which is opened and fluid extracted with the pump until it runs clear of bubbles. *In the pressure method, a pressure pump is attached to the master cylinder, pressurizing the system, and the bleeder valves are opened one at a time until the fluid is clear of air. Specialised pumps may incorporate a method to automatically keep the brake fluid reservoir full during bleeding. *In the reverse method, a pump is used to force fluid through the bleeder valve to the master cylinder. This method uses the concept that air rises in liquid and naturally wants to escape up and out of the brake system. *Gravity bleeding is a simple and easy method replace automotive brake fluid. It can also be used to bleed systems containing air bubbles but may not be as effective as other methods. Pros and cons of different methods The pump and hold method usually requires two people, although it can be performed by one person if one-way bleed nipples or valves are fitted. During this method, the brake pedal and master cylinder piston will travel beyond their normal range which can cause wear on seals or incorporate corroded metal into the brake fluid. Multiple wheel cylinders or calipers can be bled simultaneously, although this is only usually done with the gravity method which doesn't require pumps. The gravity method does take a long time, typically several hours to replace all the fluid. Bubbles in the system may rise faster than the fluid drains, so it may not be effective at bleeding, but is generally sufficient for replacing old fluid with new. Gravity bleeding is a very simple method requiring only one person. When the reservoir cap is removed and a bleed nipple opened, fluid drips slowly from the nipple because it is lower than the reservoir. A hose is typically used to collect the fluid in a container for safe disposal. The reservoir must be kept above the min mark at all times to avoid more air being drawn into the system. Applying pressure to the reservoir or bleed nipples, or applying a vacuum to the bleed nipples, makes the fluid flow through much more quickly than gravity alone. Replacing all the fluid takes only a few minutes. Different vehicles have different recommended bleeding patterns. Brakes are usually bled starting with the wheel that is furthest from the master cylinder and working towards the wheel closest to the master cylinder. This prevents bubbles in the system being forced into pipes towards wheels that have already been bled. Bench bleeding After replacement of the master cylinder, the master cylinder is usually \\"bench bled\\" before installation. Typically by securing it on the bench, filling it with fluid, connecting fittings and hoses to route fluid from the outlet ports on the master cylinder back to its reservoir, and repeatedly depressing the master cylinder plunger until bubbles are no longer seen coming from the hoses. Clutch bleeding The same techniques are used for bleeding hydraulic clutch systems. A bleed nipple on the clutch slave cylinder is used. Gravity bleeding is often not effective because of the layout of the clutch pipework.

He is known for his work as executive producer and showrunner of the animated sitcom The Simpsons from 1997 to 2001. Scully grew up in West Springfield, Massachusetts and long had an interest in writing. He was an underachiever at school and dropped out of college, going on to work in a series of jobs. Eventually, in 1986, he moved to Los Angeles where he worked as a stand-up comic and wrote for Yakov Smirnoff. Scully went on to write for several television sitcoms before 1993, when he was hired to write for The Simpsons. There, he wrote twelve episodes, including \\"Lisa on Ice\\" and \\"Team Homer\\", and served as showrunner from seasons 9 to 12. Scully won three Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on the series, with many publications praising his episodes, but others criticizing his tenure as a period of decline in the show's quality. Scully still works on the show and also co- wrote 2007's The Simpsons Movie. More recently, Scully co-created The Pitts and Complete Savages as well as working on Everybody Loves Raymond and Parks and Recreation. He co-developed the short-lived animated television version of Napoleon Dynamite. Scully is married to fellow writer Julie Thacker. Early life Scully was born October 2, 1956 at Springfield Hospital in Springfield, Massachusetts and grew up in the Merrick section of West Springfield. His father, Richard, was a salesman and owned a dry cleaning business, his mother Geraldine (d. 1985) worked for the Baystate Medical Center once Scully and his brothers were old enough to be left at home alone. Scully is of Irish ancestry. As a child he \\"hoped to be a musician or a hockey player.\\" At Main Street Elementary School, with the encouragement of his teacher James Doyle, he developed an interest in writing, serving as editor for his school newspaper. He graduated from West Springfield High School in 1974, having been voted \\"Most Likely Not to Live Up to Potential\\" by his classmates, and dropped out of Holyoke Community College after one day, undecided about what he wanted to do with his life. He took up work in the clothing department at Steiger's department store, as a janitor at the Baystate Medical Center and also as a driving instructor. He commented: \\"I think if I had actually succeeded at college and gotten a degree in accounting or something, I might have given up too quickly on writing. Having no marketable job skills was a tremendous incentive to keep trying to succeed as a writer.\\" He realized \\"there probably wasn't going to be a career in riding around with my friends listening to Foghat,\\" so Scully decided he \\"definitely wanted to break into comedy\\" even though he \\"really had no reason to believe [he] could succeed.\\" Regardless, he moved to Los Angeles, California in 1982. CareerEarly career= In California, Scully worked in a tuxedo store. He also got a job writing jokes for comedian Yakov Smirnoff and developed his joke writing skills by performing himself at amateur stand-up comedy nights. He purchased scripts from a variety of half-hour comedy shows, including Taxi, to train himself to write them and had numerous speculative scripts rejected. He started \\"bouncing around Hollywood working on some of the lousiest sitcoms in history.\\" He served on the writing staff of The Royal Family, Out of This World, Top of the Heap and What a Country!, where he did audience warm-up, a role he also performed on Grand. =The Simpsons= In 1993, David Mirkin hired Scully to write for The Simpsons, as a replacement for the departing Conan O'Brien, after reading some of his sample scripts. He began as a writer and producer for the show during its fifth season and wrote the episodes \\"Lisa's Rival\\", \\"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\\" and \\"Lisa on Ice\\" which aired in season six. \\"Lisa's Rival\\" was his first episode; he wrote the script, but the original concept had been conceived by O'Brien. Similarly, he wrote the script for \\"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\\", which was based on an idea by Al Jean and Mike Reiss. \\"Lisa on Ice\\" was inspired by Scully's love of ice hockey and featured many experiences from his childhood, as was \\"Marge Be Not Proud\\" (which he wrote for season seven) which was based \\"one of the most traumatic moments\\" of his life, when he was caught shoplifting at age 12. He jokingly told Variety that \\"It's great to be paid for reliving the horrors of your life.\\" He also wrote \\"Team Homer\\" and \\"Lisa's Date with Density\\". Scully noted: \\"I wrote a lot of Lisa's shows. I have five daughters, so I like Lisa a lot. I like Homer, too. Homer comes very naturally to me: I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing. A lot of my favorite episodes are the ones when Homer and Lisa are in conflict with each other ... They're very human, I think that's their appeal.\\" Scully became showrunner of The Simpsons in 1997, during its ninth season. As showrunner and executive producer, Scully said his aim was to \\"not wreck the show\\", and he headed up the writing staff and oversaw all aspects of the show's production. During his time as showrunner he was credited with writing or co-writing five episodes: \\"Treehouse of Horror VIII\\" (\\"The HŒ©mega Man\\" segment), \\"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\\", \\"Beyond Blunderdome\\", \\"Behind the Laughter\\" and \\"The Parent Rap\\". Scully was popular with the staff members, many of whom praised his organization and management skills. Writer Tom Martin said he was \\"quite possibly the best boss I've ever worked for\\" and \\"a great manager of people\\" while Don Payne commented that for Scully \\"it was really important that we kept decent hours\\". Scully served as showrunner until 2001, during season 12, making him the first person to run the show for more than two seasons. He returned in season 14 to write and executive produce the episode \\"How I Spent My Strummer Vacation\\", and co-wrote and co-produced The Simpsons Movie in 2007. On the main page, click on \\"About the DVD\\" then on \\"Production Notes\\". Scully in July 2007, at the premiere of The Simpsons Movie in Springfield, Vermont Scully's tenure as showrunner of The Simpsons has been the subject of criticism from some of the show's fans. John Ortved wrote \\"Scully's episodes excel when compared to what The Simpsons airs nowadays, but he was the man at the helm when the ship turned towards the iceberg.\\" The BBC noted \\"the common consensus is that The Simpsons' golden era ended after season nine\\", while an op-ed in Slate by Chris Suellentrop argued The Simpsons changed from a realistic show about family life into a typical cartoon during Scully's years: \\"Under Scully's tenure, The Simpsons became, well, a cartoon. ... Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset (perhaps while Bart gagged in the background) now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck.\\" The Simpsons under Scully has been negatively labelled as a \\"gag-heavy, Homer-centric incarnation\\" by Jon Bonn√© of MSNBC, while some fans have bemoaned the transformation in Homer's character during the era, from sweet and sincere to \\"a boorish, self- aggrandizing oaf\\", dubbing him \\"Jerkass Homer\\". Despite this, much of Scully's work on the show also received critical praise. Scully won five Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on The Simpsons, while Entertainment Weekly cited \\"How I Spent My Strummer Vacation\\" as the show's 22nd best episode. Robert Canning of IGN also gave the episode a positive review, something he also did for \\"Behind the Laughter\\" and \\"Trilogy of Error\\", which aired during season 12. He called the latter: \\"one extremely enjoyable misadventure. The Simpsons may have peaked in the '90s, but that doesn't mean the eight years since haven't delivered their share of quality episodes. This was one of them.\\" Martin said that he does not understand the criticism against Scully, and that he thinks the criticism \\"bothered [him], and still bothers him, but he managed to not get worked up over it.\\" Ortved noted in his book that blaming a single show runner for what some perceive as the lowering quality of the show \\"is unfair.\\" When asked in 2007 how the series' longevity is sustained, Scully joked, \\"Lower your quality standards. Once you've done that you can go on forever.\\" =Further career= Scully was a writer and co-executive producer on Everybody Loves Raymond for part of season seven and all of season eight, winning an Emmy for his work. Scully co-created (with wife Julie Thacker) The Pitts for Fox and Complete Savages for ABC, which was produced by Mel Gibson. The Pitts was a sitcom about a family suffering from bad luck. Thacker stated the show was designed \\"as a companion piece for The Simpsons. It had a very cartoony feel to it. We always knew the initial audience for the show would be 12-year-olds to start, and then when families saw that the writing was very Simpsons - like, because many of the writers were from The Simpsons, [we thought] families would start to watch it together.\\" It was canceled after six episodes; Scully and Thacker laid the blame for this on the show's timeslot, 9:30 P.M., which was too late for the target audience. Complete Savages, which Thacker and Scully wrote with the \\"Simpsons sensibility\\" of layered jokes, was canceled in January 2005 due to low ratings and network anger at Scully and Thacker's decision to write to TV critics in what the Hartford Courant labelled \\"unsanctioned promoting\\". A fan of NRBQ, Scully produced, with Thacker, a documentary about the band in 2003 entitled NRBQ: Rock 'n' Roll's Best Kept Secret; Scully employed the group as the \\"unofficial house band\\" of The Simpsons during his tenure as showrunner. Scully also created a pilot for Fox called Schimmel in 2000, starring Robert Schimmel, which was dropped after Schimmel was diagnosed with cancer. Scully served as a consulting producer on the NBC series Parks and Recreation, and wrote the episodes \\"Ron and Tammy\\" in 2009, and \\"The Possum\\" in 2010. Scully also had cameo roles in the episodes \\"Eagleton\\" and \\"Soda Tax\\" as a speaker at the Pawnee community meeting. In 2012, Scully co-produced and co-wrote an animated TV version of the film Napoleon Dynamite, which was canceled after six episodes. That May, Scully signed a seven-figure, multi-year overall deal with 20th Century Fox Television to develop several projects.

He was the second son of President Ulysses S. Grant. Early life and education Grant was born in Bethel, Ohio, on July 22, 1852. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1870, Harvard University in 1874, and Columbia Law School in 1876. Career Grant served as personal secretary to his father while he was president, and as Assistant United States Attorney in New York. Grant then worked in private practice and became wealthy. He partnered in a banking and brokerage firm with Ferdinand Ward. Grant and his father each put $100,000 in the firm and asked veterans and millionaires to invest. The Grants thought that they would share one-half of the profits from the firm, but realized that Ward was only interested in using the Grant name for his own interests. In 1884, the firm went bankrupt, and the Grants lost everything. Ward was convicted of fraud and served over 6 years in prison. Grant Sr. died the next year; Grant Jr. was never tried. =Real estate= When Buck was back on his feet financially, he bought Merryweather Farm in Salem Center, Westchester County, New York. His wife's health was failing. Grant's mother suggested moving to California. His younger brother, Jesse Root Grant, was already living in San Diego. The Grants moved into a three-story house in San Diego in 1893. Grant set up a law practice, then gave it up to invest in real estate. He purchased property throughout San Diego. In 1895, he bought the Horton House hotel. He wanted to run the hotel and name it after his father. In 1905, he razed the old hotel and built a new one, the U.S. Grant Hotel, in 1910. San Diego voters helped finance $700,000 for the $1.5 million needed to construct the hotel after Grant lacked the funds to do so. During his time in San Diego, Grant became a close associate of Charles T. Hinde, E.S. Babcock, and John D. Spreckels. Hinde and Grant served on the boards of directors of multiple banks and invested in many companies and business ventures together. Grant continued to speculate in real estate. He also became a leading citizen, who pushed for the creation of a city park, that would become Balboa Park. Grant was a delegate-at-large for California at the Republican National Conventions in 1896 and 1900. He was also an elector for California in the 1904 and 1908 presidential elections (see U.S. Electoral College). Personal life Ulysses S. Grant Junior's children depicted in an 1895 newspaper. In 1880, Grant married Fannie Josephine Chaffee (1857‚Äì1909), daughter of Jerome B. Chaffee, U.S. Senator from Colorado. They had five children: Miriam (born 1881), Chaffee (born 1883), Julia (born 1885), Fannie (born 1889), and Ulysses IV (born 1893).Note: Ulysses III (born 1881) was the son of Frederick Dent Grant. Grant's wife died in 1909 and four years later he married a widow, America Workman Will (1878‚Äì1942). Grant and America traveled extensively. In his later years, they stayed closer to home and traveled in California. He was a member of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War. Grant died at age 77 at the Sandberg Lodge on the Ridge Route north of Los Angeles while on a road trip.\\"Son of Soldier and Statesman Expires,\\" Los Angeles Times, September 27, page A-1.

According to NPR, a drop is the \\"...moment in a dance track when tension is released and the beat kicks in..., releasing the enormous energy accrued during a song's progression...after the momentum build, the pitch rising, the tension mounting, bigger, louder, until suddenly ‚Äî the drop.\\" Billboard magazine defines a drop as the \\"...moment of instrumental build[-up] when the bass and rhythm hit hardest. It's why arenas full of people suddenly start jumping up and down.\\" Related terms, typically describing certain types of drops, include a \\"beat-up\\" (so-named because it is a point where the volume of the foundational kick drum (bass drum) beat is increased, after it has been faded down during a break or buildup) and \\"climax\\" (a single, particularly striking drop done late in the track). History The drop \\"...grew out of '70s rock\\". A subtype of the drop, the bass drop, was used in the Miami bass subgenre of hip hop music in the 1980s. The bass drop was produced using the Roland TR-808's deep drum machine kick drum sound.Spin, February 1990, page 24 Since then, the TR-808 bass drop has been incorporated into a number of hip hop and electronic dance music genres, either produced by a TR-808 or using a sample of a TR-808 bass drop.808 (documentary film) The use of \\"drops\\" \\"...developed in the 2010s through the EDM festival anthem: simply called \\"the drop.\\" TypesElectronic dance music= Many genres of EDM can have more than one drop during a track, especially if the song is built on a \\"dance-pop\\" verse/chorus with vocals; a drop of some kind is typically heard somewhere during each chorus as the high point of that verse/chorus cycle. Most genres, however, tend to emphasize a single drop as the beginning of the high point, or climax, of the entire track; in vocal subgenres this is typically the last repetition of the chorus, while in nonvocal genres it typically occurs in the last quarter of the track. * In trance, eurodance, hardstyle, hardcore, house and other dance genres where the focus and emphasis is more on melodies and chord progressions, it is known as a climax. This is where the main melody and accompanying melodies come in with the drums and usually a syncopated bassline, giving the track a 'bouncy' feel. * In dubstep, the drop involves a heavy full bass line and commonly a \\"wobble\\" or \\"vowel\\" bass accompanied by a strong shuffling beat. In other dubstep styles there can be powerful chords and/or emotional melodies combined with varies of common dubstep bass lines. * Electronic music DJs sometimes perform what is called a \\"double drop\\": beatmatching two tracks in such a way that the drop, and hence the respective climaxes of both tracks, occur at the same time. =Hip hop= In hip hop and other forms of electronic music, a reintroduction of the full bass line and drums after pulling them back for a verse or buildup is known as a drop. There are usually more than one in songs from these genres; the first drop and the climax are particularly emphasized. =Metalcore= In metalcore subgenres, bass drops are often utilized under the first chord of a breakdown, to emphasize the breakdown and give it a pronounced presence. A bass drop in this genre may be done using electronic drums with a sample pad triggered by the drummer or a backing track, either of which is sent to a venue's PA system. =Rock and pop= * In rock music, the drop is characterized by an increase in the speed or activity of the bassline and usually a big boost to volume in the keyboard or guitar, and/or adding distortion or overdrive to the rhythm guitar. The song's volume and tempo change. An example of this is in Dire Strait's, \\"Money for Nothing\\". The volume and rhythm gradually rises until the beat \\"Drops\\" and the guitar solo begins. *In pop music, Billboard magazine states that in 2016, the \\"pop-drop\\" is the \\"...post-chorus musical interlude that blends techniques from electronic dance music to hip-hop, and it's taken the chorus' place in pop music. The pop-drop is the new climax of the song, right where we would expect to hear the chorus, and it is absolutely everywhere...It's set up by what's known as the \\"pre-chorus,\\" which typically cues a sing-along refrain. Then where we expect the chorus, we get yet another section of build, a kind of pseudo-chorus that further heightens expectations. Finally, the pop-drop lands. The singer literally drops out, replaced by synthesizers and chopped-up, distorted vocal samples that vaguely reference the earlier lyrics\\", over a syncopated beat.

Description The laws are two amendments (Chap. 457, Laws 1926, sections 1941 & 1943) to the Laws of New York. Written by and named after Senator Caleb H. Baumes, the chairman of the New York State Crime Commission, the sections called for the automatic life imprisonment of any criminal convicted of more than three separate felonies, without regard to the nature of the offense or any attendant circumstances. It also permitted longer sentences for first-time offenders, denied parole to inmates who had used firearms in the commission of their crimes, and mandated that prisoners could not begin receiving credit for good behavior for parole purposes until they had served the minimum sentence for their offense. By 1930, twenty-three states had adopted similar standards, all of which were commonly referred to as \\"Baumes laws\\".Cole, Simon A. (2002). \\"Suspect Identities: A History of Fingerprinting and Criminal Identification\\". Harvard University Press, pp. 217-18. The law was made possible by the growing adoption and acceptance of fingerprinting as a method of identification by police departments, which began to replace anthropometry as the technique of choice in the 1920s. Law enforcement officials felt that the new methods enabled them to more efficiently and reliably distinguish recalcitrant criminals from reformed ones. By 1931, two hundred four-time offenders in New York had been given life sentences under the Baumes law. Legal challenges A serious challenge to the Baumes law concerned the case of a shoplifter named Ruth St. Clair, who was arrested for the fourth time after stealing items from a department store in December 1929. St. Clair had three prior convictions of a similar nature in 1920, 1924, and 1926, for stealing items such as coats and dresses from stores. When she was convicted of the 1929 offense, the Baumes law imposed a life sentence, the first given to a woman since its enactment. St. Clair's case attracted much media attention, but the United States Supreme Court upheld her sentence in 1930. St. Clair eventually spent eight years in prison, before her sentence was commuted to time served.Segrave, Kerry (2001). \\"Shoplifting: A Social History\\". McFarland and Company, p. 35. Effects of the Baumes law While the Baumes law seemed to remove authority from judges and parole boards by mandating sentences, they gradually began to work around it through the increased use of plea bargains. In cases where a life sentence would have been unjust, prosecutors became more amenable to accused parties' guilty pleas to misdemeanor charges, which would not trigger portions of the statute.Remington, Frank J. (1993). The Decision to Charge, the Decision to Convict on a Plea of Guilty, and the Impact of Sentence Structure on Prosecution Practices. In Lloyd E. Ohlin and Frank J. Remington (Eds.) \\"Discretion in Criminal Justice\\". SUNY Press, p. 84. . The Baumes law increased prison populations as persons who would formerly have been paroled remained incarcerated, placing a strain on infrastructure. In addition to a negative effect on prison conditions, the Baumes law also decreased prisoner morale, since it greatly decreased inmates' ability to achieve parole. Commenting on the Baumes law in his autobiography, Clarence Darrow wrote, > The unfortunates in prisons felt that there was no chance for regaining > liberty once the prison doors closed upon them. This hopelessness kindled > prison revolts, which led to fearful slaughter, to the destruction of all > that the years of earnest work had done to modify conditions by building up > humane prisons, caring for juvenile offenders, and giving the condemned hope > or opportunity once more to be free.Darrow, Clarence S. (1996).\\"The Story of > My Life\\". Da Capo Press, p. 336. The Baumes law led to 1929 riots at Auburn and Dannemora, with nine prisoners and a guard losing their lives during the former. In response to the riots, New York appointed a committee to investigate the state's prison system. Led by Sam Lewisohn, who would ultimately become the president of the American Prison Association, the Lewisohn Commission issued a number of recommended changes, the majority of which became policy. Among these was a shift from the mandatory sentences of the Baumes law to a more open-ended sentencing and parole system, focused on rehabilitation and vocational training.Rollins, Jr., Alfred B. (2001). \\"Roosevelt and Howe\\". Transaction Publishers, p. 306. \\"Bum's rush\\" Some people mistakenly believe that a corrupted version of \\"Baumes law\\" was the origin for the idiom \\"bum's rush\\". However, this phrase was in common use before the passage of the Baumes law,Ammer, Christine (1997). \\"The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms.

Dashiell Hammett's 1929 novel The Maltese Falcon (novel) has a bit of dialogue referring to \\"Baumes rush\\" in reference to a hoodlum who'd left New York for San Francisco, the implication being he had been chased out by the law, so perhaps the \\"Baumes\\" variant was back-fit to the existing one given the assonance of the name.

Wolfram may have been referring to the northern French poet Guiot de Provins, but this identification has proven unsatisfactory. The consensus of the vast majority of scholars today is that Kyot was an invention by Wolfram, and that Wolfram's true sources were Chr√©tien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail and his own abundant creativity. Wolfram does not mention Kyot until Book 8 of Parzival, where he abruptly names him as his source. Kyot's story is elaborated upon in Book 9, where Wolfram explains the Proven√ßal had uncovered a neglected Arabic manuscript in Moorish Toledo, Spain. The manuscript was written by Flegetanis, a Muslim astronomer and a descendant of Solomon who had found the secrets of the Holy Grail written in the stars. After learning Arabic to read Flegetanis' document, Kyot traveled throughout Europe to learn more about the Grail and the brotherhood that protected it. He finally came to Anjou, where he found the history of Parzival (Percival)'s family and wrote the tale which would later be retold by Wolfram. Wolfram explains he had not revealed Kyot earlier because the Proven√ßal had asked to remain anonymous until the right point in the story. Wolfram mentions doubters who had questioned him about his source, and says their skepticism only brought them shame once Kyot was revealed. Some scholars have taken this to mean that Wolfram had faced criticism for his story's departures from Chr√©tien de Troyes, and had created a pseudo-source with a back story that would silence and mock slow-witted critics while amusing those who saw through it. Formerly, some scholars who believe Kyot was real identified him with Guiot de Provins. The names Kyot and Guiot are cognate, but the historical poet was not from the southern French region of Provence, but the northern town of Provins, and none of Guiot's surviving works deal with the Holy Grail or suggest any thematic relation with Parzival. Some aspects of Parzival may hint at a source besides Wolfram's imagination and Chr√©tien, such as an implied knowledge of French literature and a reverence for the House of Anjou, but none of these obstacles are better explained as deriving from an authentic Kyot than from an extraordinary mind with broad interests. Kyot appears as a companion of the titular protagonist in Umberto Eco's novel Baudolino, where he argues with Robert de Boron over the nature of the Grail. The character in the novel is a conflation of Kyot the Proven√ßal with Guiot, being from Champagne. References *Wolfram von Eschenbach, A.T. Hatto (translator), Parzival.

It covers issues as diverse as mother-daughter relationships, lesbianism, racism, clinical depression, poverty, education, and the struggle between medicine based on \\"scientific fact\\" and that based on \\"native superstitious know-how\\". Plot summary Annie John, the protagonist of the book, starts out as a young girl who worships her mother. She follows her everywhere, and is shocked and hurt when she learns that she must some day live in a different house from her mother. While her mother tries to teach her to become a lady, Annie is sent to a new school where she must prove herself intellectually and make new friends. She then falls in love with a girl by the name of Gwen. She promises Gwen that she will always love her. However, Annie later finds herself admiring and adoring a girl that she called the \\"Red Girl\\". She admires this girl in all aspects of her life. To Annie this girl is the meaning of freedom because she does not have to do any daily hygienic routines like the other girls. Annie John is then moved to a higher class because of her intelligence. For this reason, Annie is drawn away from her best friend Gwen, while alienating herself from her mother and the other adults in her life. It later becomes clear that she also suffers from some kind of mental depression, which distances her from both her family and her friends. The book ends with her physically distancing herself away from all that she knows and loves by leaving home for nursing school in England. Publication history The book's chapters were originally published separately in The New Yorker, before being combined and published as the novel Annie John, the stories connected by Kincaid's use of Annie John as the narrator. Major themes, symbolism, and style Children growing apart from their parents while becoming adolescents is the major theme in the novel. Annie and her mother share common personalities, goals and even look exactly alike, though they grow apart through the narrative. Barbara Wiedemann writes that Kincaid's fiction is not specifically aimed at a young adult audience, but the readers will benefit from insight evident in Kincaid's description of coming of age.Weidemann, Barabra. \\"Work Analysis.\\" Masterplots II: Juvenile& Young Adult Literature Series Supplement 12.4 (1997): 1-2. Print. Annie John has been noted to contain feminist views.Smith, Pamela J. Olubunmi. \\"Work Analysis.\\" Masterplots II: Women's Literature Series 12.4 (1995): 1-3. Print. Asked if the relationship between Annie and Gwen was meant to suggest ‚Äúlesbian tendencies,‚Äù Kincaid replied: \\"No‚Ä¶I think I am always surprised that people interpret it so literally.\\" The relationship between Gwen and Annie is really a practicing relationship. It's about how things work. It's like learning to walk. Always there is the sense that they would go on to lead heterosexual lives. Whatever happened between them, homosexuality would not be a serious thing because it is just practicing‚Äù (Vorda 94). In the story, the theme of colonization is conveyed. England has colonized Antigua, and has reconstructed its society. This is seen when the reader is introduced to Miss George and Miss Edward, teachers at Annie's school, who are both named after English kings. Antigua in return, strongly dislikes England for disposing of its native culture. Water is consistently used throughout the novel to depict the separation between Annie John and her mother. Symbolic references to water (including the sea, rain, and other forms) illustrate Annie's development from childhood to maturity. Near the start of the novel, the reader learns that Annie has both a normal baby bottle and one shaped like a boat - and that is only the beginning of her water-connected choices in life. Kincaid's writing form is not in the traditional paragraph form, but run-on sentences and paragraphs with little fragments. Jan Hall, a writer for Salem Press Master Plots, Fourth Edition book states in an article about Annie John that ‚Äúbecause the novel has no years, months, or dates the story has a sense of timelessness.‚Äù Connections to other works There are clear echoes to themes and events from Kincaid's books Lucy and My Brother. My Brother is a non- fiction story, yet Annie John has some of the same events and facts placed in her own family as if Annie was Kincaid when she was younger. In My Brother, Kincaid's father had to walk after he ate because he had a bad digestive tract and heart, their family ate fish, bread, and butter, a six-year-old died in her mother's arm going over the same bridge that her father had recently walked on after eating, and the character of Miss Charlotte dies in both books. Lucy can be cited as a continuation of Annie John being that Annie John has moved off of her Caribbean island of Antigua and is starting a new life in England, even though Lucy is in America, because hypothetically Annie John will have to learn how to adjust to England. Jan Hall writes: ‚Äúthe themes of Annie John, Jamaica Kincaid‚Äôs first novel, are continued in Lucy (1990), a novel about a young woman‚Äôs experiences after leaving her Caribbean island.‚ÄùHall, Jan. \\"Work Analysis.\\" Masterplots, Fourth Edition 12.4 (2010): Print.

He was a cousin of Will Longstaff, also a painter, as well as a war artist. Biography Longstaff was born at Clunes, Victoria, second son of Ralph Longstaff, storekeeper and Janet (Jessie) Campbell. John was educated at a boarding school in Miners Rest and Clunes State School. He later studied at the Melbourne National Gallery School, after his father initially disapproved of his artistic ambitions. Longstaff's talent was recognised by George Folingsby. He married Rosa Louisa (Topsy) Crocker on 20 July 1887 Powlett Street, East Melbourne. He won the National Gallery of Victoria's first travelling scholarship for his 1887 narrative painting Breaking the News (which inspired a 1912 film of the same name), and John and his wife sailed from Melbourne for London in September 1887. In January 1888 they travelled to Paris, where John exhibited in the Paris Salon. He later moved to London, where he painted many portraits. He returned to Australia in 1894 and was given several commissions. He occupied a studio at Grosvenor Chambers in Melbourne from 1897 to 1900. The National Gallery of Victoria assumed ownership of The Sirens under terms of the scholarship and bought his large landscape Gippsland, Sunday night, 20 February 1898. He travelled to London again in 1901, where he exhibited with the Royal Academy. Longstaff was appointed an official war artist with the Australian Infantry Force in the First World War. He made several portraits of officers in the military. On his return to Australia he won several awards and was given distinguished positions, such as his appointment to President of the Victorian Artists Society in 1924 and Trustee of the National Gallery of Victoria in 1927. He was knighted in 1928, the first Australian artist to have had this honour. In 1924, Longstaff met Miss Jessica Harcourt, at the time a theatre programme seller, and later actress, in Sydney and later called \\"Australia's loveliest girl\\". He was struck by her beauty and painted her twice. In 1925 he exhibited Harcourt's portrait with Twenty Melbourne Painters at the Athenaeum Hall. Longstaff was happy with his subject, regarding Harcourt as \\"almost a perfect type of feminine beauty\\", and it was considered \\"one of the best things he had ever done.\\" His 1929 portrait of the artist Ellis Rowan was the first national portrait of an Australian woman.Sydney Morning Herald 6 December 1929 The Art Gallery of South Australia holds his portraits of Paris Nesbit and The Artist's Wife. Longstaff's portraits of women were the subject of the 2012 exhibition Portrait of a Lady at the Shepparton Art Museum. Biography His biography Portrait in Youth, written by Nina Murdoch was published in 1948. His 1920 portrait of Nina Murdoch hangs in Reading Room of the National Library, Canberra.http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100611b.htm Archibald prize His Archibald Prize winning pieces: *1925 - Portrait of Maurice Moscovitch *1928 - Portrait of Dr Alexander Leeper *1929 - W A Holman, KC *1931 - Sir John Sulman *1935 - A B ('Banjo') Paterson Gallery Image:John Longstaff - Breaking the News, 1887.jpgBreaking the News, 1887, Art Gallery of Western Australia Image:John Longstaff The Young Mother.jpgThe Young Mother, 1891, National Gallery of Victoria Image:Gippsland, Sunday night, February 20th, 1898.jpgGippsland, Sunday night, February 20th, 1898, 1898, National Gallery of Victoria Image:John Longstaff - Arrival of Burke, Wills and King, 1861.jpgArrival of Burke, Wills and King at the deserted camp at Cooper's Creek, Sunday evening, 21 April 1861, 1907, National Gallery of Victoria References *Leigh Astbury, 'Longstaff, Sir John Campbell (1861‚Äì1941)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 10, MUP, 1986, pp 141‚Äì142.

The battle saw the defeat and overthrow of Alexander Balas from the Seleucid throne by Ptolemy VI of Egypt. Prelude Alexander Balas became a rival king of the Seleucid Empire from the city of Ptolemais in 152 BC. He secured the aid of the Judeans by appointing Jonathan Maccabaeus as high priest. Allied with the Judeans, he succeeded in killing Demetrius I Soter and claimed the Seleucid throne for himself. Alexander Balas initially had the support of Ptolemy VI and was married to Ptolemy's daughter Cleopatra Thea to create an alliance. After obtaining the throne, Alexander abandoned himself to a life of debauchery, losing the support of his subjects and Ptolemy, leading to the latter's invasion of Syria in 145 BC. Demetrius I's son Demetrius II profited from this and used the opportunity to reclaim the throne and joined forces with Ptolemy against Alexander. Battle and Aftermath Ptolemy invaded Syria and succeeded in getting the people of Antioch to support Demetrius II, meanwhile, Balas left Cilicia and entered Syria, pillaging the country around Antioch. The army of Ptolemy and Demetrius clashed with Alexander's by the Oenoparus river near Antioch in a pitched battle. The Ptolemaic army prevailed forcing Balas to flee, though Ptolemy suffered a mortal wound when his horse fell on him, having been frightened by the noise of an elephant. He however, did not perish in the immediate battle, as he was protected by his guards and sent to Egypt where he could not understand or speak for days. Balas fled to Nabataea for refuge, but was murdered by a Nabataean prince named Zabdiel, who cut off his head seeking favor from his enemies. His head was delivered to the mortally wounded Ptolemy, who died shortly afterwards.

It spans 40 acres, and was in danger of demolition before Doris Duke, through the Newport Restoration Foundation bought it in 1973 and began restoration of the historical site. Notable features of it include an operational windmill (c. 1812), British General Prescott's Guard House, a county store (c. 1715), and a University of Rhode Island Master Gardener project with the purpose of simulating a historical vegetable garden through careful research on what crops where grown during that time period. The farm itself is typical of the farms on Aquidneck Island. History The farm was founded in the 18th century. According to some sources, it was originally named Overing and Page Farm in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, founded by the brothers Thomas Nichols and Edmund Nichols in 1650. However, it seems that the two brothers moved to Newport in 1654, so it is not clear whether or not the two farms are the same. British General Richard Prescott occupied the farm prior to the Battle of Rhode Island. He was kidnapped from the farm on July 9, 1777 by a small contingent of colonists and taken to Providence. Prescott was later exchanged for U.S. General Charles Lee. In 1973, Doris Duke's Newport Restoration Foundation purchased the land and opened it to the public. In 2007, the University of Rhode Island Master Gardeners began their project. Current status While most of the farm is open to the public, certain properties are privately rented out and thus not accessible to the public. These include the Overing House and the Potter House (c. 1970). Prescott Farm's current attractions include showcased buildings, a pond, and several walking paths. The garden currently donates all of its produce to Lucy‚Äôs Hearth, a nearby women‚Äôs shelter.

Plates in the 2GAT series would have been issued in mid-1987. At that time, California was issuing license plates on the \\"Golden State\\" base rather than the current \\"Script\\" base. \\"Golden State\\" California license plates were available as alternate option to the previous yellow-on-blue since 1982. It was issued from 2AAA000 to 2GPZ999. Another commonly used fictional California license plate, 2FAN321, also would have been issued on a \\"Golden State\\" base in 1987. GAT, like SAM and FAN, is a three-letter combination not used by the California Department of Motor Vehicles. In addition, the California Department of Motor Vehicles does not use the letter \\"I\\", \\"O\\", or \\"Q\\" in the first or third position of the three- letter combination. However, prop California license plates seen in television shows and movies frequently do. Prop California license plates are frequently reused on vehicles in different television show and movies. They are sometimes reused on different vehicles in different episodes of the same television series. Most prop license plates are in the 2, 3, and 4-series, but they are often used on new vehicles that would be issued a 5 or 6 series license number.

The post appeared under the Umayyad Caliphate, but gained in influence and prestige in the more settled court of the Abbasids, under whom it ranked as one of the senior offices of the state, alongside the vizier. From the Caliphates, the post spread to other areas under Muslim dominion: in al-Andalus the hajib was always superior to the vizier and by the 10th century had come to wield enormous power; in the eastern dynasties, the Samanids, Buyids and Ghaznavids, the title acquired a mainly military role; under the Seljuks, Ilkhanids and Timurids it reverted to its role as a court official; in Fatimid Egypt, the chief hajib, styled Sahib al-bab (\\"Master of the Gate\\") or hajib al-hujjab (\\"chamberlain of chamberlains, head chamberlain\\") was also an important official; under the Mamluks, they acquired important judicial duties. Origin The office has its origins in pre-Islamic Arabia, where doorkeeping (·∏•ijƒÅba, \\"concealing\\") was one of the duties of domestic slaves or clients (mawƒÅlƒ´, singular mawlƒÅ) of an Arab household. Modern scholars have traditionally regarded the office of hajib in a courtly setting as an innovation of the Umayyad Caliphate (661‚Äì750), but in reality it is widely attested in the sources for the pre-Islamic Ghassanid and Lakhmid kings, the prophet Muhammad, Sajah, various early Muslim provincial governors and political figures, including all early caliphs and anti-caliphs such as Hasan ibn Ali and Ibn al-Zubayr. However, in Arabic historiography, their existence is often obscured or euphemistically paraphrased, since the office was ill regarded in early Muslim society, with its strong egalitarian tendencies. Indeed, the formalization of the hajib is part of the consolidation and stratification process of the Muslim society after the early Muslim conquests, when the ruler began to be separated from the ruled, and surrounded by an increasingly elaborate ceremonial, borrowed in large part from Sassanid Persian practic. Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates In the Umayyad and early Abbasid periods, up to the early 9th century, most of the occupants of the office were still mawƒÅlƒ´. During this time, the hajib still occupied a lower rung in the court hierarchy than the Arab aristocracy or the great ministers of state. His main duties were those of a master of ceremonies, organizing and supervising caliphal audiences, and bringing visitors to the caliph's presence. He was also head of the palace staff, and might sometimes be employed by the caliph as a trusted agent in eliminating certain of the caliph's subjects. With the rise of the Abbasids, the mawƒÅlƒ´ gained in prestige at court, despite their often very humble origin. With the introduction of the vizier as the head of government, a kind of separation of powers emerged, where the vizier‚Äîusually drawn from the secretarial class‚Äîheaded the administration, while the hajib controlled courtly affairs. The holders of the two offices often vied for control of the administration; thus the hajibs al-Rabi' ibn Yunus and his son al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi' both became viziers after the dismissal of their rivals who previously held the office. This division and the rivalry between the two offices was strengthened during the \\"Samarra period\\", when the office of hajib began to be occupied by Turkish slave soldiers (ghilman, sing. ghulam), whose \\"background, formation, and interests differed starkly from those of the bureaucratic vizier\\". Under Caliph al-Mutawakkil, the Turkish hijab Itakh served as chief minister, since the Caliph did not nominate a vizier. In the late 9th century, the position of the vizier was strengthened, as the powers of the office became more formalized and he emerged as the head of the civilian administration, underpinned by a highly specialized secretarial class. Another contender for authority also emerged in the commander-in-chief of the army. However, the hajib remained a powerful official, especially during palace coups, as he controlled a part of the caliphal bodyguard, notably the Ma·π£ƒÅffiyya. Under al- Muqtadir (), the hajib Nasr al-Kushuri became a major power-broker, since he occupied his post continuously from 908‚Äì929, whereas the viziers changed rapidly during this period. He not only had a role in the selection of several viziers, but also was responsible for arresting them when they were dismissed. After 929, the commanders-in-chief supplanted the viziers in power and began dominating the government, becoming the main rivals of the hajib, who now also assumed a more military character. Thus the hajib Yaqut had his son Muhammad ibn Yaqut appointed sahib al-shurta in his rivalry with the commander-in-chief Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, before they were both dismissed at the latter's insistence. Under al-Qahir () the hajib Ibn Yalbaq was a soldier who tried to impose his pro-Shi'a beliefs on the caliph. Under ar-Radi, Muhammad ibn Yaqut made a comeback, combining the positions of hajib and commander-in-chief, but despite their dominant position in Baghdad, the lack of financial resources meant that the hajib could not compete with provincial governors who controlled the sources of revenue. Thus in 936 it was Ibn Ra'iq who was selected as amir al-umara, and became the de facto ruler of the caliphate. Having lost the struggle for power, the chamberlains were recompensed with an increase in titelature: from 941, the head chamberlain was known as hajib al- hujab (\\"chamberlain of chamberlains\\"). Al-Andalus In the Umayyad Emirate of Cordoba and in the succeeding Caliphate of Cordoba, the hajib was from the outset the most senior minister of the state, at the head of his own court (majlis), where he received petitioners and messengers. The hajib was the chief aide of the emir or caliph and the head of the administration, supervising the three main branches into which it was divided: the royal household, the chancery, and the financial department. Several of the holders of the office also commanded armies. Unlike the Islamic East, the title of vizier was given to lower-ranking counsellors tasked with various matters, and subordinate to the hajib; the latter was almost always chosen from the viziers. A number of ordinary hajibs was tasked with the doorkeeping duties and directing court ceremonies. Notable hajibs were Abd al-Karim ibn Abd al- Wahid ibn Mughith, who served in the post in the successive reigns of Hisham I (), al-Hakam I (), and Abd al-Rahman II (); the famously incorruptible Isa ibn Shuhayd, who served under Abd al-Rahman II and into the reign of Muhammad I (); and finally Almanzor, who as the hajib assumed quasi-regal authority and was the de facto ruler of the Caliphate of Cordoba 978 until hid death in 1002. Following the collapse of the caliphate and the political fragmentation of al-Andalus into the competing taifa kingdoms, some of the taifa rulers, who were not members of the Umayyad dynasty and could not claim the title of caliph, imitated Almanzor and used the title of hajib, rather than malik (\\"king\\"), thus maintaining the fiction that they were simply representatives of the long-vanished caliph. Eastern Islamic dynasties Many of the dynasties that emerged in the eastern Islamic world after the fragmentation of the Abbasid Caliphate in the 9th‚Äì10th centuries modelled their administrative and courtly practices on the Abbasids. Thus the title of hajib was still used for masters of ceremonies and intermediaries between the ruler to the bureaucracy, but also as a military rank given to generals and provincial governors. Thus in the Samanid dynasty (819‚Äì999), which also relied on a Turkic-dominated ghilman corps, the title was originally restricted to the ruler's household, but by the mid-10th century had come to acquire a military role: the \\"chief\\" or \\"great hajib\\" (al-hajib al-kabir, hajib al-hudjjab, hajib-i buzurg) was the second man in the state, combining in his person the functions of head of the palace and commander-in-chief. Ordinary hajibs served as generals and, occasionally, provincial governors. According to Nizam al- Mulk's account on the training of ghilman, a ghulam could rise through the ranks to withaq-bashi (\\"tent leader\\"), khayl-bashi (\\"detachment commander\\"), before attaining the rank of hijab, and then become amir of a province. The Samanid practice was emulated by the successor Ghaznavid dynasty (977‚Äì1186) as well, with the hajib-i buzurg as the commander-in-chief in the Sultan's stead, commanding several ordinary hajibs as generals; all of them were distinguished by a black cloak, a specific type of belt, and a two-pointed cap. However, unlike the Samanids, the Ghaznavid hajib-i buzurg did not exercise direct control over the palace administration, which was in the hands of the wakil-i khass, nor over the palace guard, which was entrusted to the salar-i ghulaman-i saray. In the Buyid emirates (934‚Äì1062), which lacked the sophisticated central government of the Abbasid type, hajib was exclusively a military title. The account of Miskawayh implies that here too there was a succession of ranks, from naqib to qa'id and then to hajib. In the Seljuk Empire (1037‚Äì1194), however, the mainly military role of the chief hajib receded somewhat, although, given the military character of the Seljuk court, its occupant was still a Turkish commander (amir), with a staff mostly drawn from ghilman. The amir hajib might still participate in campaigns and command parts of an army, but he was once again mostly a court official, commanding generals being designated as sipahsalar or isfahsalar. The office's role under the Seljuks is described in the writings of Nizam al-Mulk and Muhammad bin Ali Rawandi. Anachronistically ascribing its existence to the practices of the Sasanian court, the latter writes that the hajib was the official responsible for administering punishment. The amir hajib was the highest-ranking court official, and apart from ceremonies and protocol, he was also responsible for military discipline. Under Muhammad I Tapar, the amir hajib is recorded as acting as the intermediary between the Seljuk sultan and his officials, including the vizier. Nizam al-Mulk also mentions the existence of a hajib-i dargah, responsible for ceremonies and order at court; it is unclear whether that was a distinct office from that of amir hajib. From the names of amir hajibs provided by Rawandi, the office was not hereditary‚Äîwith only one exception: Ali Bar, hajib of Muhammad I, was succeeded by his son Muhammad, under Mahmud II‚Äîand was often held by some of the most powerful amir of the day, while others are rather unknown. There were also a number of junior chamberlains with the simple title of hajib in the Seljuk court. In time, the most important generals and provincial governors, as well as other prominent men of the realm, also acquired hajibs in their retinues. These were not always military men. Under the Ilkhanids (1256‚Äì1357), the hajib was again a chamberlain, although both in the royal court as well as in the lesser provincial courts these men were drawn from the military class. The hajibs remained court officials under the Timurids, while under the Safavids the chief chamberlain was known as ishik-aqasi bashi and held the duties of a master of ceremonies analogous to the hajib-i dargah. Egypt and the Levant In the Fatimid Caliphate, the hajibs were chamberlains, with the chief chamberlain known as the \\"Lord of the Gate\\" (sahib al-bab) or, occasionally, as \\"Chief Chamberlain\\" (hajib al-hujjab). Furthermore, the writer Ibn al- Sayrfi mentions the existence of a hajib al-diwan, tasked with preventing unauthorized visitors and preserving state secrets. The military hajib was introduced to the Levant by the Seljuks, and this model was followed by the Zengids and the Ayyubids after them. However, the use of the title hajib for chamberlains continued in Egypt until the 13th century. MaghrebReferencesSources *D.

It is located a few kilometres away from the Turkish and Iraqi border. The population of the city at the 2010 census was 57,844. Etymology Hakkari finds it origin in the Assyrian word of \\"akkare\\" (Syriac: ‹ê‹≤‹ü‹µ‹™‹π‹ê) which translates to plowmen or farmer. Ibn Khallikan, a 13th century Islamic scholar from Erbil, wrote that Hakk√¢ri means belonging to the Kurdish tribe of Hakk√¢r, which possesses numerous fortresses, castles, and villages in the country to the east of Mosul. HistoryHubushkia= Hubushkia was an Iron Age kingdom located between the Urartian and Assyrian sphere of influence. The exact location of Hubushkia is unknown, but scholars suggests that the kingdom of Hubushkia was centred on the headwaters of the Great Zap River, in what is now Hakk√¢ri Province in Eastern Anatolia, Turkey.Veli Sevin, Mystery Stelae, Archaeology, Volume 53 Number 4, (July/August 2000). In its long history, the region has come under the rule of the Kardukh, Gutian, Kassite, Hurrian, Mitanni, Nairi, Assyrian, Urartian, Armenian, Median, and Persian civilizations.http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n;=3000-years- later-kings-of-hakkari-see-the-light-of-day-1998-10-13 =Hakkari kurgan stelae= Thirteen Kurgan stelae, never before seen in Anatolia or the Near East, were found in 1998 in their original location at the centre of Hakkari. The stelae were carved on upright flagstone-like slabs measuring between 0.7 m to 3.10 m in height. The stones contain only one cut surface, upon which human figures are chiseled. The theme of each stele reveals the foreview of an upper human body. The legs are not represented. Eleven of the stelae depict naked warriors with daggers, spears, and axes‚Äîmasculine symbols of war. They always hold a drinking vessel made of skin in both hands. Two stelae contain female figures without arms. The stelae may have been carved by different craftsmen using different techniques. Stylistic differences shift from bas relief to a more systematic linearity. The earliest stelae are in the style of bas relief while the latest ones are in a linear style. They were made during a period from the fifteenth century BC to the eleventh century BC in Hakkari. Stelae with this type of relief are not common in the ancient Near East however there are many close parallels between these and those produced by a variety of peoples from the Eurasian steppes between the third millennium BC and the eleventh century AD.Mystery Stelae. Archaeology.org. Retrieved on 2011-02-11. =Genocide= About 20,000 to 30,000 Assyrians in the area were killed by the Ottoman army and local Kurdish tribes working in tandem during the Assyrian Genocide. The majority of the Assyrian affected by the massacres were adherents of the Assyrian Church of the East (often dubbed incorrectly Nestorian), who have originally inhabited the mountainous Hakkari and Barwari regions covering parts of the modern provinces of the Hakk√¢ri, ≈ûƒ±rnak and Van in Turkey and Dohuk in Iraq, with a population ranging between 75,000 and 150,000. Most of these Assyrians were massacred during the Genocide of 1915. The rest endured two winter marches to Urmia in 1915 and to Hamadan in 1918. Many of them were relocated to refugee camps by the British in Baquba and later to Habbaniyah, and in 1921 some were enlisted in the pro-British Assyrian Levies which helped quell Kurdish revolts in the British Mandate of Mesopotamia. Most Hakkari Assyrians were resettled after 1925 in a cluster of villages in northern Iraq.

He was also known for his carefully composed abstract still life images. Early life and career Born in Manhattan, Newman grew up in Atlantic City, New Jersey and later moved to Miami Beach, Florida. In 1936, he studied painting and drawing at the University of Miami. Unable to afford to continue after two years, he moved to Philadelphia to work for a studio, making 49-cent portraits in 1938. Newman returned to Florida in 1942 to manage a portrait studio in West Palm Beach. Three years later, he opened his own business in Miami Beach. In 1946, Newman relocated to New York, opened Arnold Newman Studios and worked as a freelance photographer for Fortune, Life, and Newsweek. Though never a member, Newman frequented the Photo League during the 1940s.Arnold Newman bio at The Jewish Museum Success as a photographer Newman found his vision in the empathy he felt for artists and their work. Although he photographed many personalities‚ÄîMarlene Dietrich, John F. Kennedy, Harry S. Truman, Piet Mondrian, Pablo Picasso, Arthur Miller, Marilyn Monroe, Ronald Reagan, Mickey Mantle, and Audrey Hepburn‚Äîhe maintained that even if the subject is not known, or is already forgotten, the photograph itself must still excite and interest the viewer. Newman is often credited with being the photographer who articulated and who consistently employed the genre of environmental portraiture, in which the photographer uses a carefully framed and lit setting, and its contents, to symbolise the individual's life and work; a well known example being his portrait of Igor Stravinsky in which the lid of his grand piano forms a gargantuan musical note representative of the melodic structure of the composer's work. Newman normally captured his subjects in their most familiar surroundings with representative visual elements showing their professions and personalities. A musician for instance might be photographed in their recording studio or on stage, a Senator or other politician in their office or a representative building. Using a large- format camera and tripod, he worked to record every detail of a scene. Igor Stravinsky by Newman photographed at the Louisiana Art Museum, Humlebaek, Denmark \\"I didn't just want to make a photograph with some things in the background,\\" Newman told American Photo magazine in an interview. \\"The surroundings had to add to the composition and the understanding of the person. No matter who the subject was, it had to be an interesting photograph. Just to simply do a portrait of a famous person doesn't mean a thing.\\" Newman's best-known images were in black and white, although he often photographed in color. His 1946 black and white portrait of Stravinsky seated at a grand piano became his signature image, even though it was rejected by Harper's Bazaar, the magazine that gave the assignment to Newman. He was one of the few photographers allowed to make a portrait of the famously camera-shy Henri Cartier-Bresson. Among Newman's best-known color images is an eerie portrait from 1963 that shows former Nazi industrialist and minister of armament Alfried Krupp in one of Krupp's factories. Newman admits his personal feelings influenced his portrayal of Krupp. Newman taught photography at Cooper Union for many years. On December 19, 2005, Newman made his last formal portrait of director James (Jimmy) Burrows at the NBC studio on the Saturday Night Live stage. This session was particularly special for Newman because he had photographed Jimmy's father Abe Burrows several times. He was recovering from a stroke when he died at Mt. Sinai Medical Center, New York on June 6, 2006.Death of Arnold Newman reported by MSNBC Bibliography    * * Awards *1985: Missouri Honor Medal for Distinguished Service in Journalism, Missouri School of Journalism, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO *1999 Infinity Award for Master of Photography, International Center of Photography, ManhattanNewman's biography at the ICP website for his 1999 Infinity Award *2004 Lucie Award for Outstanding Achievement in Portrait Photography, International Photography Awards program, Los Angeles, California2004 Lucie Award information * 2004 He was awarded The Royal Photographic Society's Centenary Medal and Honorary Fellowship (HonFRPS) in recognition of a sustained, significant contribution to the art of photography.

Prior to the siege, the Crusader Principality was oblivious to the loss of the city, as demonstrated when Baibars sent negotiators to the leader of the former Crusader state and mocked his use of \\"Prince\\" in the title Prince of Antioch.  Prelude to the Siege  In 1260 Baibars, the Sultan of Egypt and Syria, began to threaten the Principality of Antioch, a Crusader state, which (as a vassal of the Armenians) had supported the Mongols, the traditional enemies of the Turks. In 1265, Baibars took Caesarea, Haifa and Arsuf A year later, Baibars conquered Galilee and devastated Cilician Armenia. As Steven Runciman relates in his last book about the Crusades, decades before the siege of Antioch (1268), prince Bohemond IV of Antioch had settled his court in the city of Tripoli, capital of his other state, the County of Tripoli. In 1268, the Antiochene knights and garrison were under the command of , Constable of Antioch, whose wife was an Armenian Lady who was relative to Sibylla of Armenia, wife of prince Bohemond VI.  Siege of Antioch  In 1268 Baibars besieged the city of Antioch, which was \\"badly defended by its patriarch and abandoned by most of its inhabitants,\\"Joseph Michaud, History of the Crusades, Wm. Robson, trans. 3 vols. (London: Routledge, 1881), Vol. 3, p. 17. capturing it on 18 May (the citadel fell two days later) after a relatively feeble defense.Michaud, History of the Crusades, vol. 3, pp. 17-18; Jean Richard and Jean Birrell, The Crusades, c. 1071-c. 1291 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 419. Antioch had been weakened by its previous struggles with Armenia and by internal power struggles, and its inhabitants were quick to agree to a surrender, on the condition that the lives of the citizens within the walls would be spared. Before Baibars' forces laid siege on Antioch, the Constable Simon Mansel, along with a group of knights, led an unsuccessful attack against the Muslim army in order that the city should not be encircled. The defenses were in good condition, but the garrison was unable to defend the long walls of the city. Mansel was captured during the Antiochene cavalry attack, and Baibars ordered him to command his lieutenants in Antioch to surrender immediately. The garrison refused to capitulate, and continued the defense of the walls. Afterwards, lamenting that Antioch's ruler had not been present either for the siege or for the ransacking and murder, Baibars' secretary (who was also his biographer) wrote a detailed letter describing exactly what had been done to the people and the city:The letter is excerpted in Francesco Gabrieli, Arab Historians of the Crusades (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1984), 310; Richard and Birrell, The Crusades, 419; Michaud, The History of the Crusades, vol. 3, p. 18. > 'Death came among the besieged from all sides and by all roads: we killed > all that thou hadst appointed to guard the city or defend its approaches. If > thou hadst seen thy knights trampled under the feet of the horses, thy > provinces given up to pillage, thy riches distributed by measures full, the > wives of thy subjects put to public sale; if thou hadst seen the pulpits and > crosses overturned, the leaves of the Gospel torn and cast to the winds, and > the sepulchres of thy patriarchs profaned; if thou hadst seen thy enemies, > the Mussulmans trampling upon the tabernacle, and immolating in the > sanctuary, monk, priest and deacon; in short, if thou hadst seen thy palaces > given up to the flames, the dead devoured by the fire of this world, the > Church of St Paul and that of St Peter completely and entirely destroyed, > certes, thou wouldst have cried out \\"Would to Heaven that I were become > dust!\\" '. (Michaud, 1853) Michaud after quoting the letter of Baibar's concludes the sacking thus: > 'Baibars distributed the booty among his soldiers, the Mamelukes reserving > as their portion the women girls and children [...] A little boy was worth > twelve dirhems, a little girl five dirhems. In a single day the city of > Antioch lost all its inhabitants and a conflagration lighted by order of > Bibars completed the work of the barbarians. Most historians agree in saying > that fourteen thousand Christians were slaughtered and a hundred thousand > dragged away into slavery.' Historian Thomas Madden concludes that the events and destruction following the Siege of Antioch, \\"was the single greatest massacre of the entire crusading era.\\"Thomas F. Madden, The Concise History of the Crusades (3rd ed. 2014), p. 168  Aftermath  The Hospitaller fortress Krak des Chevaliers fell three years later.Richard and Birrell, The Crusades, 419. While Louis IX of France launched the Eighth Crusade ostensibly to reverse these setbacks, it went to Tunis, instead of Constantinople, as Louis' brother, Charles of Anjou, had initially advised, though Charles I clearly benefited from the treaty between Antioch and Tunis that ultimately resulted from the Crusade. By the time of his death in 1277, Baibars had confined the Crusaders to a few strongholds along the coast and they were forced out of the Middle East by the beginning of the fourteenth century. The fall of Antioch was to prove as detrimental to the crusaders cause as its capture was instrumental in the initial success of the first Crusade.

Had he survived, he would have united the three kingdoms (Castile and Le√≥n, Aragon, and Portugal) and brought about an Iberian Union. Miguel da Paz, Hereditary Prince of Portugal and Prince of Asturias (, ; , \\"Michael of Peace\\") (23 August 1498 - 19 July 1500) was a Portuguese royal prince, son of King Manuel I of Portugal and his first wife, Isabella of Aragon, Princess of Asturias (1470-1498). Life and Death Miguel da Paz was born in Zaragoza, Spain on 23 August 1498. His mother, Isabella of Aragon, died within an hour of his birth. He was shortly sworn heir to the various Iberian crowns by the courts of Portugal, Castile and Aragon. For the next two years, he was the recognized heir of his father's kingdom of Portugal and of the kingdoms of Castile, Le√≥n and Aragon, which he would inherit from his grandparents, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. As such, he was styled Prince of Portugal, Prince of Asturias and Prince of Girona. Miguel died in Granada on 19 July 1500, in his grandmother's arms. He was buried in the Capilla Real, in Granada. In October 1500, Miguel's father married Maria of Aragon, who was also the younger sister of Miguel's mother. Maria gave birth to Manuel's eventual successor, John III and to several other children. The hopes of Isabella I and Ferdinand II to unite all of the Iberian kingdoms vanished with Miguel's death. After he died, another of Miguel's maternal aunts, Joanna became the heiress of Castile, Le√≥n and Aragon, eventually bringing those kingdoms to the Habsburgs, under Joanna's son, Charles V. However, the Iberian Union, although short-lived, took place eighty years later, from 1580 to 1640, under the Habsburg King Philip II of Spain, Miguel's half-great-nephew and the grandson of Joanna of Castile, Manuel of Portugal and Maria of Aragon, acquired Portugal and its dominions (see the Philippine Dynasty).

Many of the developments in French arts in this period parallel changes in literature. For more on this, see French literature of the 19th century. For more on French history, see History of France. Romanticism The French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars brought great changes to the arts in France. The program of exaltation and mythification of the Emperor Napoleon I of France was closely coordinated in the paintings of Gros and Gu√©rin. Meanwhile, Orientalism, Egyptian motifs, the tragic anti-hero, the wild landscape, the historical novel and scenes from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, all these elements of Romanticism created a vibrant period that defies classicism. The Massacre at Chios - Eug√®ne Delacroix One also finds in the early period of the 19th century a repeat of the debate carried on in the 17th between the supporters of Rubens and Poussin: there are defenders of the \\"line\\" as found in Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, and the violent colors and curves as found in Eug√®ne Delacroix. The comparison is however somewhat false, for Ingres' intense realism sometimes gives way to amazing voluptuousness in his Turkish bath scenes. Romanticism is a literary language based on feelings. Writers who illustrated this concept included John Keats and Benjamin Constant. The Romantic tendencies continued throughout the century: both idealized landscape painting and Naturalism have their seeds in Romanticism: both Gustave Courbet and the Barbizon school are logical developments, as is too the late 19th century Symbolism of such painters at Gustave Moreau (the professor of Matisse and Rouault) or Odilon Redon. Auguste Rodin and Camille Claudel are the most famous sculptors of their time. Birth of the Modern Walter Benjamin called Paris \\"the capital of the 19th century\\". In order to understand the amazing diversity of artistic expressions which Paris gave birth to from the 1860s to all nightboulevards, but also replaced poorer neighborhoods and created fast routes to move troops through the city to quell unrest. Yet there was also a second Paris at the limits of Haussmann's city on the hill of Montmartre with her windmills, cabarets and vineyards. Caf√© culture, cabarets, arcades (19th century covered malls), anarchism, the mixing of classes, the radicalization of art and artistic movements caused by the academic salon system, a boisterous willingness to shock -- all this made for a stunning vibrancy. What is more, the dynamic debate in the visual arts is also repeated in the same period in music, dance, architecture and the novel: Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Proust, Nijinski, etc. This is the birth of Modernism. √âdouard Manet represents for many critics the division between the 19th century and the modern period (much like Charles Baudelaire in poetry). His rediscovery of Spanish painting from the golden age, his willingness to show the unpainted canvas, his exploration of the forthright nude and his radical brush strokes are the first step toward Impressionism. The Luncheon on the Grass (Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe) - √âdouard Manet Impression, Sunrise (Impression, soleil levant) - Claude Monet Impressionism would take the Barbizon school one further, rejecting once and for all a belabored style (and the use of mixed colors and black), for fragile transitive effects of light as captured outdoors in changing light (in part inspired by the paintings of J. M. W. Turner). Claude Monet with his cathedrals and haystacks, Pierre-Auguste Renoir with both his early outdoor festivals and his later feathery style of ruddy nudes, Edgar Degas with his dancers and bathers. Some of these techniques were made possible by new paints available in tubes. These painters were also to a certain degree in a dialogue with another discovery of the 19th century: photography. From this point on, the next thirty years were a litany of amazing experiments. Vincent van Gogh, Dutch born but living in France, opened the road to expressionism. Georges Seurat, influenced by color theory, devised a pointillist technique that controlled the Impressionist experiment. Paul C√©zanne, a painter's painter, attempted a geometrical exploration of the world (that left many of his peers indifferent). Paul Gauguin, the banker, found symbolism in Brittany and then exoticism and primitivism in French Polynesia. Henri Rousseau, the self-taught dabbler, becomes the model for the na√Øve revolution.

In 1775, Captain George Cartwright, for whom the place is named, settled there, establishing a fish and fur trading business. He left Labrador in 1786, maintaining a business interest there until it was sold to Hunt and Henley in 1815. It was again sold in 1873 to the Hudson's Bay Company and has remained under company ownership ever since.

Climate Cartwright has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with very snowy winters and short, mild summers. Owing to its maritime location, the winters are however a little milder than on most of the Labrador Peninsula, but snow depth from the stormy Icelandic Low, which circulates cold and saturated air around the region, is extreme: it averages around at its peak early in March and has reached as high as on April 7, 2003. Snow is usually fully melted early in June and is established again in mid-October.

Hallgrim Hanseg√•rd (Frikar) demonstrating the Halling during the annual Peer Gynt Festival at Lake G√•l√•. The Halling (hallingdansen) is a folk dance (bygdedans) traditionally performed in rural Norway, although versions of the halling can also be found in parts of Sweden. The dance is traditionally performed by young men at weddings and parties. Overview The halling is a quick (95‚Äì106 bpm) dance in or that includes acrobatic, athletic competition between the dancers. Hallingdans can best be described as rhythmic acrobatic dance and consists of a number of steps which requires both strength and softness elation.Norwegian Traditional Music (Folkemusikk og folkedansorganisasjonen i Noreg) The dance is associated with the valleys and traditional districts of Valdres and Hallingdal, where it is often referred to as the laus (loose dance). The term refers to it being danced solo, not in couples (although coupled halling dancing is traditional in the western parts of the country). According to some scholars, the word may refer to the fact that the dance was \\"half\\" the performance, as the other half was the springar (after the fashion of a Renaissance dance suite). The meter of the dance is or of a quite fast (95‚Äì106 bpm), sharp quality which calls for an experienced musician. The musician has to give the dancers enough impetus to perform the various challenging moves that are involved in the dance such as the nakkespretten (neck jump), kruking (hooked dancing), hodestift (going over the head) and especially the kast (throw). The dancer Olav Thorshaug performed hallingdans shows in the United States of America around 1910‚Äì1920, incorporating the headspin in his dance. One of the dance moves is called hallingkast. In this move, a girl has traditionally held a hat high using a stick or something similar, and the dancer is supposed to kick down the hat. Kast is seen as the test of strength, which involves kicking a hat that is held about 230 to 280 cm above the floor. Some girls have been able dancers themselves, and known to be as agile as any man.Halling (Store norske leksikon)  In popular culture  Noted Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg composed several pieces of music for the halling dance in his Lyric Pieces.Halling (Norwegian Dance) Op.38 No. 4 (Edvard Grieg song list) The finale of Geirr Tveitt's Piano Concerto No. 5, published in 1954, is described as 'Tempo di Halling'. The dance was performed by the Frikar Dance Company to the Norwegian winning contribution for the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest, \\"Fairytale\\", by singer and fiddle player Alexander Rybak. Frikar Dance Company has toured 29 countries with halling dance the last years. The company's founder and choreographer Hallgrim Hanseg√•rd is known as the reinventor of halling, exploring the tradition in meeting with new artistic expressions and arenas as for example in the computer game \\"Age of Conan\\".Norwegian halling dance heads to Eurovision 2009 (Multe Music) ReferencesExternal links *The history of hallingdans *Dancers performing the Halling (Multe Music) *The home page of Frikar Dance Company *The youtube channel of Frikar Dance Company *Geirr Tveitt's Piano Concerto No. 5: Finale in Spotify Category:Norwegian folk dances Category:Norwegian folk music Category:Partner dance Category:Nordic folk music Category:Dance in Norway ","title":"Halling (dance)"},{"id":"2463252","text":"Franjo Kre≈æma Franjo Kre≈æma (2 September 1862 ‚Äì 15 June 1881), also known as Franz Krezma in German-speaking countries, was a Croatian violinist and composer.

The first half of the 20th century in France saw the even more revolutionary experiments of Cubism, Dada and Surrealism, artistic movements that would have a major impact on western, and eventually world, art. After World War II, while French artists explored such tendencies as Tachism, Fluxus and New realism, France's preeminence in the visual arts progressively became eclipsed by developments elsewhere (the United States in particular). From Impressionism to World War II Albert Gleizes, 1912, Les Baigneuses (The Bathers), oil on canvas, 105 x 171 cm, Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris The early years of the twentieth century were dominated by Neo- Impressionism and Divisionism, experiments in colour and content that Impressionism, Post-Impressionism and Symbolism had unleashed. The products of the far east also brought new influences. Les Nabis explored a decorative art in flat plains with a Japanese print graphic approach. From 1904 Les Fauves exploded in color (much like German Expressionism). The influence of African tribal masks led Pablo Picasso to his Demoiselles d'Avignon of 1907. Picasso and Georges Braque (working independently) returned to and refined C√©zanne's way of rationally understanding objects in a flat medium; but their experiments in cubism would also lead them to integrate all aspects of day-to- day life: newspapers, musical instruments, cigarettes, wine. Picasso and Braque exhibited their analytical Cubism under an exclusivity contract at the gallery of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, located on a quiet street behind La Madeleine in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. At the same time, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, Robert Delaunay and Fernand L√©ger exhibited alternate forms of Cubism at the Salon des Ind√©pendants and the Salon d'Automne; massive exhibitions that brought Cubism to the attention of the general public. These artists had no intention of analyzing and describing mundane objects from daily life‚Äîa bowl of fruit, a pipe, violin or guitar‚Äîbut chose subjects of vast proportion, of provocative social and cultural significance, expressing the dynamic qualities of modern urban life.Daniel Robbins, 1964, Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition, Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund. Cubism in all its phases and divers styles would dominate Europe and America for the next ten years. Jean Metzinger, 1911, Le go√ªter (Tea Time), oil on canvas, 75.9 x 70.2 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art. Exhibited at the 1911 Salon d'Automne. Published in Fantasio, 15 Oct. 1911, Du \\"Cubisme\\" by Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, 1912, and Les Peintres Cubistes by Guillaume Apollinaire, 1913, Paris. Andr√© Salmon dubbed this painting \\"The Mona Lisa of Cubism\\" World War I did not stop the dynamic creation of art in France. In 1916 a group of discontents met in a bar in Zurich (the Cabaret Voltaire) and create the most radical gesture possible: the anti-art of Dada. At the same time, Francis Picabia and Marcel Duchamp were exploring similar notions. At an art show in New York in 1917 Duchamp presented a white porcelain urinal signed R. Mutt as work of art, becoming the father of the \\"readymade\\". The killing fields of the war (nearly one-tenth of the French adult male population had been killed or wounded) had made many see the absurdity of existence. This was also the period when the Lost Generation took hold: rich Americans enjoying the liberties of Prohibition-free France in the 1920s and poor G.I.'s going abroad for the first time. Paris was also, for African-Americans, amazingly free of the racial restrictions found in America (James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Josephine Baker). When Dada reached Paris, it was avidly embraced by a group of young artists and writers who were fascinated with the writings of Sigmund Freud, and particularly by the notion of the unconscious mind. The provocative spirit of Dada became linked to the exploration of the unconscious mind through the use of automatic writing, chance operations and, in some cases, altered states. The surrealists quickly turned to painting and sculpture. The shock of unexpected elements, the use of Frottage, collage and decalcomania, the rendering of mysterious landscapes and dreamscapes were to become the key techniques through the rest of the 1930s. World War II ended the feast. Many surrealists like Yves Tanguy, Max Ernst, Andr√© Breton and Andr√© Masson fled occupied France for New York and the States (Duchamp had already been in the U.S. since 1936), but the cohesion and vibrancy were lost in the American city. For a chronological list of artists from the period, go here. Post World War II The French art scene immediately after the war went roughly in several directions. There were those who continued in the artistic experiments of the 1930s and 1940s, especially Surrealism and Geometric abstraction, and there were those associated with Lyrical abstraction, Tachisme, Nuagisme, Art Informel and ' (modes of expression along similar lines as Abstract Expressionism or action painting from New York). These artists included Wols, Jean Fautrier, Hans Hartung, Jean-Paul Riopelle, Jean Degottex, Pierre Soulages, Jean Messagier and Georges Mathieu.Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, Younger European painters: a selection, exhibition catalogue, 2 December 1953 - 21 February 1954 At the same time, Jean Dubuffet dominated the early post-war years while exploring childlike drawings, graffiti and cartoons in a variety of media in what he called \\"Art Brut\\" (see Outsider art). Meanwhile, Fran√ßois Fiedler went searching for the perfect combination of color and texture amongst the multitudinous layers of paint that found its way onto his canvas. In 1960, Pierre Restany and Yves Klein founded the New Realism movement (in French: Nouveau R√©alisme), and a joint declaration was signed on October 27, 1960, by nine people: Yves Klein, Arman, Francois Dufr√™ne, Raymond Hains, Martial Raysse, Pierre Restany, Daniel Spoerri, Jean Tinguely and Jacques de la Villegl√©; in 1961 these were joined by C√©sar, Mimmo Rotella, then Niki de Saint Phalle and G√©rard Deschamps. The artist Christo joined the group in 1963. The members of the group saw the world as an image, from which they would take parts and incorporate them into their works. They sought to bring life and art closer together, and has often been compared with Pop Art. Yves Klein had nude women roll around in blue paint and throw themselves at canvases; Niki de Saint-Phalle created bloated and vibrant plastic figures; Arman gathered together found objects in boxed or resin-coated assemblages; C√©sar Baldaccini produced a series of large compressed object-sculptures (similar to Chamberlain's crushed automobiles); Daniel Spoerri used meals and food as artistic material. Associated in various ways with New Realism, the artists of the international Fluxus movement - named and loosely organized in 1962 by George Maciunas (1931‚Äì78), a Lithuanian-born American artist - encouraged a do it yourself aesthetic, and valued simplicity over complexity. Like Dada before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an anti-art sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues. Outsourcing part of the creative process to commercial fabricators was not usually part of Fluxus practice. The most significant French Fluxus artist, Ben Vautier incorporated graffiti and found objects into his work. Other artist in the period include Victor Vasarely who invented Op-Art by designing sophisticated optical patterns. In May 1968, the radical youth movement, through their atelier populaire, produced a great deal of poster-art protesting the moribund policies of president Charles de Gaulle. For a chronological list of artists from the period, go here. Contemporary art in France Many contemporary artists continue to be haunted by the horrors of the war and the specter of the holocaust. Christian Boltanski's harrowing installations of the lost and the anonymous are particularly powerful. The work of his wife Annette Messager, who represented France at the 2005 Venice Biennale, deals with issues of identity and feminism. The photographer, installation artist and conceptual artist Sophie Calle's work is distinguished by its use of arbitrary sets of constraints, and evokes the French literary movement of the 1960s known as Oulipo. Her work frequently depicts human vulnerability, and examines identity and intimacy. She is recognized for her detective-like ability to follow strangers and investigate their private lives. Her photographic work often includes panels of text of her own writing. Beginning in the 1980s, the Figuration Libre movement was constituted around French figures like Remi Blanchard, Fran√ßois Boisrond, Robert Combas, Herv√© Di Rosa, Richard Di Rosa and Louis Jammes. Between 1982 and 1985, these artists exhibited on several occasions with their American counterparts: Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Kenny Scharf, Tseng Kwong Chi and inter alia, Crash (exhibitions in New York, London, Pittsburgh, and Paris). The Figuration Libre falls under the prolongation of artists and historical movements whose specificity was the opening to marginalized forms of expression, as the Cubism had opened with African art and Oceanic art (amongst other influences), and \\"art brut\\" with the children's drawings, Pop art with advertising and comic strips. Pierre et Gilles (Pierre Commoy and Gilles Blanchard), are gay French artistic and romantic partners. They produce highly stylized photographs, building their own sets and costumes as well as retouching the photographs. Their work often features images from popular culture, gay culture including porn (especially James Bidgood), and religion. Other important contemporary French artists include Jean-Pierre Raynaud, Orlan, Ernest Pignon-Ernest, Daniel Buren, Jean-Marc Bustamante, Pierre Huyghe, Val√©rie Mr√©jen.

The rule was formulated by German chemist Fritz Haber in the early 1900s. Rule Haber's rule states that, for a given poisonous gas, C\\\\times t = k, where C is the concentration of the gas (mass per unit volume), t is the amount of time necessary to breathe the gas to produce a given toxic effect, and k is a constant, depending on both the gas and the effect. Thus, the rule states that doubling the concentration will halve the time, for example. It makes equivalent any two groupings of dose concentration and exposure time that have equivalent mathematical products. For instance, if we assign dose concentration the symbol C, and time the classic t, then for any two dose schema, if C1t1=C2t2, then under Haber's rule the two dose schema are equivalent. Haber's rule is an approximation, useful with certain inhaled poisons under certain conditions, and Haber himself acknowledged that it was not always applicable. If a substance is efficiently eliminated in the host, for example, then Haber's Law breaks down in the limit of t approaching the order of the half-life of the drug, rewriting the equation as the integral ‚à´Cdt = constant for arbitrary varying C and elapsed time T. It is very convenient, however, because its relationship between C and t appears as a straight line in a log-log plot. In 1940, statistician C. I. Bliss published a study of toxicity in insecticides in which he proposed more complex models, for example, expressing the relationship between C and t as two straight line segments in a log-log plot. However, because of its simplicity, Haber's rule continued to be widely used. Recently, some researchers have argued that it is time to move beyond the simple relationship expressed by Haber's rule and to make regular use of more sophisticated models.

Lu√≠s succeeded his father as the Duke of Beja and was also made Constable of the Kingdom (Portuguese: Condest√°vel do Reino) and Prior of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, with its Portuguese headquarters in the town of Crato.  Conquest of Tunis  In the Conquest of Tunis (1535) Lu√≠s, brother-in-law of Charles V, commanded the Portuguese army. The Portuguese galleon S√£o Jo√£o Baptista, also known as Botafogo was specifically requested by Charles V, and it was the most powerful ship in the world at the time, with 366 bronze cannons.

Some say they eventually married perhaps at √âvora, thus legitimating their issue for every purpose. Their son Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato, would be one of the claimants to the throne after the death of King Sebastian of Portugal in the disastrous Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir and the subsequent dynastic crisis that followed, and, according to some historians, the King of Portugal for approximately a month in the year 1580. They may have also had other sons named Juan Gomez de Portugal (1536-1610), and Joanes Gomez de Portugal (b.1540). Juan would become one of the founders of Villa de Santa Mar√≠a de los Lagos, Nueva Galicia (later renamed Lagos de Moreno) in present-day Jalisco, Mexico on 31 March 1563.

The group has also adapted stories such as \\"Pocahontas,\\" \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" and \\"The Jungle Book\\" into original musicals. Classes are offered each session at each branch, as well as summer camps throughout the summer. Classes are typically 10 weeks long. More unusual topics are often covered such as improvisational theatre, theatrical makeup, set construction, accents and dialects, stunts, special effects and theatre criticism. In CYT, at least one parent is typically expected to serve on a committee. These committees perform tasks such as building sets and props, supervising the backstage crew, and supervising the lights/sound technical team in the booth (which is composed of both adult committee members and non-adults, typically with a minimum age of 10 and ranging in age up to 18).

Darfur Still Deaf? (2007) at the 52nd Venice Biennale Vanessa Beecroft (born April 25, 1969) is an Italian-born American contemporary performance artist; she also works with photography, video art, sculpture, and painting. Many of her works have made use of professional models, sometimes in large numbers and sometimes naked or nearly so, to stage tableaux vivants.Francis Summers. Beecroft, Vanessa. Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford: Oxford University Press. . She works in the United States, and is based in Los Angeles . Her early work was focused on gender and appeared to be autobiographical; her later work is focused on race. Starting in 2008 she began working with Kanye West on collaborations and commercial projects.  Early life and education  Vanessa Beecroft was born April 25, 1969 in Genoa, Italy and raised in Santa Margherita Ligure and Malcesine near Lake Garda. Both of her parents were teachers; she was born to an Italian mother, Maria Luisa and a British father, Andrew Beecroft. After she was born, her family briefly moved to Holland Park, west London. Her parents divorced when she was three years old and she did not see her father or her younger brother again until she was 15 years old. Her mother raised Beecroft alone in a village in Italy in a strict vegan household with no cars, no television, and no phone. In childhood, she was hospitalized for overeating specific foods she thought would cleanse her system, and she struggled with an eating disorder. From 1988 to 1993 she attended Brera Academy in Milan, Italy. Her first art exhibition VB01 (1993) was in a gallery in Milan and featured a performance with other female students from Brera Academy wearing Beecroft's clothing, and sharing Beecroft's \\"Book of Food\\", a diary documenting her food consumption from 1985 and 1993. The \\"Book of Food\\" documented Beecroft's bulimic eating habits and was referenced again in her later work, but it was separate from the performances. She moved to the United States in 1996 at the invitation of art dealer Jeffrey Deitch, settling in New York City. Art Her performance work about gender was often critiqued for being a \\"post- feminist statement about fashion or pandering to a corrupted way of seeing\\". Photographer Collier Schorr noted, \\"Beecroft is interested in the aesthetics of how women look when they are looked at, and her body-conscious projects encourage alienation between model, artist, and audience.\\" Some common themes in the work include self discipline (of the models), voyeurism, and power relationships. Beecroft's artwork is often performance or installation-based with live human figures, but she also documents the performances with photography and video; this work is in many public museum and art collections including the Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a, √ñsterreichische Galerie Belvedere, Van Abbemuseum, amongst others. = VB performances (1993‚Äìpresent) = Many of the VB performances were documented in the Dave Hickey book VB 08-36: Vanessa Beecroft Performances (2000), and in Emily L. Newman's book Female Body Image in Contemporary Art: Dieting, Eating Disorders, Self-Harm, and Fatness (2018). The performances were titled sequentially. Strict rules were imposed on the models' behavior during the performances; they were instructed not to engage with the audience. Models were uniformed, nude, or barely clothed and were required to stand for hours, often in tall high heels without movement or eye contact. Beecroft always used tall, thin, young models who she referred to as \\"girls\\", regardless of their age. In later work, Beecroft would use designer accessories or shoes as props for the models. * VB02, VB03, VB04, and VB08 took place in 1994 and featured live girl models all dressed in bright red wigs (an exaggerated representation of Beecroft's own hair color) and white underwear. VB08 (1994) performance took place at MoMA PS1 in Long Island City, New York, using live female models, pantyhose, and bright red wigs. * VB25 (1996) performance took place at Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, Netherlands, with seven identical-looking young women wearing fake eyelashes and red nail polish, each dressed in a polo-neck pullover, white underwear, tights, and high heels. * VB35: Show (1998) took place at the Guggenheim Museum in New York; twenty women stood in the museum for two hours in a circular arrangement in order to mirror the architecture. Fifteen of the women wore rhinestone- decorated bikinis designed by Tom Ford, and five of the women were nude. This was a larger event than some of her prior work and made international news. Casting was done by Jennifer Starr * VB45 (2004) took place at Terminal 5 of the John F. Kennedy Airport with 36 young women standing in formation in the sunken waiting area, wearing only Afro wigs, black body paint, and silver shackles on their ankles. * VB51 (2002) was her first filmed performance, it took place in Schloss Vinsebeck, Stenheim, Germany. It featured older models in their 60s, including Beecroft's mother, mother-in-law, stepsister, and the actresses Irm Hermann and Hanna Schygulla (both actresses from films by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Beecroft's favorite director). *VB53 (2004) at the Tepidarium in Giardino dell‚ÄôOrticultura, Florence, Italy, women were staged in a mound of dirt, as if they were plants. * VB55 (2005) featured one hundred women standing still in Berlin's Neue Nationalgalerie for three hours, each woman oiled from the waist up and wearing nothing but a pair of pantyhose. *VB61, Still Death! Darfur Still Deaf? (2007), one of Beecroft's most politically-engaged performances, was presented the 52nd Venice Biennale. It involved \\"approximately 30 Sudanese women with their skin painted, lying face- down on a white canvas on the ground, simulating dead bodies piled on top of one another\\", representing the genocide in Darfur, Sudan. * VB65 (March 2009) performance at Padiglione d'Arte Contemporanea (PAC) in Milan, Italy, featured a \\"Last Supper\\" of twenty African immigrant men, dressed formally in suits (some without shoes), drinking water, eating chicken and brown bread without cutlery. *VB66 (2010) took place at (the fish market), Naples, Italy with fifty living models, staged on a platform amongst a group of cast body sculptures and body parts, all painted black. It highlighted the relationships among body, sculpture, and an iconographical reference to the nearby ruins of Pompeii. *VB67 (2010) performance took place at Studio Nicoli in Carrara, Italy, and again a similar reenactment in a year later, VB70: Marmi (2011) at Lia Rumma gallery in Milan. The models were staged near marble sculpture statues and the stone was in various states including polished, rough, and in blocks and slabs. = Other work = In October 2005, Beecroft staged a three- hour performance on the occasion of the opening of the Louis Vuitton store, \\"Espace Louis Vuitton\\" on the Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris. For the same event, Beecroft placed models both black and white on the shelves next to Louis Vuitton bags in a \\"human alphabet\\". In 2007 the Louis Vuitton company apologized to Dutch graphic designer Anthon Beeke for mimicking his \\"Naked Ladies Alphabet\\" design without his consent. In 2018, Beecroft and Kim Kardashian collaborated on a series of nude photos of Kardashian that were displayed on social media for the release of Kardashian's perfume, which had a \\"Kardashian body-shaped bottle\\". Collaborations with Kanye West Since 2008, Beecroft has been collaborating on work with artist Kanye West. They began working together with a listening party at Ace Gallery, Los Angeles for West's music albums 808s and Heartbreaks. In 2010, Beecroft was named creative lead for the Runaway music video. On the Kanye West music tour, the Yeezus Tour (October 2013 ‚Äì September 2014), Beecroft designed the sets and choreography. Beecroft worked on West's Spike Jonze directed music video for the 2014 song ‚ÄúOnly One‚Äù. In 2014, Beecroft assembled and built the wedding ceremony of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West . In February 2015, West embarked on a fashion design career with Yeezy Season 1, under the Adidas label and Beecroft directed the performance presentation. Beecroft went on to work on Yeezy Season 2 (September 2015), Yeezy Season 3 (February 2016), and Yeezy Season 4 (September 2016). Beecroft alleged she was a full-time employee for West until 2016, when her role changed and she became a part-time contractor. In 2019, she collaborated with West on two opera-based performances, Nebuchadnezzar and Mary.  Controversies  Beecroft's work with live female nude models in performances often uses a specific type of model, one with an Westernized \\"idealization\\" of the female body, all of the models appearing uniformly thin, tall, and young. These choices have been criticized as harmful, distorted, and conforming to gender stereotypes. Beecroft has been quoted in an interview in 2016, ‚ÄúI have divided my personality. There is Vanessa Beecroft as a European white female, and then there is Vanessa Beecroft as Kanye, an African-American male.‚Äù Her later work deals with race, and she has made a series of racially insensitive remarks in interviews. Personal Vanessa Beecroft was previously married to marketer Greg Durkin. They lived in Cold Spring Harbor, New York together for many years. The marriage ended in divorce. Durkin and Beecroft had two sons together (born in 2001 and 2004). She is currently married to photographer Federico Spadoni. Beecroft and Spadoni have one daughter and one son together (born 2009 and 2012). Beecroft‚Äôs failed attempt to adopt Sudanese twins was the topic of the documentary The Art Star and the Sudanese Twins (2008) by Pietra Brettkelly, which was included in the Sundance Film Festival's World Cinema Documentary Competition. The film presents Beecroft as a \\"hypocritically self-aware, colossally colonial pomo narcissist\\" and chronicles her \\"damaging quotes and appalling behavior\\" as she attempts to adopt the orphans for use in an art exhibit.

It is situated about north-east of Driffield town centre. According to the 2011 UK census, Kilham parish had a population of 1,088, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 1,010. History In 1823 Kilham civil parish was in the Wapentake of Dickering and the Liberty of St Peter's. A market had previously been held on Thursdays. The parish church was under the patronage of the Dean of York. There existed a free grammar school, founded () by Lord D'Arcy of Aston. A mineral spring near the road to Rudston, was supposed curative for disorders. A further spring, called Henpit Hole, was near the road to Langtoft, which during a wet autumn would spout with \\"violence\\". A Methodist and a Baptists chapel existed in the village. Population at the time was 971. Occupations included twenty-two farmers, seven shoemakers, five grocers, three of whom were also drapers, four blacksmiths, four tailors, four bricklayers, three joiners, two butchers, two glove makers, a brick & tile maker, a draper, a bacon factor (wholesale tradesman), a plumber & glazier, a bookseller, a saddler, a fellmonger, a corn miller, a gardener & seedsman, and the landlords of the Royal Oak, Plough, Star, and Black Bull public houses. Within the parish were two surgeons, a schoolmaster, four gentlemen and two gentlewomen, a Baptist minister, a curate and a vicar, a yeoman, an Esquire, two Royal Navy masters and a Royal Navy lieutenant. Two carriers operated between the village and Driffield, Beverley, Hull, and Bridlington once a week. Kilham was once an important market town in the Yorkshire Wolds, bigger and more important than Driffield at one time. It held annual trading fairs and had a large number of businesses and a considerable population. The town declined in size and status following the building of the Driffield Navigation, which took trade away from Kilham to nearby Driffield. Kilham lies on the line of a Roman road from York to Bridlington, now followed by the minor road known as Woldgate. To the south of Kilham there is evidence of a Romano-British settlement from the 4th century. Community Kilham's Grade I listed Anglican parish church is dedicated to All Saints. The church holds an annual flower festival. Outside the church is an old tethering ring in a stone block - evidence of the cattle trade which once took place in the village. There is also a cast-iron water pump opposite the church. At one time there were six schools in the village, but only one now remains, Kilham C. of E. primary school. In 2010 the Kilham Playing Field Association opened a recreational playing field on Back Lane, to provide a full-sized football pitch, a 5-a-side football pitch, grass tennis courts, adventure playground and cycle track. The Association, a registered charity, has been funded locally and through the Big Lottery fund and Grassroots.

In the United States, it is usually offered at an institution of higher education, such as a college or university. The most common type of these undergraduate degrees are associate's degree and bachelor's degree. Bachelor's degree typically takes at least three or four years to complete. In some other educational systems, undergraduate education is post-secondary education up to the level of a master's degree; this is the case for some science courses in Britain and some long-cycle medicine courses in Europe. These degrees can be categorised as basic or first professional degrees. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, a bachelor's degree is the most common type of \\"undergraduate degree\\". Some master's degrees can be undertaken immediately after finishing secondary education; however, these courses are usually extended versions of bachelor's degree programs, taking an additional year to complete. Most bachelor's degrees take three years to complete, with some notable exceptions, such as Medicine taking five years. Often students can initially enroll in a 4-year program then leave after three years and be awarded a bachelor's degree. North America First professional degrees sometimes contain the word Doctor, but are still considered undergraduate degrees in most countries, including Canada.The Undergraduate MD Program at the University of Alberta For example, the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) program in Canada is considered an \\"undergraduate degree.\\" However, in the United States, most first professional degrees are considered graduate programs by the U.S. Department of Education and require students to already possess an \\"undergraduate degree\\" before admission. These degrees are not research doctorates and are therefore not equivalent to the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) Many countries offer bachelor's degrees that are equivalent to American graduate degrees. For example, the Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degrees offered in the U.S. are equivalent to the Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBS or MBChB) degree. In the United States and sometimes in Canada, an Associate Degree is a two-year degree. It is occasionally undertaken as the beginning of a four-year degree. Some two-year institutions have articulation agreements with four-year institutions, which specify which courses transfer without problems. =United States= Arizona  The Arizona General Education Curriculum certification (AGEC), awarded for the completion of an Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, or Associate of Business degree respectively, indicates the completion of all bachelor's degree lower level course work and permits the student to block transfer to any of the three state universities and several private universities as a third-year student or \\"Junior.\\" To obtain an AGEC certification, one must: * Complete all associate degree credits at regionally accredited colleges (no Secondary (High) School credits accepted); * Satisfy all their bachelor's degree Lower Division Credits and Courses; * Meet credit transfer restriction guidelines; * Maintain a minimum GPA of 2.0 Although an AGEC certification meets the requirements for the bachelor's degree Lower Level it may or may not meet any prerequisite requirements for any given degree program. Associates degrees with an AGEC certification are often custom tailored with electives to meet the prerequisite requirements for the program and university the student wishes to transfer to.  Virginia  Virginia's community college has signed system-wide agreements, allowing students who graduate from one of the 23 community colleges with a transfer associate degree and a minimum grade point average to obtain guaranteed admission to more than 20 of the Commonwealth's four-year colleges and universities. South America Argentina = Argentine higher education system is based on the Spanish higher education system, which is basically a Continental education system (in contrast to the model in the English-speaking world). During the University Reform of 1918, a series of reforms that took place in the Universidad de C√≥rdoba that further changed the Argentine educational system. Currently there are three levels: * Tertiary degree: 1 to 2 years degrees aimed at producing highly specialised and trained workforce. * Graduate degree: 4 to 6 years programs taught at Universities offering licentiate, engineering and medical degrees. * Post-graduate: Specialised and research-oriented courses and programs. With masters or doctorate degrees being offer depending on the program. = Bolivia = Education in Bolivia, as in many other areas of Bolivian life, has a divide between Bolivia's rural and urban areas. Rural illiteracy levels remain high, even as the rest of the country becomes increasingly literate. This disparity stems partly from the fact that many children living in rural area ation[dubious ‚Äì discuss] are not necessarily attributable to lack of funding. Bolivia devotes 23% of its annual budget to educational expenditures, a higher percentage than in most other South American countries, albeit from a smaller national budget. A comprehensive, education reform has made some significant changes. Initiated in 1994, the reform decentralized educational funding in order to meet diverse local needs, improved teacher training and curricula, formalized and expanded intercultural bilingual education and changed the school grade system. Resistance from teachers‚Äô unions, however, has slowed implementation of some of the intended reforms (Contreras and Talavera, 2003). *Universidad Cat√≥lica Boliviana Tarija, Unidad Acad√©mica Regional Tarija; *Universidad Cat√≥lica Boliviana Cochabamba, Unidad Acad√©mica Regional Cochabamba; *Universidad Cat√≥lica Boliviana Santa Cruz, Unidad Acad√©mica Regional Santa Cruz; *Unidad Acad√©mica Campesina-Carmen Pampa, Carmen Pampa; a satellite campus of the Catholic University of Bolivia =Brazil= For a better understanding of education levels in Brazil, it is necessary to understand the structure of the higher education in the country. The present Brazilian system is organized according to the law that establishes the guidelines and bases for national education - Law n. 9.394 of December 20, 1996. The classification of institutions of higher education happens according to their academic organization, and the following names are possible: Universities, University Centers, Colleges and Integrated Schools, Colleges and Institutes and Centers of Technological Education. The higher education courses have two different academic levels, known as Undergraduate or Post Graduation. These degrees, have subdivisions in which are distributed programs of higher education in Brazil, and they may be bachelors, licentiates, and associates, for Undergraduate levels. As for specializations, there are MBAs, Post-MBAs programs and for Post-graduation there are academic master's, professional master's degrees and doctorates. At the undergraduate level, there are still community colleges and further education courses. Diplomas and certificates At the undergraduate level, the bachelor's degrees, licentiates and technologist, provide undergraduation diplomas, while colleges and Extension courses provide certificates of completion. The law formalizes a B.A., B.S., Licentiate or Technologist degrees, according to the student's education, and is prerequisite to begin a Postgraduate degree course. In the Postgrad, only students graduating from Stricto Sensu courses, that is, academic or professional master's and doctoral degrees and are given the titles of Master or Doctor, respectively. For students of the Lato Sensu - specializations, MBA programs and Post-MBA programs - is given certificates of completion and the title Specialist. Graduate degrees in Brazil are called \\"postgraduate\\" degrees. * Lato sensu graduate degrees: degrees that represent a specialization in a certain area, and take from 1 to 2 years to complete. Sometimes it can be used to describe a specialization level between a master's degree and an MBA. In that sense, the main difference is that the Lato Sensu courses tend to go deeper into the scientific aspects of the study field, while MBA programs tend to be more focused on the practical and professional aspects, being used more frequently to Business, Management and Administration areas. However, since there are no norms to regulate this, both names are used indiscriminately most of the time. * Stricto sensu graduate degrees: degrees for those who wish to pursue an academic career. ** Masters: 2 years for completion. Usually serves as additional qualification for those seeking a differential on the job market (and maybe later a PhD), or for those who want to pursue a PhD. Most doctoral programs in Brazil require a master's degree (stricto sensu), meaning that a Lato Sensu Degree is usually insufficient to start a doctoral program. ** Doctors / PhD: 3‚Äì4 years for completion. Usually used as a stepping stone for academic life. = Ecuador = The National Polytechnic School (Spanish: Escuela Polit√©cnica Nacional), also known as EPN, is a public university located in Quito, Ecuador. EPN is known for research and education in the applied science, astronomy, atmospheric physics, engineering and physical sciences. The Geophysics Institute monitors over the countries volcanoes in the Andes Mountains of Ecuador and in the Gal√°pagos Islands. EPN adopted the polytechnic university model that stresses laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. The Oldest Observatory in South America is the Quito Astronomical Observatory and is located in Quito, Ecuador. The Quito Astronomical Observatory, which gives the global community a Virtual Telescope System that is connected via the Internet and allows the world to watch by streaming, is managed by EPN. National Polytechnic School houses an international team of seismologists and volcanologists at the Geophysicics Institute with the task of monitoring all the seismic activity in the county. Earthquakes are measured using observations from seismometers. The moment magnitude is the most common scale on which earthquakes larger than approximately 5 are reported for the entire globe. The more numerous earthquakes smaller than magnitude 5 reported by national seismological observatories are measured mostly on the local magnitude scale, also referred to as the Richter magnitude scale. There are many geologists who study the eruptive activity for the volcanoes in the country and observe volcanic eruptions, especially Tungurahua whose volcanic activity restarted on August 19, 1999, and is ongoing , with several major eruptions since that period, the last starting on 1 February 2014. The Geophysics Institute at EPN monitors the Andean Volcanic Belt is a major volcanic belt along the Andean cordillera in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile and Argentina.

There is a single, transparent admission system used by 33 universities (all 25 \\"traditional\\" universities and eight private ones which joined in 2011). The test, called PSU, an acronym for University Selection Test (Prueba de Selecci√≥n Universitaria) is designed and evaluated by the University of Chile, while the system itself is managed by the Ministry of Education (Ministerio de Educaci√≥n). The test consists of two mandatory exams, one in Mathematics and one in Language. There are also two additional specific exams, Sciences (including Chemistry, Physics and Biology fields) and History, depending on which undergraduate program the student wishes to apply to. The cumulative grade point average achieved during secondary school is also taken into account in the final admission score, as well as the student's relative position in his class and two previous promotions. Every university assigns different weightings to the results of the various exams for the various programs offered. Some universities may require additional (non-PSU) tests or personal interviews for admission to some programs. In 2010, a total of 250,752 persons took both mandatory PSU tests.Proceso de Admisi√≥n 2011 Etapa de Rendici√≥on de Pruebas , Universidad de Chile. The University of Chile () is the largest and oldest institution of higher education in Chile and one of the oldest in Latin America. Founded in 1842 as the replacement and continuation of the former colonial Royal University of San Felipe (1738) (Spanish: Real Universidad de San Felipe), the university is often called Casa de Bello (House of Bello) in honor of its first president, Andr√©s Bello. Notable alumni include two Nobel laureates (Pablo Neruda and Gabriela Mistral) and twenty Chilean presidents among many others. The Universidad de Chile was formally opened on 17 September 1843. During this period, the university consisted of five faculties (facultades): Humanities & Philosophy, Physics Sciences & Mathematics, Law & Political Sciences, Medicine, and Theology. By 1931, the number of colleges had increased to six: Philosophy & Education Sciences, Legal & Social Sciences, Biology & Medical Sciences, Physical & Mathematical Sciences, Agronomy & Veterinary, and Fine Arts. Almost all of Chile's presidents graduated from the University of Chile, including all of those in the 20th century with the exception of Eduardo Frei Montalva (Pontifical Catholic University of Chile), General Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo, and former military dictator General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte. Higher education in Chile in colonial times dates to 19 August 1622, when the first university in Chile, Santo Tom√°s de Aquino, was founded. On 28 July 1738, its name changed to Real Universidad de San Felipe, in honor of King Philip V of Spain. The Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (UC or PUC) () is one of the six Catholic Universities existing in the Chilean university system and one of the two Pontifical Universities in the country, along with the Pontifical Catholic University of Valpara√≠so. It is also one of Chile's oldest universities and one of the most recognized educational institutions in Latin America. It ranks 1st in South America by QS ranking. UC was founded on June 21, 1888 by the Santiago Archbishop, to offer training in traditional professions (law) and in technological and practical fields such as business, accounting, chemistry, and electricity. Its first chancellor was Monsignor Joaqu√≠n Larra√≠n Gandarillas, and at the very beginning, the university only taught two subjects, law and mathematics. Since it is a Pontifical University, it has always had a strong and very close relationship with the Vatican. On February 11, 1930, Pope Pius XI declared it a pontifical university, and in 1931 it was granted full academic autonomy by the Chilean government. UC is a private, urban, multi-campus university. It is one of the eleven Chilean Catholic universities, and one of the twenty-five institutions within the Rectors' Council (Consejo de Rectores), the Chilean state-sponsored university system. It is part of the Universities of the Rectors' Council of Chilean Universities, and although it is not state-owned, a substantial part of its budget is given by state transferences under different concepts. UC's 18 faculties are distributed through four campuses in Santiago and one regional campus located in southern Chile. The technical training centers affiliated with the University are: DUOC, the Rural Life Foundations, the Baviera Foundation, the Catechetical Home and the San Fidel Seminary. These centers carry out technical-academic extension activities in rural and agricultural areas. Other UC activities are a Sports Club, a nationwide television network, and a Clinical Hospital dependent on the Faculty of Medicine. UC 's Graduates of the School of Architecture (one of the most prominent in Latin America) have also made important contributions to the country with such work as the Central Building (\\"Casa Central\\") of UC, and the National Library. Two of its most important alumni are the Jesuit Saint Alberto Hurtado and Eduardo Frei Montalva, a Chilean president. Both of them studied in the School of Laws. Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, previous Chilean president, graduated from the university's School of Economics. Pontifical Catholic University of Chile ranks among the first 10 Latin-American Universities according to the Shanghai ranking, and is 1st according to the QS ranking. UC has four campuses in Santiago and one campus in Villarrica. The campuses in Santiago are: * Casa Central (in downtown Santiago) * San Joaqu√≠n (in Macul Commune of Greater Santiago) * Oriente (in Providencia Commune of Greater Santiago) * Lo Contador (also in Providencia Commune) These four campuses have a total of 223,326.06 m2 constructed in a 614,569.92 m2 area. The Villarrica campus has 1,664 m2 constructed in a 2,362.5 m2 area.

The Department of Industry and System Engineering is engaging Stanford Technology Venture Program of Stanford University on a collaboration on innovation and technology ventures. In December 2011, the schools of engineering of PUC and the University of Notre Dame signed an agreement to establish a dual graduate degree in civil engineering and the geological sciences, which now extends to other departments in both schools. In April 2013, PUC and the University of Notre Dame also signed a memorandum of understanding to strengthen scholarly engagement and expand their long- standing relationships. The agreement establishes an exchange program in which faculty, doctoral students and university representatives from each institution will visit, work, study and collaborate with the other institution. = Paraguay = The Universidad Cat√≥lica \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n\\" is a private university of Catholic obedience in Paraguay. It has 8 teaching facility centers. The Universidad Nacional de Asunci√≥n, abbreviated UNA, is a public university in Paraguay.

Retrieved on June 15, 2007. According to the Constitution, education is compulsory and free in public schools for the initial, primary and secondary levels.Constituci√≥n Pol√≠tica del Per√∫, Article N¬∫ 17. It is also free in public universities for students who are unable to pay tuition and have an adequate academic performance. As of 2008, various institutions such as UNESCO, World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank have stated that Peru has the best education system in Latin America and that primary, secondary, and superior education attendance rates were the highest in Latin America. The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) has however placed Peru at the bottom of the ranking in all three categories (Math, science and reading) in 2012 compared to the 65 nations participating in the study of 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance. Higher education in the form of universities began in Peru with the establishment of the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos by the Royal Decree issued by King Carlos V on May 12, 1551. The institute opened as the Sala Capitular del Convento de Santo Domingo in 1553. In 1571, it obtained Papal approval and in 1574 it received the name of Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos. The precursor to the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, the \\"Estudio General o Universidad,\\" was established in Cusco by the Dominicans on July 1, 1548. This institution was responsible for teaching evangelists for the new lands, and taught scripture, theology, grammar, and the Quechuan language. The National University of Saint Anthony the Abbot in Cuzco (UNSAAC) is a public university in Cusco, Peru and one of the oldest in the country. Its foundation was first proposed on March 1, 1692, at the urging and support of Pope Innocent XII. The document in which Pope Innocent XII sponsored the founding of the university was signed in Madrid, Spain by King Charles II on June 1, 1692, thus becoming Cusco's principal and oldest university. The university was authorized to confer the bachelors, licentiate, masters, and doctorate degrees. Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (, PUCP) is a private university in Lima, Peru. It was founded in 1917 by Catholic priest Father Jorge Dintilhac SS.CC as Peru's first non-profit private institution of higher learning. Academically, PUCP ranks alternatively as first or second in Peru. In July 2012, after an Apostolic Visitation, begun earlier, in 2011, by Cardinal Peter Erdo, Archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest, Hungary, the Holy See withdrew from the university the right under canon law to use the titles Catholic and Pontifical in its name, but it was not possible because the legitimate law was the Peruvian Law. However, on Monday, April 28, 2014, the Rector of the University stated that,: \\"The Holy Father, Pope Francis, has formed a Commission of Cardinals with the mission of meeting to find a 'final, consensual solution,' in the framework of the Apostolic Constitution 'Ex Corde Ecclesiae,' ('From the Heart of the Church') to the outstanding issues\\" between the Vatican and the University.\\" Besides Cardinal Erdo, the other two Cardinal Members of the Commission will be Cardinal Gerald Cyprien Lacroix, Archbishop of Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, and Cardinal Ricardo Ezzati Andrello, Archbishop of Santiago de Chile, Chile. The University began activities in 1917 with two schools: Letters and Laws. In 1933, when the university had more than 500 students, the Schools of Engineering, and Political and Economical Sciences were established. In 1935, the School of Education was created. Later, in 1939, the Academy of Catholic Art was founded, with Adolf Winternitz as its director; the university is still one of only a small number to offer an arts major in Per√∫. During the 1960s, Gustavo Guti√©rrez O.P., a Peruvian priest and an instructor at the university, developed the first principles of \\"Liberation Theology\\", promoting Marxist socialism and pan-Latin American solidarity. There are currently 16,000 undergraduate students pursuing 38 different specialties in 10 schools. Its main campus is located in the Lima district of San Miguel, with the newly built Mac Gregor complex. Outside the main campus there are other facilities such as the IC (Idiomas Cat√≥lica), a language- learning center, the Confucius Institute PUCP, the cultural center (CCPUCP) located in the district of San Isidro. CENTRUM, a center for business studies featuring doctoral level and MBA programs and located in the district of Santiago de Surco, is also part of PUCP. Inside, there is a Pastoral Counseling Center (CAPU). The Student body is made up of 17,064 Undergraduates and 4,917 Postgraduates and 57 Doctoral students as of 2013, 1014 school year. = Uruguay = Education in Uruguay is compulsory for a total of nine years, beginning at the primary level, and is free from the pre-primary through the university level.\\"Uruguay\\" .

Primary school attendance rates were unavailable for Uruguay as of 2001. There are three levels of postsecondary education: * Tertiary Education level: 1 to 4 years degrees related to technical professions like Teachers, Professorship (Instituto de Profesores Artigas (IPA)), Technicians and Technologists (CETP, ex-UTU). * University level: 4 to 7 years Professional education taught at Universities such as the University of the Republic (Uruguay) () and various private universities offering many different degrees like Licentiate, Engineering degree, Medicine degree, various Law degrees, etc. * Post-graduate level: This is a specialized and research-oriented education level. It is divided in three levels: Specialist degree for both tertiary and university graduates, meanwhile master's degrees (both professional and academic oriented) and Doctorates are for graduated university students. The University of the Republic (Uruguay), (abbreviated UdelaR) is Uruguay's only public, state-owned university. It is the most important, oldest, and largest university in the country, with a student body of more than 130,000 students. It was founded on July 18, 1849 in Montevideo, where most of its buildings and facilities are still located. Its current Rector is Rodrigo Arim. The process of founding the country's public university began on June 11, 1833 when a law proposed by then-Senator D√°maso Antonio Larra√±aga was passed. It called for the creation of nine academic departments; the President of the Republic would pass a decree formally creating the departments once the majority of them were in operation. In 1836 the House of General Studies was formed, housing the departments of Latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology and jurisprudence. On May 27, 1838, Manuel Oribe passed a decree through which created the Greater University of the Republic. That decree had few practical effects, given the institutional instability of the Oriental Republic of the Uruguay at that time. The Universidad Cat√≥lica del Uruguay D√°maso Antonio Larra√±aga Universidad Cat√≥lica del Uruguay D√°maso Antonio Larra√±aga, Official Web Site is one of the many private universities in the country, and has seven schools: Humanities, Management, Law, Engineering and Technologies, Nursing, Dental School and Psychology.

A graduate of Harvard and Columbia, he studied under William James along with such prominent psychologists as Leta Stetter Hollingworth, James Rowland Angell, and Edward Thorndike. His textbook Psychology: A study of mental life, which appeared first in 1921, went through many editions and was the first introduction to psychology for generations of undergraduate students. His 1938 textbook of Experimental Psychology was scarcely less influential, especially in the 1954 second edition, written with Harold H. Schlosberg. He is known for introducing the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) formula of behavior. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Woodworth as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, James J. Gibson, David Rumelhart, Louis Leon Thurstone, and Margaret Floy Washburn. Early life Woodworth was born in Belchertown, Massachusetts on October 17, 1869. His father was a Congregationalist minister who had graduated from Yale College and Yale Divinity School, and his mother was a teacher who had graduated from Mount Holyoke College. Since Woodworth's mother was his father's third wife, he grew up in a large family with children from each of his father's marriages. His father's approach to parenting was authoritative and strict. He attended high school in Newton, Massachusetts with the plan of becoming a minister. He received his A.B. degree from Amherst College in 1891, focusing on religion, the classics, mathematics, science, and history. During his senior year, Woodworth took a class in psychology by Charles Edward Garman, which caused him to change his future plans. Rather than becoming a minister, he taught mathematics at a high school for two years and at a college for two years in Topeka, Kansas.Hothersall, D. (2004). History of Psychology. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. Following his stint as a teacher, Woodworth attended a lecture by G. Stanley Hall, and he was enthralled by Hall's emphasis on ‚Äúthe importance of discovery through investigation‚Äù (p. 374).Hothersall, D. (2004). History of Psychology. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. The lecture had such a profound effect on Woodworth that he hung a sign labeled ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù over his desk at home. He then read James's Principles of Psychology, and he had a similar captivating experience to many other students interested in psychology of the time. He decided then to finally follow a career path in psychology. In 1895, he returned to college as an undergraduate student at Harvard University, studying philosophy with Josiah Royce, psychology with William James, and history with George Santayana. Here at Harvard, he met Edward Lee Thorndike and Walter B. Cannon, and the three became longtime friends. While working with James, he encouraged Woodworth to keep a dream diary. The two were not able to find a significant correlation between the content of one's dreams and the day's events. However, Woodworth noted that he often dreamed about incomplete or interrupted topics and events, later emphasized by Bluma Zeigarnik with the Zeigarnik effect. In 1896, Woodworth earned his bachelor's degree from Harvard, followed by being an assistant at the Harvard Medical School in the physiology department from 1897-1898. Here, he observed Cannon's experiments on hunger and emotions. James McKeen Cattell offered Woodworth a graduate fellowship at Columbia University, one of the two primary functionalist schools in psychology. In 1899, Woodworth earned his PhD under Cattell. His dissertation was entitled \\"Accuracy of voluntary movement.\\" Academic lifeEarly research= Thorndike, who was now at Columbia, worked with Woodworth on the concept of transfer of training. These studies related to a significant issue of the time within education, as academics like James supported a ‚Äúdisciplinary subject‚Äù education under the assumption that the brain can be exercised. Many subjects like Latin were taught for their disciplinary value and not necessarily the subject matter. Woodworth and Thorndike empirically studied the benefits of a disciplinary education along with transfer of training and found no effect. However, as their contemporaries pointed out, they did not use a control group and, therefore, their studies had minimal value.Hothersall, D. (2004). History of Psychology. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. In 1902, Woodworth accepted a fellowship to work with Charles Sherrington at the University of Liverpool. Sherrington and Cattell both offered him a job afterwards, and Woodworth accepted Cattell's offer to study at Columbia, where he remained for the rest of his life. =Psychometrics= Woodworth followed in Cattell's footsteps in psychological testing and measurement. He first was in charge of a project where he tested about 1,100 people at the 1904 St. Louis Exposition. According to Hothersall, he took a ‚Äúremarkably sensible and fair-minded position on racial differences in test performance‚Äù (p. 376).Hothersall, D. (2004). History of Psychology. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. Woodworth emphasized that that labeling is based on alleged differences both internal (mental function and size) and external (skin color), making it difficult to compare them empirically. The characteristics are not equally measurable, and individual differences are very important, according to Woodworth, so experiments that claim to demonstrate sharp differences in races ignore overlap within a population. Additionally, Woodworth disagreed with the norm of the time with labeling civilizations as ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù or ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù because he noted that differences on the evolutionary time scale are likely minute to produce a mental status change. In 1906, the American Psychological Association appointed Woodworth as part of a committee to study psychometrics. With the onset of World War I, APA asked Woodworth to assist them in trying to prevent what was then known as ‚Äúshell shock‚Äù. He generated the Woodworth Personal Data Sheet (WPDS), which has been called the first personality test. It was a test of emotional stability to measure a soldier's susceptibility based on existing cases of the disorder. Although the test was designed too late for it to be used operationally, the test was highly influential in the development of later personality inventories with measures of neuroticism. Woodworth published Psychology: A study of mental life, which appeared first in 1921, and Experimental Psychology in 1938, which he worked on for nearly twenty years, and they became the definitive texts for thousands of psychology students. Additionally, Woodworth published Contemporary Schools of Psychology in 1932. He described the history of psychology according to a view that differing schools of psychology are complementary and not incompatible. This tolerant, open-minded view was likely a result of his unique perspective of psychology, being part of the subject for nearly the entire fifty years of its existence. He was renowned for this contribution, later being known as the dean of American Psychology. In 1914, Woodworth was elected president of APA, and in his presidential address, he discussed the question of the existence of imageless thoughts. He spent the summer of 1912 working in Oswald K√ºlpe‚Äôs lab studying the topic much to Titchener‚Äôs dismay. According to Titchener, imageless thoughts were not possible. Woodworth disagreed, stating that even if most thoughts have corresponding sensations and/or images, some do not. Woodworth was strongly opposed to ‚Äúepistemological tables of commandments‚Äù such as the strict and narrow approaches of Titchener and Watson, preferring a somewhat eclectic approach. =Motivational psychology= Woodworth introduced and popularized the expression Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) to describe his functionalist approach to psychology and to stress its difference from the strictly Stimulus-Response (S-R) approach of the behaviorists in his 1929 second edition of Psychology.Woodworth, Dynamic Psychology (1918) He later published the theory in Dynamic psychology (1918) and Dynamics of Behavior (1958). Within his modified S-O-R formula, Woodworth noted that the stimulus elicits a different effect or response depending on the state of the organism. The ‚ÄúO‚Äù (for organismic) mediates the relationship between the stimulus and the response. Woodworth advocated the creation of a technical vocabulary for psychology rather than only relying on often subjective operational definitions, but he was ignored by the community. He conveniently ignores the fact that he held very important and influential positions, such as being chairman of the National Research Council's Division of Anthropology and Psychology, in his autobiography. He only mentions his participation, demonstrating his modesty. In 1956, Woodworth was first recipient of the American Psychological Foundation gold medal for ‚ÄúDistinguished and continuous service to scholarship and research in psychology and for contributions to the growth of psychology though the medium of scientific publication‚Äù (p. 689)Poffenberger, A. T. (1962). Robert Sessions Woodworth, 1869-1962. American Journal of Psychology, 75, 677-689 A determined and persistent psychologist, Woodworth retired from Columbia at age 70, but he continued to lecture until age 89 and continued to write until age 91.

Its main constituents are oxygen (55.78%), silicon (21.76%), aluminium (20.90%), and hydrogen (1.56%). Halloysite typically forms by hydrothermal alteration of alumino-silicate minerals. It can occur intermixed with dickite, kaolinite, montmorillonite and other clay minerals. X-ray diffraction studies are required for positive identification. It was first described in 1826 and named after the Belgian geologist Omalius d'Halloy. Occurrence Electron micrograph of halloysite nanotubes. Halloysite nanotubes intercalated with ruthenium catalytic nanoparticles. The formation of halloysite is due to hydrothermal alteration, and it is often found near carbonate rocks. For example, halloysite samples found in Wagon Wheel Gap, Colorado, United States are suspected to be the weathering product of rhyolite by downward moving waters. In general the formation of clay minerals is highly favoured in tropical and sub-tropical climates due to the immense amounts of water flow. Halloysite has also been found overlaying basaltic rock, showing no gradual changes from rock to mineral formation. Halloysite occurs primarily in recently exposed volcanic-derived soils, but it also forms from primary minerals in tropical soils or pre-glacially weathered materials. Igneous rocks, especially glassy basaltic rocks are more susceptible to weathering and alteration forming halloysite. Often as is the case with halloysite found in Juab County, Utah, United States the clay is found in close association with goethite and limonite and often interspersed with alunite. Feldspars are also subject to decomposition by water saturated with carbon dioxide. When feldspar occurs near the surface of lava flows, the CO2 concentration is high, and reaction rates are rapid. With increasing depth, the leaching solutions become saturated with silica, aluminium, sodium, and calcium. Once the solutions are depleted of CO2 they precipitate as secondary minerals. The decomposition is dependent on the flow of water. In the case that halloysite is formed from plagioclase it will not pass through intermediate stages. One of the largest halloysite deposits in the world is Dunino, near Legnica in Poland. It has reserves estimated at 10 million tons of material. This halloysite is characterized by layered-tubular and platy structure. Structure Halloysite naturally occurs as small cylinders (nanotubes) that have a wall thickness of 10‚Äì15 atomic alumosilicate sheets, an outer diameter of 50‚Äì60 nm, an inner diameter of 12‚Äì15 nm, and a length of 0.5‚Äì10 Œºm. Their outer surface is mostly composed of SiO2 and the inner surface of Al2O3, and hence those surfaces are oppositely charged. Two common forms are found. When hydrated, the clay exhibits a 1 nm spacing of the layers, and when dehydrated (meta-halloysite), the spacing is 0.7 nm. The cation exchange capacity depends on the amount of hydration, as 2H2O has 5‚Äì10 meq/100 g, while 4H2O has 40‚Äì50 meq/100g. Endellite is the alternative name for the Al2Si2O5(OH)4¬∑2(H2O) structure.Endellite. Webminerals Owing to the layered structure of the halloysite, it has a large specific surface area, which can reach 117 m2/g. Applications Highly pure halloysite is mined from a rhyolite occurrence in New Zealand. Its uses include porcelain and bone china.CASE STUDY: Halloysite Clay. minerals.co.nzLyday, Travis Q. (2002) The Mineral Industry of New Zealand. minerals.usgs.gov Halloysite is an efficient adsorbent both for cations and anions. It has also been used as a petroleum cracking catalyst, and Exxon has developed a cracking catalyst based on synthetic halloysite in the 1970s. Owing to its structure, halloysite can be used as filler in either natural or modified forms in nanocomposites. Halloysite nanotube can be intercalated with catalytic metal nanoparticles made of silver, ruthenium, rhodium, platinum or cobalt, thereby serving as a catalyst support. Besides supporting nanoparticles, halloysite nanotubes can also be used as a template to produce round well-dispersed nanoparticles (NPs). For example, bismuth and bismuth subcarbonate NPs with controlled size (~7 nm) were synthesized in water. Importantly, when halloysite was not used, large nanoplates instead of round spheres are obtained.

Notable actors in the sector include Foxtel, Netflix and Stan. Regulation of the sector is assured by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. In 2012, prior to market entry of some major digital streaming services to Australia, only about 28% of Australian homes had a pay TV subscription, which was one of the lowest subscriber rates in the developed world. By 2019, the situation had evolved so that almost 14 million Australians had access to a paid television or video on demand service. History1990s= Galaxy was the first provider of subscription television in Australia, launching a MMDS service on 26 January 1995. Originally Premier Sports Network was the only local channel to be fully operational, with Showtime and Encore launching in March. They were later joined in April by TV1, Arena, Max, Red and Quest. A satellite service was launched later in the year. Optus Vision and Austar launched their cable services on 19 September followed by Foxtel on 22 October. Northgate Communications launched their service on 13 March 1997. It was later acquired by Neighbourhood Cable. Galaxy was closed on 20 May 1998. Two weeks later Foxtel significantly boosted its customer base by acquiring Galaxy subscribers from the liquidator of Australis Media and immediately commenced supplying programming to Galaxy's subscribers on an interim basis. In February 1999 Foxtel began offering its own satellite service to new customers. Following the collapse, ECTV quickly signed a deal with Optus Vision. Less than two months later, it was acquired by Austar, along with its stake in XYZ. Austar replaced the ECTV packages with their own in September. =2000s= TransTV launched in 2001, beginning with VoD followed later by linear channels. UBI World TV launched in 2004. Also in 2004, TV PLUS launched its Ethnic platforms catering for Balkans, Russians and other Eastern European communities. Foxtel and Austar both launched their digital offerings in 2004, with a total of 130 channels. The following year, Foxtel introduces their Foxtel iQ personal video recorder. SelecTV launched on 12 April 2006. It ceased its English programming in late 2010. Neighbourhood Cable with its hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) cable networks in three Victorian regional cities of Mildura, Ballarat and Geelong was acquired by TransACT at the end of 2007. In November 2011, TransACT was acquired by iiNet Limited, which in 2015 itself became a subsidiary of TPG. Foxtel commenced their HD service in February 2009. =2010s= Fetch TV entered the market in 2010 with a subscription service over a few ADSL2+ networks. =2020s=Channels available Almost all channels which currently or previously operated in Australia were available through Foxtel and Austar, being the dominant player in the market. However, some smaller competitors offer a subset of channels which are exclusive or unavailable on Foxtel services.

It is native to Russia, Central Asia and China, but the plant is probably better known in the western United States, where it is an introduced species and a notorious noxious weed.Forest Service Fire Ecology This annual herb is a hardy halophyte, thriving in soils far too saline to support many other plants. It also grows in alkali soils such as those on alkali flats and disturbed, barren habitat. It can be found in sagebrush and shadscale habitat, and it grows well in areas with cold winters.CDFA EncycloWeedia This plant produces a usually erect stem with several curving branches up to about 25 centimeters (10 in) tall. It has a taproot reaching up to half a meter deep in the soil and many lateral roots. The branches are lined with narrow, fleshy, blue-green leaves each up to about 2 centimeters long tipped with stiff bristles. The inflorescences are located all along the stem branches next to the leaves. Each inflorescence is a small cluster of tiny bisexual and female- only flowers accompanied by waxy bracts. The winged, membranous flowers surround the developing fruit, which is all that remains on the plant when it is ripe, the leaves and flower parts having fallen away. The fruit is a pale cylindrical utricle. The plant produces large amounts of seeds, which are dispersed by many vehicles, including human activity, animals (including ants), water flow, wind, and by being carried on the dry plant when it breaks off at ground level and rolls away as a tumbleweed. The seeds have the ability to germinate within one hour after being exposed to water. This herb is a pest on rangelands in the western United States. It has a high oxalate content, with up to 30% of the plant's dry weight made up of oxalate crystals, making it toxic to livestock that graze on it. It is especially toxic to sheep, which can be fatally poisoned by as little as twelve ounces (350 g) of the plant. Halogeton was first recognized as a danger to sheep in the 1940s after a rancher lost a herd of 160 sheep to poisoning.Flora of North America The oxalate causes acute hypocalcemia in the sheep, causing them to stagger, spasm, and finally die. Ingestion of a fatal dose of the plant can cause death in a sheep in under 12 hours. Ranchers often provide calcium-supplemented feed to sheep grazing on halogeton-infested land. Sheep are also able to adapt to halogeton in their diets over time, becoming sick from it less easily, and since it is hardly palatable they tend to avoid it in the first place when possible. Halogeton is also destructive to the land of the American west because its excretion of mineral salts makes it harder for other plants to grow where it occurs. The growth of the plant is controlled by introducing certain nonnative plants, such as immigrant kochia (Kochia prostrata) and crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), which compete successfully with halogeton. Grazing practices are changed to assure that land is not denuded, since land which is disturbed by overgrazing is susceptible to halogeton invasion.

In 1966, he and Gibson Vice President John Huis bought the Bigsby Electric Guitar Company. At Gibson he was involved in many guitar innovations and designs between 1950 and 1966.The Jerome and Dorothy Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation. Smithsonian Institution. \\"The Electric Guitar-Ted McCarty and Paul Reed Smith. Life and career Born in Somerset, Kentucky in 1909, McCarty earned a degree in engineering from the University of Cincinnati before joining the Wurlitzer Company in 1936. He stayed with Wurlitzer until 1948 when he was hired by Gibson. Brach's Candy also wanted to hire him. McCarty was named vice president of the Gibson Guitar Corporation in 1949, then president in 1950. He remained president until 1966. This period became known as Gibson's golden age of electric guitars. During his time with the company, the Gibson Les Paul was designed. McCarty sought to create a hybrid design that would combine the sustain of a solid-body electric guitar with the warmth of a hollow-body guitar. The ES-335 was created as a semi- hollow with a central block running the length of the guitar and hollow wings. McCarty was also responsible for the development of the Tune-o-matic bridge system, the humbucking pickup, and the Explorer, Flying V, Moderne, SG and Firebird guitars. Like Leo Fender, McCarty never played the guitar. He instead talked with every guitarist he could in order to find out what guitar players were interested in. In addition to his numerous inventions, he also is responsible for increasing Gibson's production from 5,000 guitars a year to more than 100,000. This increase in production allowed Gibson to grow from 150 employees to over 1,200 employees during McCarty's 18-year span as president. In 1966, McCarty retired from Gibson and became president of Bigsby Electric Guitars. In April 2000 McCarty became the first person interviewed for the National Association of Music Merchants Oral History program, a video collection of interviews with pioneers of the music industry. McCarty died in April 2001, at the age of 91. Collaboration McCarty became the mentor of Paul Reed Smith. Smith found out about McCarty during a visit to the US Patent office in the early 1980s, where he kept noticing McCarty's name among Gibson's patents. Smith later hired McCarty as a consultant, and credits his experience with McCarty as a defining moment in his company. In 1994, Paul Reed Smith's company PRS Guitars, launched the McCarty model as a tribute to McCarty. Previously, no instrument or company ever bore his name.

The division suffered heavy casualties in battles near ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and the remnants retreated to Warsaw, where they surrendered. The history of the division dates back to the autumn of 1921, when Polish Army changed its structure, after the victorious Polish-Soviet War. New unit was formed in Warsaw, out of three previously existing infantry regiments, and one light artillery regiment. The 15th Infantry Regiment, which had belonged to the 9th Infantry Division, was on August 19‚Äì21 transported by rail to Deblin, which became its peacetime garrison. The 36th Infantry Regiment, previously of the 8th Infantry Division, remained in Warsaw, and the 72nd Infantry Regiment (previously of the 18th Infantry Division was on October 7‚Äì8, 1921, transported from Brzesc nad Bugiem to Warsaw. Furthermore, the 28th Light Artillery Regiment, which had been formed on September 7, 1921 in Zambrow, was attached to the division and transported to Radom (Sept. 19-21, 1921). In 1921 - 1939, the 28th Division was part of the 1st Military District. In 1922, the 28th Light Artillery Regiment was moved from Radom to Zajezierze near Deblin, and in April 1922, the 72nd Infantry Regiment was transferred from Warsaw to Radom. In the 1939 German Invasion of Poland, the division, commanded by General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bo≈Ñcza-Uzdowski, belonged to Lodz Army. In the morning of September 1, 1939, it clashed with the advancing Wehrmacht near the villages of Lagiewniki and Raczyn, managing to halt the advance of the 1st Light Division. Due to repeated Luftwaffe attacks and artillery barrage, the unit suffered heavy losses, and was ordered to retreat behind the Warta river. On September 3, the division filled defensive positions behind the Warta and Widawa, near Wielun. Due to contradictory orders of General Boncza-Uzdowski, its 15th Infantry Regiment was almost completely destroyed, and had to be replaced by the 36th Regiment. Nevertheless, German 1st Light Division managed to break through Polish lines. As a result, the 36th and 72nd Regiments withdrew in the night of September 3/4 to the Widawka river, which was the main Polish defensive position in the area. On September 4, the 4th Infantry Regiment (from 2nd Legions Infantry Division) was sent there, to reinforce Polish units. On September 7, German 17th Infantry Division (General Herbert Loch) began its advance towards Pabianice. The town was defended by the recreated 15th Infantry Regiment, while the Germans were reinforced with SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler. The fighting in Pabianice was extremely bloody, with high losses on both sides. By the evening, the enemy reached the center of the town, but was quickly forced to flee. Meanwhile, however, the 2nd Legions Infantry Division, which was located north of Pabianice, retreated eastwards, forming a gap which the Germans immediately used. In the southern wing, the 72nd Infantry Regiment was almost completely destroyed. Under the circumstances, the division was ordered to regroup and abandon the area of Pabianice. During the retreat, the 15th Infantry Regiment clashed with the Germans near Ksawerow. The division was ordered to concentrate near Wola Cyrusowa, where on September 8, 1939, the Battle of Wola Cyrusowa took place. On September 9, General Wiktor Thommee ordered the division to retreat behind the Rawka river. On the next day, the order was changed and the division marched towards Warsaw, via Pruszkow. Despite initial successes, it failed to break through German positions. As a result, the division made an attempt to reach the fortress of Modlin. After entering the complex, it took part in the Battle of Modlin, until the capitulation on September 29. Commanders *gen.bryg.

Cohen graduated from Classical High School in Providence, Rhode Island. in 1959, and Brown University in 1963. He continued graduate education at Harvard University. From 1968 to 2008 he was the director of the Boston Camerata, a prominent American early music ensemble. He remains connected to the Boston Camerata as Music Director Emeritus. Cohen founded the Camerata Mediterranea in 1990 and incorporated it as a nonprofit research institute in France in 2007. He performs on lute and guitar and sings, but is best known as an organizer and creator of concert programs and sound recordings. He has also written extensively on musical topices. In recent years Cohen's research and performance activities have centered on early American repertoires (including Shaker song), as well as southern European repertoires of the Middle Ages. Many of his projects in this latter category involve collaboration with Middle Eastern musicians (see below). He has collaborated very frequently with his wife, French soprano Anne Az√©ma, the Artistic Director (since 2008) of the Boston Camerata, and has also worked with numerous choirs, including the Schola Cantorum and student choruses at Brown, Brandeis, Harvard and other universities. His professional honors include the Signet Society Medal (Harvard University), the Howard Mayer Brown Award, the Erwin Bodky Award, the Georges Longy Award, the Grand Prix du Disque (France) and the Edison Prize (Netherlands). He was a government-appointed artist-in-residence in the Netherlands during the year 2000, and is an Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres of the French Republic. Cohen studied composition with Randall Thompson at Harvard University, and musicology with Gustave Reese, Nino Pirotta, John Ward, and Elliot Forbes, at that same institution. He was awarded a Danforth Fellowship and spent two years in Paris as a student of Nadia Boulanger. In the 1970s he spent two seasons as a producer of musical radio programs for the French National Radio (France Musique), where he originated the concept of an all-day musical celebration on the days of the solstice, an idea later to be adapted as a national celebration each June 21 in France. This annual event is currently known as the \\"F√™te de la Musique\\" also known as \\"World Music Day\\". Work in European early music Cohen's initial projects in the early music field were in the area of the French and English Renaissance. His enthusiasm for medieval and Renaissance music continues to be reflected in recent projects, including a series of commissioned programs (2001‚Äì2008) for the Gardner Museum, Boston, around Italian repertoires of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. His forays into baroque repertoire have been more episodic but have attracted widespread comment and attention: the first early-instruments recording of Purcell's \\"Dido and Aeneas\\"(Harmonia Mundi, 1980), and a well-received recording of Jean Gilles' \\"Requiem\\" (Erato, 1990), among others. From 1986 forward, many of his new Eurocentric projects dealt with music of the Middle Ages, including a medieval retelling of the \\"Tristan and Iseult\\" legend (Erato, Grand Prix du Disque, 1987). Work in early American music Cohen's interest in American vernacular traditions dates from his childhood lessons on folk guitar, and his experience in later student years as a jazz bassist. He was introduced to southern shapenote tunebooks by his mentor at Harvard University, the composer Randall Thompson, and by Alan Lomax's field recordings of Sacred Harp sings in Alabama in 1942. Cohen later travelled to the South on several occasions to participate in Sacred Harp sings and conventions. His first program with the Boston Camerata involving extensive treatment of early American oral and written sources was \\"The Roots of American Music\\" (1976), released as an Advent cassette, and later re-recorded (1986) as \\"New Britain\\". The commercial success of this last recording, released after a lapse of several years by the French label Erato, leads Cohen and the Erato label to record a series of early American programs with the Boston Camerata, including \\"The American Vocalist\\", \\"Trav'ling Home\\", and \\"Liberty Tree\\". For the 1992 celebration of the Columbus year, the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Tanglewood Festival invite Cohen and the Camerata to prepare a program of early Hispanic repertoire from the New World. This project becomes \\"Nueva Espa√±a\\", recorded by Erato and subsequently one of the Boston Camerata's most requested touring programs. Cohen, the Boston Camerata, and the Shakers Informed by Shaker music scholar, Roger Hall, of the Shaker library at Sabbathday Lake, Maine, and its extensive musical holdings, Cohen traveled to that still-functioning religious community to do research on Shaker manuscript sources. He and his wife, soprano Anne Az√©ma, also began an enduring personal relationship with the members of the community, who agreed to record and perform their music in the company of the Boston Camerata and collaborating choirs. Two CDs of Shaker song (Simple Gifts and The Golden Harvest) commemorate these collaborations, which continued for several seasons from 1992 forward. In 2004 Cohen and the Finnish choreographer Tero Saarinen created a dance piece, \\"Borrowed Light\\", using live Shaker music. This production has toured extensively in France, Germany, England, Sweden, Finland, Italy, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Australia, and the United States, most recently at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival (Becket, Ma.) in 2012 and the Palais de Chaillot (Paris) in 2014. Cohen co-directed and edited the music for \\"A Chair fit for an Angel\\" (2014) a Canadian documentary film, winner of several awards, built around Shaker and Shaker-related arts. Intercultural musical activities Cohen's interest in cross-cultural and intercultural musical encounters have led to projects exploring early African and Amerindian contributions to New World music (\\"Nueva Espa√±a\\", cited above), and to several endeavors with Middle Eastern/Near Eastern artists. As early as 1982, Joel and the Boston Camerata had developed a program called \\"The Sacred Bridge,\\" exploring Jewish and Christian interactions during the Middle Ages. In 1988 Erato Disques decided to make a recording of this program. Still in demand after more than two decades, the recording has been reissued on Warner Classics. The \\"Sacred Bridge\\" program continues to tour internationally. Since its inception it has undergone considerable development, and now includes an important Arabic/Muslim component. Recent performances have been undertaken with the U.S.- based Sharq Arabic Music Ensemble In 1997 Joel Cohen met the eminent Moroccan musician Mohammed Briouel for the first time. Their encounter gave birth to a major production, a selection of the thirteenth century Cantigas of King Alfonso el Sabio with European and Moroccan musicians collaborating. The recording, made in Fez, Morocco, was signed \\"Camerata Mediterranea,\\" and included the participation of the Abdelkrim Rais orchestra of Fez, directed by Mr. Briouel. The Cantigas recording won the coveted Edison Prize in 2000, and has toured extensively in the United States, Morocco, Germany, the Netherlands, and France. \\"A Mediterranean Christmas\\", with the Boston Camerata and the Sharq Ensemble, is Cohen's most recent production exploring shared roots and musical practices. Recorded in 2005 for Warner Classics, and enthusiastically greeted by the musical press, the production has also toured live in the United States and France. In recent seasons Joel Cohen has also undertaken collaborations with D√ºnya, a Turkish music ensemble, and its leader, Mehmet Ali Sanlƒ±kol. With Camerata Mediterranea, he produced a colloquium in early summer 2009 around the subject of cross-cultural Mediterranean musical interactions, in the French village of Saint-Guilhem-le- D√©sert.

She said \\"My decision not to run was about my children and their future, and being the right kind of mom for them.\\" = Campaign finance = In 2002, Moua spent $45,852 on her campaign, including $11,200 in campaign matching funds. Her opponent in the 2002 race for MN Senate district 67, David Racer (R), received matching funds in the amount of $7,706. In order to receive matching funds a candidate must also raise a specified amount in individual contributions and agree to campaign spending limits. Moua received individual donor contributions in the amount of $21,599 in 2006. In 2006 she only had a single donor who contributed the $500 maximum under Minnesota campaign finance laws. The majority, $18,899 of her $21,599 in individual contributions, were from individual contributors donating $100 or less. She received matching funds in the amount of $15,794. Her Republican challenger, Richard Mulkern, received $9,982 in matching funds. = Per diem criticism = In 2008, Minnesota public records indicated that Moua claimed $21,954 in per diem, the most of any senator, and effectively increased her compensation by 71 percent. In response to Moua leading the senate with her per diem claims, Republican Senator Dick Day stated \\"I don't know how someone like Sen. Moua who lives a few miles from the Capitol can justify to her constituents spending taxpayer dollars so recklessly.\\" A study looking at per diem claims from 2009‚Äì10, Moua topped the list at $35,136. Also in 2010, CBS News noted that Moua as the top per diem taker.  Personal  She is married to Yee Chang, with whom she has three children.

Each division of SWAT is managed independently from state-to-state. The first SWAT group was established in Florida schools in 1998. In 1997, the state of Florida settled a lawsuit against tobacco companies for 11.3 billion dollars (later increased to over 13 billion dollars through a friendly language clause) to be paid out over the next 25 years. The then governor Lawton Chiles directed money won in the settlement to fund a state program to prevent youth smoking. Out of these funds came SWAT; From 1998 to 2003, youth smoking decreased by more than 50% among Florida youth in grades 6-12 . SWAT continues its operations in Florida under the guidance of four Regional Tobacco Prevention Coordinators. Florida received another tobacco settlement in 2005 and on November 7, 2006, Floridians voted to pass Amendment 4 requiring 15% ($57 million) of the settlement to be used to fund a statewide tobacco education and prevention program. This funding has been made available to individual counties to be spent at their discretion. The Centers for Disease control have not recognized youth-led tobacco prevention efforts as valid . According to Tina Rosenberg, on pages 66-82 of her book \\"Join the Club,\\" the information about tobacco-industry propaganda and manipulation of youth [such as the Joe Camel ad campaign] to get them hooked on tobacco was the most effective PR tool in Florida's SWAT campaign. She goes on to describe how SWAT was gradually defanged after Jeb Bush became governor and the legislature began to cut funding. The current campaign, managed by Florida's Dept. of Health, uses only the information that has been found to be less effective in reducing teen smoking. On page 75, Rosenberg describes research by RTI International showing that only 2 beliefs actually correlate with lower teen smoking: 1) cigarette companies lie, and 2) cigarette companies try to get youth to start smoking. On page 78, she notes that the \\"tobacco industry gave its approval to themes of addictiveness, health effects, and social costs because they were the proven failures. The states probably agreed to them at the time [of the Master Settlement Agreement] because they didn't know better.\\" Other such programs exist, though sometimes with a variation in name, in states including Michigan, New York and Oklahoma.

It is the campus radio station of the city's Glendon College, a campus of York University. Radio Glendon offers a variety of programs in both English and French, and the programming schedule features both independent and mainstream music. The station has broadcast on a variety of platforms since its creation in 1977. Originally a cable radio outlet, it converted to AM radio in 1990, and then to FM radio in 2005, with the call sign CKRG-FM, before ceasing its conventional radio transmissions and moving exclusively online in 2010. Early historyFirst iteration: FM cable, 1977-1980= CKRG broadcast on FM started with a 'cable only' license from May 23, 1977 to August 15, 1980. Alan Lysaght was the manager during this time. By January 1978 RGL had 2 new 'on-air' studios in the Glendon mansion, one of which fed the pub and Junior Common room, the other licensed studio fed a low power transmitter which covered the campus and a Rogers and Metro Cable for transmission throughout Toronto on Cable FM. In March 1979, CKRG was seeking funding for a full FM license not restricted to cable FM. In January, 1980 an article The Globe and Mail detailed some of the station's programming: > It's Mozart, followed by Elvis Costello, followed by Haitian Voodoo music, > followed by contemporary music from a staggering variety of relatively > unknown Canadian artists such as Array, the Canadian Contemporary Music > Ensemble, the Glass Orchestra and Honey Novick. It's unknown Canadian poetry > and drama, lectures, arts reviews, and live broadcasts from out of the way > places like Toronto's Music Gallery....while the station is officially off > the air (at night), the outside microphone (lodged on the roof of the > station's home in a mansion at Glendon College) picks up the nightly > warblings from the winged creatures congregating in the valley and transmits > them to all who listen... In November 1981, Pro Tem published an article entitled, \\"The CKRG Story\\", stating that funding stopped in August 1980, the station stopped broadcasting and that the station's broadcast equipment was moved out of the Glendon Hall studios for safekeeping until funding for the license could be secured. The funding never came and the equipment was donated to non-profit broadcasters. The station went off the air for a period of 5 years. =Second iteration: Glendon in-house radio, 1985-1990= By 1985, CKRG was piped into the cafeteria and student lounge using extremely long speaker wires strung through conduit from the basement of the Glendon mansion to the physical plant building and finally connecting into ceiling loudspeakers, as well as a line in the pub also located in the basement of the Glendon mansion. For the next three years CKRG did mostly college DJ dance events using a combination of owned and rented DJ equipment in the pub and cafeteria. =Third iteration: 800 AM, 1990-2005= In 1989, station manager Stefan Caunter, who had started in 1985 on the staff of the station, felt that the time had come to re-acquire a license, to provide real radio transmission to Glendon using mostly existing carrier current equipment. In 1990, CKRG was given approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to broadcast at AM 800 kHz with the transmitter power of 25 watts. Note that the company which was to be incorporated, Bayview Avenue Non-Profit Student Radio, was incorporated by Caunter in 1990, and was the license holder for the FM 89.9 license. In 1991, station manager Derek Allerton began to rebuild the station and put forth a serious effort to re-acquire an FM license, to broadcast at 200 watts on 106.3 MHz, to replace the existing AM carrier-current license (the signal was transmitted through the campus electrical system, rather than through the air) the station ran on. By 1993 the Toronto radio market had become saturated, and competition for the remaining broadcast frequencies was fierce. The CRTC denied the application in 1994. Broadcast equipment was largely obsolete and in a state of series disrepair by 1991. Allerton contacted various commercial and public radio stations in the Toronto area and requested any unused equipment be donated. Only the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation replied but was able to provide a substantial amount of equipment, including reel-to-reel machines and equipment racks. After Allerton's exit as a manager, and throughout much of the 1990s, the station focused on broadcasting to its core audience, the students of Glendon College. One notable exception was Edward Beres, who as manager was able to expand the station's facilities to include a dedicated broadcast booth beside the student pub. Due to the CRTC's 1994 denial, he also elected to add a second AM transmitter (on the same frequency) and moved one transmitter to each residence building. During Ed Beres' term as a manager, he managed to recruit some very dedicated volunteers to carry on the station's day-to-day functions. New students would be attracted to the radio station, and its new and improved broadcast range into the residence buildings, cafeteria, and pub. Volunteers such as Richie Favalaro (now with major Toronto radio station CHUM-FM), Mike Glustien (now with Ottawa's CFGO) Mike Shering, David Taillefer, and Philip Godin took on the responsibilities of such tasks as the financial needs of the station, programming, music tracking, and recruiting of new student's as on- air DJs. Ed updated the broadcast equipment and made the station more accessible for student clubs to use for special event planning. Ed's successor as a manager in 1995, Philip Godin, continued to create an accessible student radio station by promoting throughout the campus, hosting events for the new students during orientation week, and ensuring there was a regular broadcast schedule from 8 am to noon. Godin wanted to improve the infrastructure of the radio station from the ground up, to prove to the CRTC that CKRG could be capable of broadcasting on the FM frequency once again. As well as ensuring a solid broadcast schedule for students at Glendon, Godin started a co-op training program at CKRG which allowed local high schools in the area to teach students the basics in radio broadcasting. Godin also brought on Alison Smith as News Director in 1995, and later Anthony Burnett in 1996 as Assistant News Director to round out the station's executive, fleshing out a full broadcast schedule by the end of 1997. In 1998, the station manager Brad Crowe took a decisive step in building up the radio station's listenership and purchased a 1-watt transmitter which was capable of broadcasting to the campus. From 1998-2001, former Office Manager and transplant from CKLU in Sudbury, Ontario, Ryan LaFlamme continued Brad's work as Station Manager. Accomplishments included increasing volunteer number to over 85 undergraduate students and creating the first complete programming schedule in many years, obtaining an LPFM license, rebuilding the secondary production and interview room, finalizing the re-cataloging of the music library, and restoring the 'vinyl vault' from storage for run-down equipment. Ryan was responsible for training several of the future station executive and Station Managers, including Seth Wotten. Beginning in 2002, the live streaming of radio broadcasts allowed much wider audiences access to the station. Student DJ's were encouraged to incorporate new technology into their broadcasts. Previously it was common to see a DJ carrying a record crate or CD suitcase for their shows, but the sight of laptops became more common. Several up-and-coming dance music DJ's also graced the broadcast booth, including a then-unknown Toronto trance DJ named Joyrider, and Jonathan Swayze, a successful electronica DJ. =Fourth iteration: 89.9 FM, 2005-2010= In September 2004, the CRTC approved a licence for CKRG to broadcast on 89.9 FM, expiring August 31, 2011. The station signed on in 2005. The broadcast signal ran for 5 years, but was fairly weak, with the signal often unlistenable south of St. Clair Avenue. The decision was made to discontinue the CKRG FM license in light of improved internet technology and the impending expiration of the license in 2011. The FM station went dark in 2010, although the CRTC actually renewed the FM license through 2013. =Current iteration: Online, 2010-present= The online station essentially replaced the over-the-air broadcast station and was up and running in 2010. However, it suffered much initial difficulty maintaining the quality of its online stream, and after long periods of neglect, was eventually abandoned. After nearly a year of inactivity, Radio Glendon moved to a new website at www.radioglendon.ca in 2011, with the site's official launch party being held on October 21. The station's new website had a revamped layout, and included member and DJ profiles and schedules, and the broadcast booth was renovated. Radio Glendon began broadcasting soon after the launch party, with live shows airing from November 7, 2011 until the end of the school year in early April 2012. The station now broadcasts mainly during the school year. Since this period, Station Managers included Stephanie Henry, now a Breakfast Television Traffic Reporter, and Simone Visentin, a production assistant at TLN Media Group.

Raised from recruits in the area of Wo≈Çy≈Ñ, the division was posted to the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Army. During several desperate counter-attacks, the brigade suffered heavy casualties near ≈Å√≥d≈∫. It was commanded by Colonel Julian Filipowicz. Most notably, the unit took part in one of the first battles of the German invasion of Poland (and thus, World War II), the battle of Mokra. Wo≈Çy≈Ñska BK w 1938 History The Vohlynian Cavalry Brigade was formed on April 1, 1937, out of sub-units of the R√≥wne Cavalry Brigade, and several smaller detachments. Formed out of recruits from the region of Volhynia, the brigade was decentralized and its units stationed in several towns from the region, including R√≥wne, Dubno, Bia≈Çokrynica and Ostr√≥g by the Hory≈Ñ. As part of the first wave of the Polish Army, the brigade was fully mobilized prior to the outbreak of World War II, and transported to the area of ≈Å√≥d≈∫. In accordance with the Polish mobilization scheme, the brigade was attached to Wiktor Thomm√©es, Piotrk√≥w Operational Group, of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Army. The brigade was to form that unit's mobile reserve and cover the planned retreat of the 7th Infantry Division. After the beginning of the Invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, the unit took part in the battle of Mokra, where it held its ground although with heavy losses. The brigade withdrew towards the east, and the following day defended the second line of defense near Ostrowy, where it suffered further casualties. On 2 Sept., the brigade held up the 4th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht).Zaloga, S.J., 2002, Poland 1939, Oxford: Osprey Publishing Ltd., On September 3, it reached the main line of defense of the Army along the Warta-Widawka line (≈Åƒôki≈Ñsko-≈Åƒôkawa-Jan√≥w). With its flanks covered from both sides, the 2nd Mounted Rifles Regiment made a successful sortie towards the village of Kamie≈Ñsk, on September 4, where it surprised the German 4th Panzer Division, and destroyed several of its tanks and a dozen of its fuel tanks, killing approximately 100 enemy soldiers. The following day, the entire brigade took part in a sortie towards the village of Wola Krzysztoporska and Je≈º√≥w, but were forced back after a German counter-attack. On September 7, 1939, the German forces finally managed to break through the lines of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Army and the brigade was forced to retreat after a skirmish against the German 18th Infantry Division near the villages of Zamo≈õƒá and ≈ªeromin, both near the town of Tuszyn. Withdrawing towards Andrespol, on September 8, the unit entered the battle of Wola Cyrusowa, where it covered the western and northern flanks of the entire army, withdrawing eastwards. The result of the day-long battle against the German 10th Infantry Division, was that the Volhynian Brigade suffered significant losses. As the sun set, the Poles withdrew to the other side of the Mroga river and then towards Chleb√≥w, where it spent the several hours to reorganize. Due to the fast pace of German armoured assault, the brigade had to retreat further eastwards and on September 10, it reached the Kampinos Forest through Miedniewice, Szyman√≥w and Kampinos. The brigade spent the following two days in the forests halfway between Warsaw and Modlin. It was joined by the retreating Nowogr√≥dzka Cavalry Brigade, and received some reinforcements, although it was already in bad shape. By September 13, both units started a counter-assault in the direction of the town of Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki. By now the brigade, was reduced to less than 50% of its original strength, but managed to retake the village of Cyganka, and continue its counter offensive towards Choszcz√≥wka, but a German counter- attack broke its momentum and forced them to retreat. After the battle, the brigade ceased to exist as an organized force. The 21st Uhlan Regiment and the remnants of the 12th withdrew to Warsaw, where they fought in the defense of Warsaw until September 28, in the ranks of Roman Abraham's Combined Cavalry Brigade. The remaining forces of the brigade joined the forces of General Stefan DƒÖb-Biernacki's Northern Front and withdrew further eastwards, towards the Bug River. On September 22, near Sok√≥≈Çka they took part in the battle of Suchowola against the German 68th Infantry Division, and then in the battles of Krasnobr√≥d and Huta R√≥≈ºaniecka.

The school was founded on December 6, 1759, by a group of prominent Germantown citizens in the Green Tree Tavern on the Germantown Road. Germantown Academy enrolls students from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade and is located in the Philadelphia suburb of Fort Washington, having moved from its original Germantown campus in 1965. The original campus (see Old Germantown Academy and Headmasters' Houses) is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The school shares the oldest continuous high school football rivalry with the William Penn Charter School. HistoryEarly years= The Union School was founded on the evening of December 6, 1759, at the Green Tree Tavern on Germantown Avenue. The school was founded by prominent members of the Germantown community who wished to provide a country school for their children. As some of the founders and residents of Germantown were of German descent, it was decided that the school be opened with both English and German speaking departments. The founders chose David James Dove to head the English department and Hilarius Becker of Bernheim, Germany, to head the German school. In 1761, land was given to the school by trustee Charles Bensell, and a schoolhouse with its iconic belfry was constructed. The school found itself in the crossroads of early American history. In 1777, the Battle of Germantown was fought on the front lawn of trustee Benjamin Chew at his home Cliveden less than a mile from campus. During the American Revolution, the school served as a hospital and camp for British soldiers. Legend says that the British officers played the first game of cricket in America on the Academy's front lawn. After the war, the school was visited by President George Washington. Washington sent his adopted step-grandson George Washington Parke Custis to the Academy during the 1793 yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia. The school was visited by the Marquis de Lafayette on his 1825 visit to America and hosted Fernando, the adopted son of South American liberator Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. In 1830, Amos Bronson Alcott, father of Louisa May Alcott, was appointed headmaster and attempts were made to co-educate the school but were quickly abandoned.A History of the Germantown Academy, 1760‚Äì1910, Lippincott, H.M., Burbank, 1910 =The Kershaw years= After the Civil War, the school was in decline, with a small student body and outdated facilities. In 1877, Dr. William Kershaw was appointed headmaster. Under his leadership, the Academy gained prominence and expanded its activities with the introduction of the Inter-Academic League (1887), The Belfry Club, one of the oldest high school drama clubs in the country (1894), and The Academy Monthly (1885), one of the oldest student literary magazines still in existence. During his headmastership, GA graduated a future University of Pennsylvania president, a Supreme Court justice, and a primate of the Episcopal Church. =20th century= In 1915, Dr. Kershaw retired and Dr. Samuel E. Osbourn was appointed headmaster. Under Dr. Osbourn's leadership, the school increased in size, focused on scholarship and continued to produce some of Philadelphia's finest citizens. Under Osbourn, GA established the eighth oldest Cum Laude Society chapter in the nation and started an endowment. After the World Wars, GA was led by headmaster Donald Miller who was instrumental in the move from Germantown to the current Fort Washington campus. By the 1960s, GA families had left Germantown for nearby suburbs. In five years, \\"The Miracle of Fort Washington\\" (a term coined by Judge Jerome O'Neill, '28) occurred as the school moved from city to suburb. In this transition, GA coeducated, accepting girls in 1961 with the first co-ed class graduating in 1968.A History of the Germantown Academy, Vol. II 1877‚Äì1936, Lippincott, H.M.,1935 Traditions and symbols A view of the original Germantown campus, 1954 The school colors are red, black, and blue. Originally, red, white, and blue, the white was changed to black upon the death of Abraham Lincoln in 1865. Another legend suggests that GA changed its colors so its cricket team would not be confused with the nearby Philadelphia Cricket Club (with red, black, and yellow as club colors) team, as the white would turn to yellow after long and hot matches. GA/PC Day is an annual tradition where GA plays against its rival William Penn Charter School in football, soccer, field hockey, cross country, girls' tennis, water polo, and golf. The football game brings alumni back from both schools and reunions are held the weekend of the games. The competition is the oldest of its kind dating back to 1886. Lower School Field Day is an annual tradition that brings the red and blue teams into fierce competition. The teams are generational for existing GA families and is a staple to the school spring calendar. The Belfry serves as a symbol of the old and new school as both buildings in Germantown and Fort Washington had identical structures. It is the namesake for the drama club and is used as symbol on GA items. Lower School A view of McLean Hall shortly after its construction in 1965 The Lower School consists of three main buildings: Leas Hall, McLean Hall (constructed in 1964), and the Abramson Lower School (constructed in 1999). Leas Hall comprises the Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten classrooms, while McLean Hall contains 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade classrooms. The Abramson Lower School has two 3rd grade classrooms, science rooms, and music classrooms. There are currently 347 students enrolled in the Lower School (as of the 2019-20 school year), and a student-to-teacher ratio of 14:1. Middle school The Middle School as a separate department was established in 1976. It was first led by Barbara Hitschler Serrill,'68 and then run by longtime Head of Middle School, Richard House. The first Alter Middle School was donated by Dennis and Gisela Alter and constructed in 1997. In 2011, the new Alter Middle School was constructed and opened as a part of the Building on Tradition campus campaign. There are many activities for students, such as the science fair, a play and musical, sports teams, many clubs, such as a Fandom Club, an art club, and a literary magazine. There are 275 students currently enrolled in the Middle school (as of the 2019-20 school year). Upper School Students are required at minimum, five credits per year and at least four years of English, three years of Math, Science, History, two years of Language, and one year of Art. There are 567 students enrolled in the Upper School (as of the 2019-20 school year). The student to teacher ratio is currently 8:1 in the Upper School. The upper school runs on a house system. Each student is placed into one of seven houses. These houses include, Alcott Day, Washington, Galloway, Osbourn, Kershaw, Truesdell, and Roberts. Each house is named after an important figure with a Germantown Academy connection. A student will stay with their house for all four years of upper school life. Each house has a house head, these teachers include, Robert Torrey, Rebecca Pizzino, Reed Skoug, David Martin, Susan Merrill, Jason Straub, and Chidi Asoluka. Over the course of a year, each house will meet twice a week, and for special events, they will compete against each other. These special events include The Knowledge Bowl House Olympics and The Annual Spelling Bee. Each year a house cup is crowned to the house with the most house points which are picked up throughout the year in the challenges above and in many others. This year (2014‚Äì2015) the Upper School is run by Rich Schellhas who is the recent head elect, Schellhas will begin his tenure in 2016. Schellhas is aided by Chris Nelson who serves as the \\"head of upper school figure\\" when Schellhas is not present. Currently, The Upper School is searching for another head. Conduct in the upper school is governed by the Honor Code, a system where students agree to a set of rules, and where, in the case of an infraction, students are judged by an honor council consisting of teachers and peers. A view of the Middle and Upper Schools after their rebuilding in 2011 =Upper School publications= * The Academy Monthly is one of the oldest student run literary magazines in the country, founded in 1884. Published biannually. Features student and faculty writing and artwork. * The Edition is the Upper School newspaper was founded in 1969. It includes editorials, school news and sports updates as well as commentary on contemporary culture. * Frequency: Frequency magazine provides insight into contemporary music scene through editorials, CD reviews, news about upcoming concerts and album release dates. Students and staff are encouraged to submit material. * maGAzine: maGAzine is the Upper School current events/political journal. It includes political commentary, articles and artwork by students and staff. * Voyager: The Upper School's Modern Language Journal features articles on world cultures and language. Includes observations, poetry, travel writing and artwork by students and staff. * Ye Primer: First published in 1895 as a record of the senior class, the yearbook has expanded to include the whole school, captures the life of the student body, faculty and staff with pictures, articles and senior pages. =Upper School clubs= * Academy Club (student/alumni liaison group) * Academy Monthly (student literary magazine) * ACT Club (All Cultures Together) * Apiary Club * Art Club * ASIA (Asian Students in America) * Beatles Appreciation Club * Belfry Club (drama club) * Book Club * BSA (Black Student Alliance) * Cappies (student reviews of student theater productions) * Celtic League * Chess Club * Community Partnership School/Project Home Tutoring * CSO (Community Service Organization) * Documentary Club * Edition (GA newspaper) * Ethics Club (discussions of issues relevant to students) * Fashion Club * Film Club (view and discuss classics and contemporary films) * Finance Club * FOCUS (nondenominational Bible study) * Food Club * Frequency (music club) * GAAC (GA Aquatic Club) * GAEA (GA Environmental Action) * Garden to Market Entrepreneurs * GA TV Club * GLASS (Gay Lesbian and Straight Students) * Green Gardeners * Hip Hop Culture Club * Indian Culture Club * Jazz Ensemble * Jewish Culture Club * KTK Club (Kids Teaching Kids Science) * Math Club * Mock Trial * Model UN * National Science Honors Society * Outdoor Club * Patriot Ambassadors (student tour guides) * Patriot (Spirit) Club * Philly Sports Club * Quizbowl (trivia and general knowledge competition team) * Relay for Life * GA-PC Student Coalition * SCUBA Club * SGA (Student Government Association) * Small Metals Club * Stage Crew (theater production technical crew) * Student Tutoring * Voyager (modern language journal) * Women's Forum (discussion of relevant women's issues) * Ye Primer (yearbook) =House system= The house system was established in 2007 at the insistence of Headmaster Jim Connor and Upper School faculty member Ted Haynie. The seven-house system is modeled after the ancient English public school concept of joining students from different years in a common group. Each of the seven houses is named for an influential alumnus or friend of the academy. Each house consists of roughly 80 people and competes in various competitions throughout the year. The system also provides an academic and social support system for underclassmen as they have the chance to interact with upperclassmen and a variety of faculty. Each house is run by a House Head and two student prefects (one boy, one girl). Throughout the year, the houses compete in various competitions ranging from a Knowledge Bowl to a German Folk Song Singing Contest to Handball, etc. The highpoint of the house system calendar is the House Olympics which is held in early May where the different houses compete in athletic and academic competitions for a chance of the House Olympics Trophy (in parenthesis is the faculty house head for the 2017‚Äì18 school year) Washington is named for President George Washington, a patron of the old school and a parent as his step-son George Washington Parke Custis attended in the 1790s. The house colors are black and silver and Washington himself serves as the house mascot. (Jason Straub) Alcott Day (previously known as just Alcott until June 3, 2016) is named for former headmaster Amos Bronson Alcott, and longtime teacher Virginia Belle Day. Alcott, the father of renowned author Louisa May Alcott, believed strongly in providing girls with an education comparable to that given to boys, despite the fact that most educators of his day sought to emphasize a ‚Äòdomestic arts‚Äô curriculum for girls. He introduced coeducational integration for a brief period starting in 1831, before leaving the academy three years later. Virginia \\"Jinny\\" Day worked tirelessly to make the academy open to all, regardless of gender, in 1963. Alcott house colors are blue and green and its house mascot is the alligator. (Peggy Bradley) Roberts is named for Supreme Court Justice Owen J. Roberts, a member of the class of 1890. Roberts House colors are blue and orange and their mascot is the walrus. (Michael Torrey) Truesdell is named for longtime GA teacher, Walter Truesdell. Truesdell was Phi Beta Kappa and taught Latin for thirty years. The house colors are blue and silver and the mascot is the timberwolf. (Rachel Lingten) Kershaw is named for headmaster Dr. William Kershaw (1877‚Äì1915). Kershaw's colors are navy blue and light blue and the mascot is the kangaroo. (David Martin) Galloway is named for early Academy trustee Joseph Galloway, a notable Philadelphia figure during the Revolution. Galloway's house colors are black and yellow and their mascot is the Griffin. (Reed Skoug) Osbourn is named for longtime headmaster Dr. Samuel E. Osbourn (1915‚Äì1948). The house colors are green and white. (Susan Merrill) AdministrationAlma mater= The alma mater was written c. 1910 by J. Hefflestein Mason, a member of the class of 1900. Class songs originated as early as 1885 and appeared in each class's Ye Primer. Before the current alma mater, the school had a few lesser-known \\"alma maters\\" and a school yell which was sung after 1910. Before the 1970s, the alma mater was sung along with the school hymn Our God, Our Help in Ages Past. Mason went on to write more music and perform with the Philadelphia Opera Company.252 Years and Counting, A History of Germantown Academy, 1759‚Äì2011, Anderson, Kenneth S., Hoster, 2011 center =Headmasters= Donald H.

In particular, it is tied to the philosophy of German philosophers Karl-Otto Apel and J√ºrgen Habermas, and their program of universal pragmatics, along with its related theories such as those on discourse ethics and rational reconstruction. This view of reason is concerned with clarifying the norms and procedures by which agreement can be reached, and is therefore a view of reason as a form of public justification. According to the theory of communicative rationality, the potential for certain kinds of reason is inherent in communication itself. Building from this, Habermas has tried to formalize that potential in explicit terms. According to Habermas, the phenomena that need to be accounted for by the theory are the \\"intuitively mastered rules for reaching an understanding and conducting argumentation\\", possessed by subjects who are capable of speech and action. The goal is to transform this implicit \\"know-how\\" into explicit \\"know- that\\", i.e. knowledge, about how we conduct ourselves in the realm of \\"moral- practical\\" reasoning. The result of the theory is a conception of reason that Habermas sees as doing justice to the most important trends in twentieth century philosophy, while escaping the relativism which characterizes postmodernism, and also providing necessary standards for critical evaluation.Habermas 1992  Three kinds of (formal) reason  According to Habermas, the \\"substantive\\" (i.e. formally and semantically integrated) rationality that characterized pre-modern worldviews has, since modern times, been emptied of its content and divided into three purely \\"formal\\" realms: (1) cognitive-instrumental reason; (2) moral-practical reason; and (3) aesthetic- expressive reason. The first type applies to the sciences, where experimentation and theorizing are geared towards a need to predict and control outcomes. The second type is at play in our moral and political deliberations (very broadly, answers to the question \\"how should I live?\\"), and the third type is typically found in the practices of art and literature. It is the second type which concerns Habermas. Because of the de-centering of religion and other traditions that once played this role, according to Habermas we can no longer give substantive answers to the question \\"How should I live?\\" Additionally, there are strict limits which a \\"post-metaphysical\\" theory (see below) must respect ‚Äì namely the clarification of procedures and norms upon which our public deliberation depends. The modes of justification we use in our moral and political deliberations, and the ways we determine which claims of others are valid, are what matter most, and what determine whether we are being \\"rational\\". Hence the role that Habermas sees for communicative reason is formulating appropriate methods by which to conduct our moral and political discourse. This purely formal \\"division of labour\\" has been criticized by Nikolas Kompridis, who sees in it too strong a division between practical and aesthetic reasoning, an unjustifiably hard distinction between the \\"right\\" and the \\"good\\", and an unsupportable priority of validity to meaning.Kompridis 2006  Post-metaphysical philosophy  There are a number of specific trends that Habermas identifies as important to twentieth century philosophy, and to which he thinks his conception of communicative rationality contributes. To look at these trends is to give a clear outline of Habermas's understanding of communicative rationality. He labels all these trends as being post-metaphysical.Cooke 1994 These post-metaphysical philosophical movements have, among other things: # called into question the substantive conceptions of rationality (e.g. \\"a rational person thinks this\\") and put forward procedural or formal conceptions instead (e.g. \\"a rational person thinks like this\\"); # replaced foundationalism with fallibilism with regard to valid knowledge and how it may be achieved; # cast doubt on the idea that reason should be conceived abstractly beyond history and the complexities of social life, and have contextualized or situated reason in actual historical practices; # replaced a focus on individual structures of consciousness with a concern for pragmatic structures of language and action as part of the contextualization of reason; and # given up philosophy's traditional fixation on theoretical truth and the representational functions of language, to the extent that they also recognize the moral and expressive functions of language as part of the contextualization of reason.  Explanation  Habermas' conception of communicative rationality moves along with these contemporary currents of philosophy. Concerning (1) it can be said that: Concerning (2), Habermas clearly and explicitly understands communicative rationality according to the terms of a reconstructive science. This means that the conception of communicative rationality is not a definitive rendering of what reason is, but rather a fallible claim. It can prescribe only formal specifications concerning what qualifies as reasonable, being open to revision in cause of experience and learning. On (3) and (4), Habermas's entire conceptual framework is based on his understanding of social interaction and communicative practices, and he ties rationality to the validity basis of everyday speech. This framework locates reason in the everyday practices of modern individuals. This is in contradistinction to theories of rationality (e.g. Plato, Kant, etc.) that seek to ground reason in an intelligible and non-temporal realm, or objective \\"view from nowhere\\", which supposes that reason is able adequately to judge reality from a detached and disinterested perspective. While Habermas's notion of communicative rationality is contextualized and historicized, it is not relativistic. Many philosophical contextualists take reason to be entirely context-dependent and relative. Habermas holds reason to be relatively context specific and sensitive. The difference is that Habermas explicates the deep structures of reason by examining the presuppositions and validity dimensions of everyday communication, while the relativists focus only on the content displayed in various concrete standards of rationality. Thus, Habermas can compare and contrast the rationality of various forms of society with an eye to the deeper and more universal processes at work, which enables him to justify the critique of certain forms (i.e., that Nazism is irrational and bad) and lend support to the championing of others (i.e., democracy is rational and good). The relativists on the other hand can compare and contrast the rationality of various forms of society but are unable to take up a critical stance, because they can posit no standard of rationality outside the relative and variable content of the societies in question, which leads to absurd conclusions (i.e., that Nazism is morally equivalent to democracy because the standards for both are relative). = Validity dimensions = Concerning (5), Habermas's communicative rationality emphasizes the equal importance of the three validity dimensions, which means it sees the potential for rationality in normative rightness (WE), theoretical truth (IT) and expressive or subjective truthfulness (I). The differentiation of these three \\"worlds\\" is understood as a valuable heuristic. This leaves each to its specific forms of argumentation and justification. However, these validity dimensions should be related to one another and understood as complementary pieces in a broader conception of rationality. This points towards a productive interpenetration of the validity dimensions, for example the use of moral insights by the sciences without their having to sacrifice theoretical rigor, or the inclusion of psychological data into resources of moral philosophy. These last points concerning the breadth of communicative rationality have by far the most important implications. By differentiating the three validity dimensions and holding them as equally valuable and rational, a broader and multifaceted conception of rationality is opened. What this means is that Habermas has, through the formal pragmatic analysis of communication, revealed that rationality should not be limited to the consideration and resolution of objective concerns. He claims that the structure of communication itself demonstrates that normative and evaluative concerns can (and ought to) be resolved through rational procedures. The clearest way to see this is to recognize that the validity dimensions implicit in communication signify that a speaker is open to the charge of being irrational if they place normative validity claims outside of rational discourse. Following Habermas, the argument relies on the following assumptions: ::(a) that communication can proceed between two individuals only on the basis of a consensus (usually implicit) regarding the validity claims raised by the speech acts they exchange; ::(b) that these validity claims concern at least three dimensions of validity: :::: I, truthfulness :::: WE, rightness :::: IT, truth ::(c) that a mutual understanding is maintained on the basis of the shared presupposition that any validity claim agreed upon could be justified, if necessary, by making recourse to good reasons. From these premises it is concluded that any individual engaging in communication is accountable for the normative validity of the claims they raise. By earnestly offering a speech act to another in communication, a speaker claims not only that what they say is true (IT) but also that it is normatively right (WE) and honest (I). Moreover, the speaker implicitly offers to justify these claims if challenged and justify them with reasons. Thus, if a speaker, when challenged, can offer no acceptable reasons for the normative framework they implied through the offering of a given speech act, that speech act would be unacceptable because it is irrational. In its essence the idea of communicative rationality draws upon the implicit validity claims that are inescapably bound to the everyday practices of individuals capable of speech and action. A mutual understanding can be achieved through communication only by fusing the perspectives of individuals, which requires they reach an agreement (even if it is only assumed) on the validity of the speech acts being shared. Moreover, the speech acts shared between individuals in communication are laden with three different types of validity claims, all of which quietly but insistently demand to be justified with good reasons. Communicative rationality appears in the intuitive competencies of communicative actors who would not feel that a mutual understanding had been achieved if the validity claims raised were unjustifiable. Thus, the simple process of reaching an understanding with others impels individuals to be accountable for what they say and to be able to justify the validity claims they raise concerning normative (WE), evaluative (I) and objective matters (IT). = Standards of justification = Of course a very important issue arises from this, which is that what constitutes a good or acceptable justification varies from context to context. Even if it is accepted that rationality must be expanded to include normative and evaluative dimensions, it is not clear what it is that makes a speech act justified, because it is unclear what constitutes a good reason. It must be understood that there are different kinds of reasons in relation to the different validity dimensions. This is apparent, because what defines a validity dimension are the procedures of justification that are unique to it. For example, if one claims or implies with their speech act that it is raining outside, a good reason for claiming this is that one saw it out the window. If this were called into question, the claim would be vindicated by looking out the window. This is a very simple way of describing the procedures of justification unique to objective validity claims. However, if one claims or implies with their speech acts that 'abortion is acceptable in certain cases', one's reasons for claiming this must be of a different nature. The speaker would have to direct the attention of the listener to certain features of the social world that are infused with meaning and significance. The speaker would have to draw on insights into, for instance, the vulnerability of individuals under the weight of life's circumstances, the kinds of rights that humans deserve, etc. These types of considerations make up the resources available for the justification of normative validity claims. What constitutes a good reason is a more complex problem. Accepting the distinction between the different kinds of reasons that accompany the differentiation of the validity dimensions does not give any insight into what a good reason in a particular validity dimension would be. In fact, it complicates the issue because it makes it clear that there are different procedures unique to each validity dimension and that these dimensions cannot be reduced to one another. Habermas does suggest some general guidelines concerning the rationality of communicative processes that lead to conclusions (see Universal pragmatics). But his explanations regarding the specific procedures that are unique to each validity dimension are much more elaborate.  Critique  The theory of communicative rationality has been criticized for being utopian and idealistic,Foucault 1988, Calhoun 1992 for being blind to issues of gender, race, ethnicity, and sexuality,Cohen 1995, Fraser 1987, Ryan 1992 and for ignoring the role of conflict, contest, and exclusion in the historical constitution of the public sphere.Eley 1992 More recently, Nikolas Kompridis has taken issue with Habermas' conception of rationality as incoherent and insufficiently complex, proposing a \\"possibility-disclosing\\" role for reason that goes beyond the narrow proceduralism of Habermas' theory. One of the main critiques of Habermas's Communicative Rationality is eurocentrism, and the idea that the western civilization is the only way of life. According to Public Sphere and Communicative Rationality: Interrogating Habermas's Eurocentrism, Habermas does not take into account that there are different societies that happen across the world because certain countries and society's suffer from different weaknesses. Habermas's theories are based on an utopian society while this just is not the case. The authors argue that this type of communication the Habermas offers could actually be implemented because people who do not have access to the resources they would need. This is not just other societies not in the west. European countries have problems with lack of education and the technology necessary to be prepared in order to participate in this community. In Byron Rienstra and Derek Hook article titled, Weakening Habermas: The Undoing of Communicative Rationality, they discuss that Habermas expected too much of the people is talking about. Habermas insinuated that the people are participating in communicative rationality have a broad knowledge on the topic at hand. But according to the authors, this is too much to ask of the people. And since these people do not have the knowledge to participate in communicative rationality, they would have no reason to defend their reasoning or position in society. They even go on to say that the preconditions that Habermas has put forward are extremely demanding and taxing on the public. Habermas also ignored the hindrances that people may face that may cause a person not to stay educated on the topics in order to participate in communicative rationality. For example, in From Communicative Rationality to Communicative Thinking: A Basis for Feminist Theory and Practice by Jane Braatan, it is discussed that women have a less advantage to be involved in communicative rationality due to the history of discrimination in schools. Women have not always had complete access to schooling, and according to Habermas they should not be able to defend their opinions. Another issues that is raised on this topic is the idea that if this theory is developed in today's age, it will segregate people even more. Due to the discrimination that people in lower social classes face, people would not be able keep up with new developments and therefore not be able to continue to contribute. Habermas wants communicative rationality to be considered an everyday language according to Communicative versus Strategic Rationality: Habermas Theory of Communicative Action and the Social Brain. He believes everyone should strive for the ability to be educated and able to defend your position on every topic.

History The idea of a free online resource compiling Shakespeare's works was conceived in 2001 by Eric M. Johnson, then working as a web designer and theater reviewer for the Washington Times newspaper while pursuing a Master's degree at George Mason University. In the process of looking up the source of Shakespearian quotes online, Johnson was surprised to learn that no single web resource allowed users to freely access a comprehensive collection of William Shakespeare's writings. \\"The ones that were comprehensive were not free, and the free ones were not comprehensive\\" Johnson recalled. Johnson started to create just such a free and comprehensive digital collection as part of his graduate program, unveiled as the Open Source Shakespeare website in December 2003. The site was formally announced to the scholarly community in February 2004. According to the site's founder, about 77,000 people made use of the resource in 2005, with a further 170,000 anticipated to visit the site in 2006. The operating costs of the site were minimal; through 2006, these were paid out of pocket by the site's creator. Subsequently, a grant application was made to the National Endowment for the Humanities by Johnson and three members of the English Department of George Mason University to provide funding for the project. Site structure Shakespeare's works are divided on the site into three genres: plays, sonnets, and poems. The site also includes a concordance, search engine, and information about basic usage statistics. The site has gained functionality over time, with a \\"Version 2.0\\" released in 2005 which added the capability for users to search for word stems or phonetically and to save and print search results. In the middle of 2009 a site version designed for portable devices was unveiled, called Mobile Open Source Shakespeare.

Within its native range it is a relatively common plant where it grows in the understory in moist, rich woods, especially those with exposed limestone. Description L. benzoin showing drupes and leaves Spicebush is a deciduous shrub growing to tall. It has a colonial nature and often reproduces by root sprouting, forming clumps or thickets. The leaves are alternately arranged on the stem, simple, long and broad, oval or broadest beyond the middle of the leaf. They have a smooth edge with no teeth and are dark green above and paler below. The leaves, along with the stems are very aromatic when crushed with a spicy, citrusy smell, hence the common names and the specific epithet benzoin. In the fall the leaves turn a very bright and showy yellow color. The yellow flowers grow in showy clusters which appear in early spring, before the leaves begin to grow. The flowers have 6 sepals and a very sweet odor. The ripe fruit is a red, elipsoidal, berrylike drupe, rich in lipids, about long and is eaten by several bird species. It has a \\"turpentine-like\\" taste and aromatic scent, and contains a large seed. Spicebush is dioecious (plants are either male or female), so that both sexes are needed in a garden if one wants drupes with viable seeds. Like other dioecious plants, the female plants have a greater cost of reproduction compared to the male plants. In the wild, the population tends to have more males than females possibly due to the heavier reproductive costs on females. The stem of L. benzoin has a slightly rough, but flat, bark which is covered in small, circular lenticels which give it a rough texture. =Related or potentially confused species= Other species in the genus Lindera also have common names containing the word \\"spicebush\\" and may appear similar. An example is Lindera melissaefolia which grows in swamps in southern US; it is differentiated by its hairy stems. Calycanthus (sweetshrub, spicebush) is in a different family within the Laurales and also has aromatic leaves. Cultivation Spicebush is often cultivated in gardens or edges of gardens. The brightly colored fruits and early flowers along with the spherical growth form make the plant desirable in gardens. It is hardy in USDA zones 4-9 and tolerates shade excellently but will also grow in full sun. When grown in sun the plant tends to grow denser and have more berries and flowers compared to growing in shade or partial shade. It is best to grow the plant from seed as its extensive rootsystem does not handle transplanting well. At least three cultivars have been developed although they are rarely available: *'Rubra' has brick red male flowers, the winter buds are also a darker red brown color. Since it is male it produces no fruit. *'Xanthocarpa,' which has yellow-orange fruits, was discovered in Arnold Arboretum in 1967 by Alfred Fordham. *'Green gold' a male, non-fruiting cultivar with larger ornamental flowers. Although several butterflies and moths used spicebush as a host, they are not considered a serious pest. Uses Male spicebush flowers Due to its habit of growing in rich woods, early land surveyors used spicebush as an indicator of good agricultural land. The leaves, buds, and new growth twigs can be made into a tea. Native Americans, including the Cherokee, Creek, and Iroquois used the plant for treatments in multiple ailments. Ecology Many animals feed on the leaves, twigs, and berries of spicebush. Some mammals include whitetail deer, Eastern cottontail rabbit, opossums. Over 20 species of birds including both gamebirds and song birds such as ring-necked pheasant, bobwhite, ruffed grouse and others have been known to feed on spicebush. The berries are a favorite food of wood thrushs. =Lepidopteran host plant= Male spicebush swallowtail nectaring on a thistle Spicebush is a favorite food plant of two lepidopterous insects: the spicebush swallowtail (Papilio troilus) and the promethea silkmoth (Callosamia promethea). It also supports the caterpillars of the cynthia moth, eastern tiger swallowtail, imperial moth, and the tulip tree beauty. The Xerces Society (2016), Gardening for Butterflies: How You Can Attract and Protect Beautiful, Beneficial Insects, Timber Press. The larvae of the spicebush swallowtail are easily found inside leaves that have been folded over by the application of silk; small larvae are brown, resembling bird droppings, and mature larvae are green. The anterior of a larva has two large eyespots and resembles the head of a snake. Since one or more broods (generations) of spicebush swallowtails typically occur each year, spicebush is a useful plant for the butterfly garden, since the egg-laying females are strongly attracted to it. Promethea moth cocoons, if present, are obvious during the cold season after leaf drop, and resemble dead leaves still hanging from twigs. Neither of these insects is ever present in sufficient quantities to defoliate a medium through large spicebush, although very small specimens may suffer even from a single caterpillar.

The historical territory was much larger than the currently named region, extending from the Totonacapan region of Veracruz Cazones River in the north to the Papaloapan River in the south and then west from the Gulf of Mexico into what is now the Sierra Norte de Puebla region and into parts of Hidalgo. When the Spanish arrived, the Totonac ethnicity dominated this large region, although they themselves were dominated by the Aztec Empire. For this reason, they allied with Hern√°n Cort√©s against Tenochtitl√°n. However, over the colonial period, the Totonac population and territory shrank, especially after 1750 when mestizos began infiltrating Totonacapan, taking political and economic power. This continued into the 19th and 20th centuries, prompting the division of most of historical Totonacpan between the states of Puebla and Veracruz. Today, the term refers only to a region in the north of Veracruz were Totonac culture is still important. This region is home to the El Taj√≠n and Cempoala archeological sites as well as Papantla, which is noted for its performance of the Danza de los Voladores. History Pyramid of the Niches in El Taj√≠n The earliest human settlements in the area date back to about 2000 BCE with agriculture practiced early with those communities on the coast having seafood prominent in the diet, especially mollusks. The area thrived with many small villages and ceremonial center because of abundant agricultural production. The beginning of the Classic period around 300BCE brought great changes to the region as it became part of an important trade route between Teotihuacan and the Mayas. Evidence of Teotihuacan influence become evident including religion and architecture. The name ‚ÄúTotonacapan‚Äù is from the Totonac people (+ ‚Äúpan‚Äù meaning ‚Äúplace‚Äù), who probably arrived to the area between the 8th and 9th centuries. It was populated by other cultures before this, which have since been lost. It is not known how the Totonacs came to occupy and dominate the region, and there are several theories, some of which point to links with Teotihuacan and/or a migration from the interior towards the Gulf coast. Their main archeological sites include El Taj√≠n, Cempoala and Yohualichan (in the Sierra Norte de Puebla). El Taj√≠n is considered crucial to Totonac identity. The territory originally extended from the Papaloapan River in the south to the Cazones River in the north, the Gulf of Mexico on the east and into the Sierra Madre Oriental mountains to the west into what is now the Sierra Norte de Puebla and perhaps even as far as Tulancingo. However, these western areas had become ethnically mixed due to influxes of Nahuas and Otomis long before the Spanish arrived. 19th century Carl Nebel lithograph of people from Totonacapan When the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, the region was dominated by the Totonacs, who were then in turn dominated by the Aztec Empire. Because of this, the Totonacs allied with the Spanish against the Aztecs to conquer Tenochtitl√°n . However, war, disease and forced labor brought the Totonac population down drastically. The Totonac population in Cempoala is estimated to have been about 80,000 when the Spanish arrived in 1519 but with only eighty left in 1550. The Spanish also took their lands for cattle raising until the ethnicity occupied only about half of what it used to. In many areas, the Totonac population was replaced by Spanish, mestizo and African peoples. Until the 17th century, the Spanish mostly respected Totonac leadership as their help against the Aztec made them non-threatening militarily. Evangelization was likewise slow, with only sixteen parishes in all of Totonacapan by 1750. This means that until 1750, the political and social situation in Totonacapan was relatively stable. However, from this time to the present various political, social and economic developments have served to weaken and split Totonac control over its historical territory. Mestizos began to take indigenous land and felt sufficiently powerful enough to begin taking political and military power. From 1750 to 1820, there were a series of Totonac revolts against these incursions, especially in the Papantla and Orizaba regions. This rebellion caused the Totonacs to ally with the cause for independence early, led by Seraf√≠n Olarte, but they were crushed by royalist forces. The struggle continued after Independence with a new insurrection led by Olarte's son, Mariano Olarte with the flash point being the prohibition of Totonac Holy Week rites, which the Puebla diocese deemed ‚Äútoo pagan.‚Äù The first president of Mexico, Guadalupe Victoria, who had fought with Seraf√≠n Olarte, mediated the dispute but was unable to get the diocese to relent. The rebellions by the Totonac spurred mestizo and Spanish authorities into a series of moves that resulted in the splitting of historical Totonacapan mostly between the modern states of Veracruz and Puebla, with some small areas now part of Hidalgo over the course of the 19th century. Borders fluctuated over this time but were set by the beginning of Mexican Revolution. The mestizos, meanwhile, were privatizing communally held land, confiscating religious property and prohibiting public worship to weaken the power of indigenous authorities. The Totonacs had some luck in turning the tide during the Mexican Revolution but these gains were lost in the 1930s. The process of dividing Totonacapan into various smaller entities politically and economically continued through the 20th century. One development was the construction of the Mexico City-Tuxpan highway and the development of petroleum extraction in the Poza Rica area. The Teziutl√°n-Tlatlauquitepec highway to Tenampulco reinforced a Veracruz/Puebla border. While there is still a very population of Totonacs in both states, as Mexico's tenth largest indigenous group, today, what is called Totonacapan is only a fraction of former Totonac lands. It refers to a region in Veracruz, which is made up of fifteen municipalities: Cazones de Herrera, Coahuitl√°n, Coatzintla, Coyutla, Chumatlan, Espinal, Filomeno Mata, Guti√©rrez Zamora, Mecatl√°n, Papantla, Poza Rica de Hidalgo, Tecolutla, Tihuatl√°n and Zozocolco de Hidalgo . The Totonac population continues to decline in both states, especially since the 1980s with many migrating out due to the poor economy of the region. History has put pressure on the Totonac language, with speakers switching over to Spanish and in some cases, to Nahuatl even though those who change language still consider themselves Totonac. Archeological sites Pyramid at the Cempoala site The most important archeological site in the region is El Taj√≠n, located near Papantla, and is one of the largest and most important cities of the Classic era of Mesoamerica. A part of the Classic Veracruz culture, El Taj√≠n flourished from 600 to 1200 C.E. and during this time numerous temples, palaces, ballcourts, and pyramids were built. El Taj√≠n was named a World Heritage Site in 1992, due to its cultural importance, especially to the Totonac people and its architecture. This architecture includes the use of decorative niches and cement in forms unknown in the rest of Mesoamerica. Its best-known monument is the Pyramid of the Niches, but other important monuments include the Arroyo Group, the North and South Ballcourts and the palaces of Taj√≠n Chico. Since the 1970s, El Tajin has been the most important archeological site in Veracruz for tourists, attracting over 650,000 visitors a year. The next most important site is Cempoala which during the height of the Totonacs, was the most important city. It was still important when the Spanish arrived, but it became mostly abandoned afterwards. The area contains some of the earliest known archeological sites in Veracruz such as Trapiche, Chalahuite el Viej√≥n, Limoncito and Tlalixcoyan. One of the earliest sites dates to around 1500 BCE is Remojadas which is considered the center of a pre Totonac culture called by the same name. Geography and environment Mouth of the Tecolutla River Most of the modern Totonacapan of Veracruz state extends from the coast to the edges of the Sierra Madre Oriental, with altitudes of between zero and 800 meters above sea level. Most of it has a hot and humid climate with extreme lows reaching 5C in the highest elevations and high temperatures reaching 38C between March and June. The average annual temperature ranges from 15 to 20C. Annual rainfall averages between 1,500 and 1,800mm per year with most falling between July and November. The most important rivers include Cazones, Tecolutla and Necaxa, which is a tributary of the Tecolutla. There are also numerous streams the largest of which include the Zozocolco, the Tecac√°n and the Chumatl√°n. The wild vegetation is tropical rainforest, rich in hardwoods with include species such as cedar, mahogany, fig, kapok, laurel, willow and more. However, their range is limited to less than 4,000 hectares in about seven municipalities. Wildlife includes squirrels, rabbits, armadillos, opossums, fresh and saltwater shrimp, trout, and various bird species. Economy Fields in Cazones de Herrera Totonacapan is one of Mexico poorest regions, despite the fact that there is oil production in and around Poza Rica. The reason is that much of the region is still isolated and rural. For example, Mecatlan is one of the sixty poorest municipalities in the country, with half of home without running water and seventy percent with dirt floors. Illiteracy is four times the national level. Infrastructure such as roadways and housing is in poor condition especially in the mountain areas. The construction of bridges is considered to be important to the regions development, especially to connect the coastline with the interior cities of Mexico. The principal economic activities are agriculture, the raising of cattle and in some areas, fishing. The coastal areas mostly produce corn with two harvests per year along with beans, chili peppers, oranges, limes, grapefruit, mandarin oranges, sugar cane, bananas, vanilla, sesame seed and more. The mountain areas principally grow coffee, black pepper, sapote and mamey. Much of the citrus fruit is exported. Aside from cattle there is some other livestock such as pigs, sheep, horses and domestic fowl as well as bees. The mountain areas of the region are home to the vanilla plant, which is a kind of orchid which produces the bean from which the flavoring comes. The bean was highly valued long before the arrival of the Spanish, used for religious rituals, perfumes and healing potions as well as a flavoring. When the Aztecs conquered Totonacapan, part of the tribute was in vanilla beans, mostly used to flavor chocolate drinks in Tenochtitl√°n. In the recent past, vanilla was a major trade in the region, with a number of vanilla ‚Äúbarons‚Äù in the first half of the 20th century making fortunes as middlemen and exporters. However, it began to be grown more cheaply elsewhere and the creation of synthetic vanilla collapsed the market for authentic Mexican vanilla. Despite the quality due to ideal growing conditions, Mexico produces only fifteen percent of the world's vanilla. However, a number of entrepreneurs are working to bring the crop back experimenting with production rates and promoting the quality of Totonacapan-grown vanilla. The best vanilla still comes from here. Panorama of downtown Poza Rica The Tecolutla, Nautla and Vega de la Torre zones are fishing centers were cooperatives catch catfish, crayfish and other species although crayfish species are endangered. The main industry is related to oil and gas production although this is limited to the very north of the region. There are also some small industries dedicated to the production of bricks, piloncillo, furniture and handcrafts. One nascent economic initiative is ecotourism, with nature parks such as Parque Xanath just outside Papantla and the Totonac culture, especially the Voladores and the growing of vanilla. Papantla is the modern capital of Totonac culture, with a Volador pole in the atrium of the main church. Zozocolca has various waterfalls surrounded by large and leafy trees and slabs of rock which guide the water. Parque Takilhsukut is a nature park which is also dedicated to the preservation of Totonac culture with workshops, concerts, and more for both visitors and the local population. Its school for Voladores has children as young as nine. It is one of the sites of the Cumbre Taj√≠n annual festival. Demographics and culture Totonac man in church atrium of Papantla Although the Totonac people are no longer the dominant population in Totonacapan, their culture remains an important part of the Veracruz region still named for them. The various municipalities have formal, generally mestizo-dominated, governments but there are also councils of elders in many indigenous communities which have various relationships with the various municipal authorities. Totonac languages are principally spoken in Veracruz, the north of Puebla and some areas of Hidalgo. Both of the main branches of the language are spoken in Totonacapan in Veracruz where about half of all Totonac speakers live. The percentage of ethnic Totonacs which speak the language is declining as parents stop teaching it to their children. This phenomenon is more pronounced in the lowland areas where it has all but disappeared in some places. The largest concentration of speakers is in Papantla with large concentrations on the Veracruz/Puebla border. Traditional dances play an important part in Totonac identity. There are four basic categories: Voladores, those depicting aspects of the Spanish conquest, Afro- European and those which were imposed by Catholic clergy such as those performed during Las Posadas. The best known of these dances is the Ritual Ceremony of the Voladores of Papantla, which has been recognized as an Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO . However, these dances are also waning and survive mostly in marginalized communities. In very poor communities, dances are dying out because the people do not have the time or money to make or maintain the elaborate costumes. As older instructors die, there are no younger ones to take their place. Most of the population is Catholic although these are split into those who practice the traditional mix of indigenous and Catholic beliefs and reform Catholics who put less emphasis on the political and social aspects of traditional religious practice. In the 1950s, Protestantism was introduced to the area by the Instituto Ling√º√≠stico de Verano which now includes evangelists, Baptists and Pentecostals . Much of the region's cuisine is based on corn, along with wild and cultivated plants and fruits. Much of traditional cuisine survives because of the area's relative remoteness and traditional women still cook over wood fires, grinding corn and other foods on metates. Dishes include soups made from squash, sweet corn and beans. Beans are flavored with sesame seed. Small dishes include tlacoyos with beans, chili peppers with sesame seed, tamales with salted fish, turkey and other fillings, enchiladas zampadas. Vegetable dishes include a green called quelite with beans or with herbs and eggs, chayote with squash seeds, enchiladas with mamey and nopal cactus with eggs. Seafood dishes include shrimp in various preparations including with sesame seed and sweet potato and grilled fish. Meats include various domestic fowl, pork, beef and rabbit, often smoked. Most ingredients are indigenous with a few exceptions such as sesame seed and almonds. Another common dish is zacahuil, which is a kind of corn pudding. Another distinct ethnicity in the region is the Tepehua, whose language is similar to Totonac. Tepehua communities include Chicontepec and Huayacocotla . The Cumbre Taj√≠n is considered to be one of Mexico's five largest festivals and one of the 100 most important in the world. Centered on three sites over five days, the aim of the event is to promote Totonacapan's culture, identity and economy. The event had an economic impact of between 180 and 200 million pesos with over 400,000 visitors, temporarily employing 8,000 workers. The event attracts over 5,000 artists from Veracruz, Mexico and the world with about the same number of activities.

Subterranean fiction is a subgenre of adventure fiction, science fiction, or fantasy which focuses on fictional underground settings, sometimes at the center of the Earth or otherwise deep below the surface. The genre is based on, and has in turn influenced, the Hollow Earth theory. The earliest works in the genre were Enlightenment-era philosophical or allegorical works, in which the underground setting was often largely incidental. In the late 19th century, however, more pseudoscientific or proto-science-fictional motifs gained prevalence. Common themes have included a depiction of the underground world as more primitive than the surface, either culturally, technologically or biologically, or in some combination thereof. The former cases usually see the setting used as a venue for sword-and-sorcery fiction, while the latter often features cryptids or creatures extinct on the surface, such as dinosaurs or archaic humans. A less frequent theme has the underground world much more technologically advanced than the surface one, typically either as the refugium of a lost civilization, or (more rarely) as a secret base for space aliens.

Since 1 January 2015 it is part of the town Geestland. It was a component municipality of the former Samtgemeinde Bederkesa. Toponomy and Coat of Arms Elmlohe derives from the homonymous elm tree and lohe, which corresponds to the Old English lea, in place names written leigh in today's spelling, or to Dutch loo , and signifies a glade or wood of glades. Elmlohe uses a canting coat of arms, showing three elm leaves on a blue ground. History Elmlohe emerged at the beginning of the 14th century, when the Bailiffs of Bederkesa erected a castle at the Quabben-Bach beck, a tributary of the Geeste (river). A co-founder of the castle, Werner von Bederkesa, is mentioned in a deed of 1308, issued by the Neuenwalde Nunnery. On the Free Dam, a seigniorial immunity, leading to the castle, the esquires of Elmlohe settled handcrafters and peasants subject to their patronage. The Esquires von Elme and von der Lieth prompted the construction of a church in 1346, consecrated to Saint Mary of Nazareth. The church was originally affiliated to the church in Debstedt (a part of today's Langen bei Bremerhaven) but soon became a parish of its own, due to conflicts between the Frisians there and the Saxons in Elmlohe. Elmlohe then belonged to the Prince- Archbishopric of Bremen (est. as principality of imperial immediacy in 1180). In 1380 ‚Äì under the reign of Prince-Archbishop Albert II ‚Äì knights of the family von Mandelsloh and other Verdian and Bremian robber barons ravaged burghers of Bremen and people in the entire Prince-Archbishopric. In 1381 the city's troops successfully ended the brigandage and captured the castle of Bederkesa and the pertaining bailiwick, including Elmlohe. In 1386 the city of Bremen made the noble family von der Lieth, holding the estates of Elmlohe, its vassal. Because of a felony against the city of Bremen, being his liege, the city sent troops which beleaguered Cord von der Lieth in his castle of Elmlohe and finally destroyed it in 1485. However, the family von der Lieth was allowed to keep the seigniory over the local peasants as vassal of the city. In 1648 the Prince-Archbishopric was transformed into the Duchy of Bremen, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown. In November 1654, after the Second Bremian War, Bremen had to cede Bederkesa and Lehe (a part of today's Bremerhaven) to the Duchy of Bremen. After the Danish occupation (1712‚Äì1715) the Duchy of Bremen became a fief to the House of Hanover. In the 18th century the seigniory was abolished in favour of freehold land property, thus the family von der Lieth and the peasants turned into independent farmers. In 1807 the ephemeric Kingdom of Westphalia annexed the Duchy, before France annexed it in 1810. In 1813 the Duchy was restored to the Electorate of Hanover, which ‚Äì after its upgrade to the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814 ‚Äì incorporated the Duchy in a real union and the Ducal territory, including Elmlohe, became part of the new Stade Region, established in 1823. On the occasion of the 700th anniversary of Elmlohe's foundation the municipality published a book on its history: \\"Elmlohe ‚Äì ein Dorf im Wandel des Zeit 1308‚Äì2008\\". Attractions of Elmlohe Elmlohe is famous throughout Europe for its horse competition taking place at the end of July every year.

Some of the most common Chinese bakery products include mooncakes, sun cakes (Beijing and Taiwan varieties), egg tarts, and wife cakes. The Chinese bakeries that produce these products are present in countries of Chinese ethnicity, and across the world in Chinatowns. The establishments may also serve tea, coffee, and other drinks. Bakery types There are regional differences in cities with large Chinese presences, particularly those in Asia like Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Ipoh, Jakarta, Manila and Bangkok. Bakery fillings especially may be influenced by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, or Thailand. In North America, the largest Chinatowns, such as San Francisco, Vancouver, New York, and Toronto, have the widest range of offerings, including influences from France, Italy, Japan, and Mexico. There are also large overlaps in the products sold at Hong Kong-style and Taiwan-style baked goods; there nevertheless remain significant differences between these two major types. For instance, bread cake and pineapple cake were developed in Taiwan-style bakeries, while the cocktail bun is a Hong Kong style product. Hong Kong bakeries have more western influence due to the 150 years of British rule that ended in 1997, and the nearby presence of the former Portuguese colony of Macau. Taiwan-style bakeries may have more influence from American bakery, Japanese bakery, or Korean bakery styles. Chinese bakeries show considerable variation within mainland China due to the cultural and geographical diversity of the country. Furu bing (ËÖê‰π≥È•º) are sold in the Chaoshan region while nang (È¶ï) is sold in Xinjiang. Shanghainese bakeries are strongly influenced by European bakeries. Some bakeries also offer small snacks traditionally associated with dim sum cuisine. There is considerable overlap between these categories. Eastern-origin pastry Eastern-origin pastry section Some types of steamed or baked buns have a very similar appearance, making it difficult to determine what they have been filled with. Informal de facto standards have developed for indicating the filling by some external mark on the buns, such as a colored dot or a sprinkling of a few sesame seeds.

Sciama 25 January 1989, American Institute of Physics, Niels Bohr Library and ArchivesSciama, Dennis William (1926‚Äì1999), cosmologist. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.  Education and early life Sciama was born in Manchester, England, the son of Nelly Ades and Abraham Sciama.The International Who's Who, 1997-98 He was of Syrian-Jewish ancestry ‚Äî his father born in Manchester and his mother born in Egypt, but both traced their roots back to Aleppo, Syria. Sciama earned his PhD in 1953 at the University of Cambridge supervised by Paul Dirac, with a dissertation on Mach's principle and inertia. His work later influenced the formulation of scalar-tensor theories of gravity. Career and research Sciama taught at Cornell University, King's College London, Harvard University and the University of Texas at Austin, but spent most of his career at the University of Cambridge (1950s and 1960s) and the University of Oxford as a Senior Research Fellow in All Souls College, Oxford (1970s and early 1980s). In 1983, he moved from Oxford to Trieste, becoming Professor of Astrophysics at the International School of Advanced Studies (SISSA), and a consultant with the International Centre for Theoretical Physics. He also taught at the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa. From 1972 to 1973 he was the Donegall Lecturer in Mathematics at Trinity College Dublin.The Dublin University calendar 1972-73 Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin During the 1990s, he divided his time between Trieste (with a residence in nearby Venice) and his main residence at Oxford, where he was a visiting professor until the end of his life. Sciama made connections among some topics in astronomy and astrophysics. He wrote on radio astronomy, X-ray astronomy, quasars, the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave radiation, the interstellar and intergalactic medium, astroparticle physics and the nature of dark matter. Most significant was his work in general relativity, with and without quantum theory, and black holes. He helped revitalize the classical relativistic alternative to general relativity known as Einstein-Cartan gravity. Early in his career, he supported Fred Hoyle's steady state cosmology, and interacted with Hoyle, Hermann Bondi, and Thomas Gold. When evidence against the steady state theory, e.g., the cosmic microwave radiation, mounted in the 1960s, Sciama abandoned it and worked on the Big Bang cosmology; he was perhaps the only prominent Steady-State supporter to switch sides (Hoyle continued to work on modifications of steady-state for the rest of his life, while Bondi and Gold moved away from cosmology during the 1960s). During his last years, Sciama became interested in the issue of dark matter in galaxies. Among other aspects he pursued a theory of dark matter that consists of a heavy neutrino, certainly disfavored in his realization, but still possible in a more complicated scenario. =Doctoral students= Several leading astrophysicists and cosmologists of the modern era completed their doctorates under Sciama's supervision, notably: *George Ellis (1964) *Stephen Hawking (1966) *Brandon Carter (1967) *Martin Rees (1967) *Gary Gibbons (1973) *James Binney (1975) *John D. Barrow (1977) *Philip Candelas (1977)Candelas PhD Theses http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=OXVU1&search;_scope=LSCOP_OX&docId;=oxfaleph012115106&fn;=permalink *David Deutsch (1978) *Adrian Melott (1981) *Antony Valentini (1992) Sciama also strongly influenced Roger Penrose, who dedicated his The Road to Reality to Sciama's memory. The 1960s group he led in Cambridge (which included Ellis, Hawking, Sciama brought Penrose and Hawking together Rees, and Carter), has proved of lasting influence. = Publications = * * Short (104 pages) and clearly written non-mathematical book on the physical and conceptual foundations of General Relativity. Could be read with profit by physics students before immersing themselves in more technical studies of General Relativity. * * =Awards and honours= Sciama was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1983. He was also an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society and the Academia Lincei of Rome. He served as president of the International Society of General Relativity and Gravitation, 1980‚Äì84. His work at SISSA and the University of Oxford led to the creation of a lecture series in his honour, the Dennis Sciama Memorial Lectures.Dennis Sciama Memorial Lectures , SISSA, Italy. In 2009, the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth elected to name their new building, and their supercomputer in 2011, in his honour. Sciama has been portrayed in a number of biographical projects about his most famous student, Stephen Hawking. In the 2004 BBC TV movie Hawking, Sciama was played by John Sessions. In the 2014 film The Theory of Everything, Sciama was played by David Thewlis; physicist Adrian Melott strongly criticized the portrayal of Sciama in the film. Personal life Sciama was of Jewish-Syrian descent and an avowed atheist. In 1959, Sciama married Lidia Dina, a social anthropologist, who survived him, along with their two daughters.

Count Semyon Romanovich Vorontsov (or Woronzow, ; 26 June 17449 July 1832) was a Russian diplomat from the aristocratic Russian Vorontsov family, whose siblings included Alexander Vorontsov, Elizaveta Vorontsova and Yekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova. He resided in Britain for the last 47 years of his life, from 1785 until his death in 1832, during which time he was the Russian ambassador to the Kingdom of Great Britain from 1785 to 1800 and to the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1806. Life and career Vorontsov's parents were Roman Larionovich Vorontsov (1717‚Äì1783) and Marfa Ivanovna Surmina (1718‚Äì1745).Woronzow, HumphrysFamilyTree, accessed April 4, 2012 He distinguished himself during the first Russo-Turkish War at Larga and Kagula in 1770. In 1783, he was appointed Russian minister at Vienna, but in 1785 was transferred to London. Vorontsov soon attained great influence and authority in Great Britain. Quickly acquainting himself with the characteristics of English institutions, with their ways and methods, he was able to render important services to his country. Thus, during the second Russo-Turkish War, 1787-1792 he contributed to bring about the disarmament of the auxiliary British fleet, which had been fitted out to assist the Turks; and in 1793 obtained a renewal of the commercial treaty between Great Britain and Russia. Over the next three years, he irritated Empress Catherine II with his vehement advocacy of the exiled Bourbons, sharp criticism of the Armed Neutrality of the North, which he considered disadvantageous to Russia, and denunciation of the partitions of Poland as contrary to the first principles of equity and a shock to the conscience of Western Europe. On the accession of Paul I in 1796, Vorontsov was raised to the rank of ambassador extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary and was awarded immense estates in Finland. Neither Vorontsov's detention of the Russian squadron under Makarov in British ports nor his refusal, after the death of Alexander Bezborodko, to accept the dignity of imperial chancellor could alienate the favor of Paul. It was only when the emperor himself began to draw nearer to France that he began to consider Vorontsov as incompetent to serve Russia in England, and in February 1800 all the count's estates were confiscated. Alexander I on his accession in 1801 at once reinstated him, but ill health and family affairs induced him to resign his post in 1806. From that time till his death in 1832, he continued to live in London. Greville noted in his diary on 3 December 1829, ‚ÄùOld Woronzow was Ambassador here many years, has lived here ever since, and never learnt a word of English.‚ÄùCharles C. F. Greville, A Journal of the Reigns of King George IV and King William IV, volume I (London, Longmans Green & Co, 1874), at page 250 Besides his valuable Note on the Russian War and numerous letters, Vorontsov was the author of an autobiography and Notes on the Internal Government of Russia. Vorontsov married Ekaterina Alekseevna Seniavina. His son Michael continued his father's Anglophile ways and was an eminent commander in the war against Napoleon and in the Russian subjugation of the Caucasus. His daughter Catherine married George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke, 8th Earl of Montgomery. He was buried in the Pembroke family vault in Marylebone, London, and the street where he resided in St. John's Wood, London, is now called Woronzow Road.

There, the Indian Imperial Police attempted to arrest the group leaders. A riot ensued, and they were fired upon by the police, resulting in the deaths of 20 people. Komagata Maru sailed from British Hong Kong, via Shanghai, China, and Yokohama, Japan, to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in 1914, carrying 376 passengers from Punjab province in British India. The passengers comprised 337 Sikhs, 27 Muslims and 12 Hindus, all Punjabis and British subjects. Of these 376 passengers, 24 were admitted to Canada, but the other 352 were not allowed to disembark in Canada, and the ship was forced to leave Canadian waters. The ship was escorted by , one of Canada's first two naval vessels. This was one of several incidents in the early 20th century in which exclusion laws in Canada and the United States were used to exclude immigrants of Asian origin. Immigration controls in Canada The Canadian government's first attempt to restrict immigration from British India was an Order in Council passed on January 8, 1908, that prohibited immigration of persons who \\"in the opinion of the Minister of the Interior\\" did not \\"come from the country of their birth or citizenship by a continuous journey and or through tickets purchased before leaving their country of their birth or nationality\\". In practice this continuous journey regulation applied only to ships that began their voyage in India, as the great distance usually necessitated a stopover in Japan or Hawaii. These regulations came at a time when Canada was accepting huge numbers of immigrants, almost all of whom came from Europe. More than 400,000 arrived in 1913, an annual figure that has not been equaled since. Race relations in Vancouver had been strained in the years before the arrival of the Komagata Maru, culminating in the Anti-Oriental Riots of 1907. Gurdit Singh's initial idea Portrait of Baba Gurdit Singh, Komagata Maru Memorial, Budge Budge Gurdit Singh Sandhu, from Sarhali (not to be confused with Gurdit Singh Jawanda from Haripur Khalsa, a 1906 Indo- Canadian immigration pioneer), was a Singaporean businessman who was aware that Canadian exclusion laws were preventing Punjabis from immigrating there. He wanted to circumvent these laws by hiring a boat to sail from Calcutta to Vancouver. His aim was to help his compatriots whose previous journeys to Canada had been blocked. Though Gurdit Singh was apparently aware of regulations when he chartered the ship Komagata Maru in January 1914,Johnston, H., op. cit., p. 26. he continued with his enterprise in order to challenge the continuous journey regulation, in the hope of opening the door for immigration from India to Canada. At the same time, in January 1914, he publicly espoused the Ghadarite cause while in Hong Kong.Johnston, H., op. cit., pp. 24 and 25. The Ghadar Movement was an organization founded by Punjab residents of the United States and Canada in June 1913 with the aim of gaining India independence from British rule. It was also known as the Khalsa Association of the Pacific Coast. =Passengers= The passengers consisted of 337 Sikhs, 27 Muslims, and 12 Hindus, all British subjects. One of the Sikh passengers, Jagat Singh Thind, was the youngest brother of Bhagat Singh Thind, an Indian-American Sikh writer and lecturer on \\"spiritual science\\" who was involved in an important legal battle over the rights of Indians to obtain U.S. citizenship (United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind). The Canadian Government was aware that amongst the passengers were a number of Indian nationalists intent on creating disorder in support of efforts to overthrow British rule in India. (see Ghadar conspiracy, Annie Larsen arms plot, and Christmas Day Plot.) In addition to the security risks, there was a desire to prevent Indian nationals from immigrating to Canada.Johnston, Hugh J. M. The Voyage of the Komagata Maru: the Sikh Challenge to Canada's Colour Bar. Delhi: Oxford University Press. 1979. VoyageDeparture from Hong Kong= Hong Kong became the point of departure. The ship was scheduled to leave in March, but Singh was arrested for selling tickets for an illegal voyage. After several months he was released on bail and given permission by Francis Henry May, the Governor of Hong Kong, to set sail. The ship departed on April 4 with 165 passengers. More passengers joined at Shanghai on April 8, and the ship arrived at Yokohama on April 14. It left Yokohama on May 3 with its complement of 376 passengers and sailed into Burrard Inlet, near Vancouver, on May 23. The Indian Nationalist revolutionaries Barkatullah and Bhagwaan Singh Giani met with the ship en route. Bhagwaan Singh Giani was head priest of the Gurdwara in Vancouver and had been one of three delegates sent to London and India to represent the case of Indians in Canada. Ghadarite literature was disseminated on board and political meetings took place on board. A passenger told a British officer: \\"This ship belongs to the whole of India, this is a symbol of the honour of India and if this was detained, there would be mutiny in the armies\\". =Arrival in Vancouver= Komagata Maru (furthest ship on the left) being escorted by and a swarm of small boats When Komagata Maru arrived in Canadian waters, first at Coal Harbour in Burrard Inlet some 200 meters off CPR Pier A, it was not allowed to dock. The first immigration officer to meet the ship in Vancouver was Fred \\"Cyclone\\" Taylor.Whitehead, E., Cyclone Taylor: A Hockey Legend, p. 159 While Prime Minister of Canada Robert Borden decided what to do with the ship, the Conservative Premier of British Columbia, Richard McBride, gave a categorical statement that the passengers would not be allowed to disembark. Conservative MP H. H. Stevens organized a public meeting against allowing the ship's passengers to disembark and urged the government to refuse to allow the ship to remain. Stevens worked with immigration official Malcolm R.J. Reid to keep the passengers off shore. Reid's intransigence, supported by Stevens, led to mistreatment of the passengers on the ship and prolonged its departure date, which was not resolved until the intervention of the federal Minister of Agriculture, Martin Burrell, MP for Yale‚ÄîCariboo. Meanwhile, a \\"shore committee\\" had been formed with Husain Rahim and Sohan Lal Pathak. Protest meetings were held in Canada and the United States. At one, held in Dominion Hall, Vancouver, the assembly resolved that if the passengers were not allowed off, Indo-Canadians should follow them back to India to start a rebellion or Ghadar. A British government agent who infiltrated the meeting wired government officials in London and Ottawa to tell them that supporters of the Ghadar Party were on the ship. The shore committee raised $22,000 as an installment for chartering the ship. They also launched a lawsuit under J. Edward Bird's legal counsel on behalf of Munshi Singh, one of the passengers. On July 6, the full bench of the British Columbia Court of Appeal delivered a unanimous judgement that under new orders-in-council it had no authority to interfere with the decisions of the Department of Immigration and Colonization.Re Munshi Singh (1914), 20 B.C.R. 243 (B.C.C.A.) Angry passengers relieved the Japanese captain of control of the ship, but the Canadian government ordered the harbour tug Sea Lion to push the ship out to sea. On July 19, the angry passengers mounted an attack. The next day the Vancouver newspaper The Sun reported: \\"Howling masses of Hindus showered policemen with lumps of coal and bricks ... it was like standing underneath a coal chute\\". =Departure from Vancouver= Inspector Reid, H. H. Stevens and Walter Hose on board Komagata Maru. The government also mobilized , a Royal Canadian Navy ship under the command of Commander Hose, with troops from the 11th Regiment \\"Irish Fusiliers of Canada\\", 72nd Regiment \\"Seaforth Highlanders of Canada\\", and the 6th Regiment \\"The Duke of Connaught's Own Rifles\\". In the end, only twenty passengers were admitted to Canada, since the ship had violated the exclusion laws, the passengers did not have the required funds, and they had not sailed directly from India. The ship was turned around and forced to depart for Asia on July 23. During the controversy, Punjabi residents of Canada had supplied information to W. C. Hopkinson, a British immigration official. Two of these informants were murdered in August 1914. Hopkinson was gunned down at the Vancouver courthouse while attending the Punjabi trials in October 1914. =Firing at harbour on return to India= Komagata Maru arrived in Calcutta on September 27. Upon entry into the harbour, the ship was stopped by a British gunboat, and the passengers were placed under guard. The government of the British Raj saw the men on Komagata Maru not only as self-confessed lawbreakers, but also as dangerous political agitators. The British government suspected that white and South Asian radicals were using the incident to create rebellion among South Asians in the Pacific Northwest. When the ship docked at Budge Budge, the police went to arrest Baba Gurdit Singh and the twenty or so other men that they viewed as leaders. He resisted arrest, a friend of his assaulted a policeman, and a general riot ensued. Shots were fired and nineteen of the passengers were killed. Some escaped, but the remainder were arrested and imprisoned or sent to their villages and kept under village arrest for the duration of the First World War. This incident became known as the Budge Budge riot. Ringleader Gurdit Singh Sandhu managed to escape and lived in hiding until 1922. Mahatma Gandhi urged him to give himself up as a \\"true patriot\\". Upon his doing so he was imprisoned for five years. Significance The Komagata Maru incident was widely cited at the time by Indian groups to highlight discrepancies in Canadian immigration laws. Further, the inflamed passions in the wake of the incident were widely cultivated by the Indian revolutionary organisation, the Ghadar Party, to rally support for its aims. In a number of meetings ranging from California in 1914 to the Indian diaspora, prominent Ghadarites including Barkatullah, Tarak Nath Das, and Sohan Singh used the incident as a rallying point to recruit members for the Ghadar movement, most notably in support of promulgating plans to coordinate a massive uprising in India. Their efforts failed due to lack of support from the general population. LegacyIndia= Komagata Maru Shaheed Ganj, Budge Budge In 1952 the Indian government set up a memorial to the Komagata Maru martyrs near the Budge Budge. It was inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. The monument is locally known as the Punjabi Monument and is modelled as a kirpan (dagger) rising up toward the sky. A tripartite agreement was signed between the Kolkata Port Trust, Union Ministry of Culture and the Komagata Maru Trust for the construction of a G + 2 building behind the existing memorial. The building will house an administrative office and library in the ground floor, a museum in the first floor and auditorium in the second. The total cost of the construction will amount to 24 million Indian rupees (INR). In 2014 government of India issued two special coins, INR 5 and INR 100, to mark the centenary of the Komagata Maru incident. =Canada= A plaque commemorating the 75th anniversary of the departure of Komagata Maru was placed in the Sikh gurdwara (temple) in Vancouver on July 23, 1989. A plaque for the 75th anniversary also lies in Portal Park, at 1099 West Hastings Street, Vancouver. A plaque commemorating the 80th anniversary of the arrival of Komagata Maru was placed in the Vancouver harbour in 1994. A monument in remembrance of the Komagata Maru incident was unveiled in July 23, 2012. It is located near the steps of the seawall that lead up to the Vancouver Convention Centre West Building in Coal Harbour. A stamp commemorating the 100th anniversary of the arrival of Komagata Maru was released by Canada Post on May 1, 2014. The first phase of the Komagata Maru Museum was opened in June 2012 at the Khalsa Diwan Society Vancouver Ross Street Temple. Part of 75A Street in Surrey, British Columbia was renamed Komagata Maru Way on July 31, 2019. = Governmental apologies = In response to calls for the government of Canada to address historic wrongs involving immigration and wartime measures, the Conservative government in 2006 created the community historical recognition program to provide grant and contribution funding for community projects linked to wartime measures and immigration restrictions and a national historical recognition program to fund federal initiatives, developed in partnership with various groups. The announcement was made on June 23, 2006, when Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized in the House of Commons for the head tax against Chinese immigrants. On August 6, 2006, Prime Minister Harper made a speech at the Ghadri Babiyan da Mela (Festival of the Ghadar Party) in Surrey, B.C., where he stated that the government of Canada acknowledged the Komagata Maru incident and announced the government's commitment to \\"undertake consultations with the Indo-Canadian community on how best to recognize this sad moment in Canada's history\\". On April 3, 2008, Ruby Dhalla, MP for Brampton‚ÄîSpringdale, tabled motion 469 (M-469) in the House of Commons which read, \\"That, in the opinion of the House, the government should officially apologize to the Indo-Canadian community and to the individuals impacted in the 1914 Komagata Maru incident, in which passengers were prevented from landing in Canada.\\" On May 10, 2008, Jason Kenney, Secretary of State (Multiculturalism and Canadian Identity), announced the Indo-Canadian community would be able to apply for up to $2.5 million in grants and contributions funding to commemorate the Komagata Maru incident. Following further debate on May 15, 2008, Dhalla's motion was passed by the House of Commons. On May 23, 2008, the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia unanimously passed a resolution \\"that this Legislature apologizes for the events of May 23, 1914, when 376 passengers of the Komagata Maru, stationed off Vancouver harbour, were denied entry by Canada. The House deeply regrets that the passengers, who sought refuge in our country and our province, were turned away without benefit of the fair and impartial treatment befitting a society where people of all cultures are welcomed and accepted.\\" On August 3, 2008, Harper appeared at the 13th annual Ghadri Babiyan Da Mela (festival) in Surrey, B.C., to issue an apology for the Komagata Maru incident. He said, in response to the House of Commons motion calling for an apology by the government, \\"On behalf of the government of Canada, I am officially conveying as prime minister that apology.\\" Some members of the Sikh community were unsatisfied with the apology because they expected it to be made in Parliament. Secretary of State Jason Kenney said: \\"The apology has been given and it won't be repeated\\". The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught's Own), which was involved in the expulsion of the Komagata Maru, was commanded by a Sikh, Harjit Sajjan, from 2011 until 2014. He later became Minister of National Defence. On May 18, 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave a formal \\"full apology\\" for the incident in the House of Commons. =Media= The first Canadian play based on the incident is The Komagata Maru Incident, written by Sharon Pollock and presented in January 1976. It was presented again in 2017 by the Stratford Festival, directed by Keira Loughran, starring Kiran Ahluwalia. The first Canadian novel based on the incident is Lions of the Sea, written by Jessi Thind and published in 2001. In 2011 Diana Lobb cited Lions of the Sea as one of the first fictionalized South Asian perspectives on the Komagata Maru in her philosophical dissertation presented to the University of Waterloo. Several friends of the author suggested the title of the novel for the Sikh Heritage Museum of Canada Komagata Maru exhibition in 2014 which was subsequently titled \\"Lions of the Sea: The National Komagata Maru Exhibition.\\" Lions of the Sea is being adapted into a film. Ajmer Rode wrote the play Komagata Maru based on the incident in 1984. In 1989, when Indo-Canadian community of British Columbia commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Komagata Maru, Sadhu Binning and Sukhwant Hundal wrote a play Samundari Sher Nal Takkar (The Battle with the Sealion) and co-edited and produced first issue of Punjabi literary magazine Watan on the Komagata Maru incident. Phinder Dulai wrote A Letter To The Maru - 1914-1994. The letter was a fictionalized narrative utilizing both public record documentation and archival material; the piece ran in 1998 in an issue of Rungh Magazine. In 2004, Ali Kazimi's feature documentary Continuous Journey was released. This is the first in-depth film to examine the events surrounding the turning-away of the Komagata Maru. The primary source research done for the film led to the discovery of rare film footage of the ship in Vancouver harbour. Eight years in the making, Continuous Journey has won over ten awards, including the Most Innovative Canadian Documentary at DOXA, Vancouver 2005, and a Golden Conch at the Mumbai International Film Festival, 2006. Also in 2006, Kazimi assisted broadcaster Jowi Taylor in obtaining a piece of red cedar from Jack Uppal's Goldwood Industries, the first Sikh-owned timber mill in British Columbia, as a way of bringing the Komagata Maru story and the story of Sikhs in Canada into the Six String Nation project. Parts of this wood now serve as kerfing strips on either side of the end block in the interior of Voyageur, the guitar at the heart of the project. The CBC radio play Entry Denied, by the Indo- Canadian scriptwriter Sugith Varughese focuses on the incident. In early 2006, Deepa Mehta, a film director, said she would produce a film about the incident titled Komagata Maru. On October 9, 2008, it was announced that she had recast the lead role in favour of Akshay Kumar and Shriya Saran with a budget of $35 million. In 2012, filmmaker Ali Kazimi's book Undesirables: White Canada and the Komagata Maru was published by Douglas & McIntyre. In 2014, dream / arteries, written by Phinder Dulai, was published by Talon Books. The poetry book begins with a suite of poems that utilize archival records, public repositories, and online uploaded material never published before, including new photographs of the Komagata Maru from the Vancouver Public Library. Simon Fraser University Library launched a website Komagata Maru: Continuing the Journey in 2012 funded by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada under the auspices of the Community Historical Recognition Program (CHRP). This website contains information and documents related to the Komagata Maru incident and a timeline that unfolds the details and supports teaching, research and knowledge about the Komagata Maru for school-aged, post-secondary and general audiences.

A Roman Catholic priest, Liteky received the award for braving intense fire to carry 20 wounded soldiers to safety during a 1967 battle. He later left the priesthood, became a social activist, and in 1986 renounced his Medal of Honor.  Military service  Born on February 14, 1931, in Washington, D.C., Liteky joined the Army from Fort Hamilton, New York. He served in Vietnam as a captain and chaplain in Headquarters and Headquarters Company of the 199th Infantry Brigade. On December 6, 1967, near Phuoc-Lac in South Vietnam's Bi√™n H√≤a Province, he was accompanying Company A, 4th Battalion, 199th Light Infantry Brigade, on a search and destroy mission when they came under heavy fire from a numerically superior enemy force. Seeing two wounded men lying from an enemy machine gun, Liteky shielded them with his body and, once the volume of fire had sufficiently decreased, dragged them to the relative safety of a helicopter landing zone. Although wounded in the neck and foot, he continued to expose himself to hostile fire in order to rescue more of the wounded and administer last rites to the dying. When the landing zone came under fire, he stood in the open and directed the medical evacuation helicopters in and out of the area. After the wounded had been evacuated, he returned to the perimeter to encourage the remaining soldiers until Company A was relieved the next morning. Liteky carried a total of 20 soldiers to safety during the battle. For these actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor.  Activism  Liteky left the priesthood in 1975. In 1983, he married a former nun named Judy Balch (1942‚Äì2016), who encouraged his involvement in social justice activities, particularly protesting the School of the Americas (now the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation) at Fort Benning, Georgia. On July 29, 1986, he renounced his Medal of Honor by placing it in an envelope addressed to then-President Ronald Reagan near the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The decoration is on display at the National Museum of American History. In doing this, he became the only recipient to have renounced the Medal. He wanted to renounce his Medal of Honor before embarking, in September 1986, on the Veterans Fast for Life in protest against the U.S. policies in Central America.S. Brian Willson, Blood on the Tracks: The Life and Times of S. Brian Willson, PM Press, 2011, , p. 173. He also opposed the United States' invasion of Iraq. He died on January 20, 2017 at the age of 85. Medal of Honor citation Liteky (second from right) receiving the Medal of Honor from President Lyndon B.

The game is set in a fictionalized World War II Europe with science fiction elements. An advanced game engine, the Silent Storm engine, was developed for the game and reused in several later titles. Silent Storm was followed by the expansion Silent Storm: Sentinels in 2004. A third game taking place in the same setting, Hammer & Sickle, was co- developed by Novik&Co; and released in 2005. A Gold edition containing both the original game and the expansion was released in Europe later that same year. Gameplay An in-game screenshot showing troops and Panzerkleins The player commands a team of up to six elite soldiers on the Axis or Allied side, undertaking a variety of missions. Once the player begins a campaign, they may select a premade character or create their own to lead the team through the game. Once the introductory mission is complete, the player can access a base complete with a medical station, armoury, personnel, and a panzerklein hangar. From this point, the player may select a team of six characters from a pool of 20. Each character has a role such as medic, sniper, scout, grenadier, soldier or engineer. Each role has different advantages and liabilities in battle. As the player progresses through the game, the armoury will receive new weapons for the player to use, either stolen from enemies or contributed from their own forces. Silent Storm depicts a wide variety of the authentic weaponry and equipment of circa 1943 with great detail. Mixed into otherwise realistic elements is a plot that features secret weapon projects reminiscent of spy-fi, including energy weapons. Most notable are the Panzerkleins (pseudo-German for \\"little tanks\\"), crude powered armour suits. The game features a remarkably advanced physics model. Nearly all structures are completely destructible. This has many tactical effects in the combat. For instance, if a character hears an enemy moving in an adjacent room, they can simply fire through the wall to attack them. Silent Storm also employs ragdoll physics for bodies according to the precise velocity of an impact. Fully three-dimensional mapping allows for obstruction calculations and cover effects from all angles. Bullets ricochet and their stopping power depends on the weapon. The effects are exaggerated for a more cinematic experience (a hail of non-fatal bullets only make the target shake, but a single fatal bullet can send the target flying). Plot The game's story takes place during World War II in an alternate history. Thor's Hammer Organization (THO), is a shadowy organization with connections all over Europe and the goal of world domination. THO knows that this goal cannot be attained while there are powers capable of challenging them, and aims to use its connections and advanced technology to make sure the two sides of World War II devastate each other, while THO makes a grab for power when both are exhausted. The obvious influence of Norse mythology on the organization's name is further shown by the fact that all THO members use a mythological name as their call sign. In exchange for the services of both Allied and Axis higher-ups, Thor's Hammer provides them with some of their inventions, including Panzerkleins. Panzerkleins are very difficult to destroy, as they are essentially immune to small arms fire. Reception Silent Storm was awarded \\"E3 2003 Best of Show\\" in the tactical genre by Wargamer.com. The game's Metacritic score, GameTab score and MobyRank are 83, 82.93% and 84, respectively. The game however suffered from a lack of sales in the United States, partially due to lack of marketing. While praised for its tactical depth, aesthetics and the quality of its game engine, the game has been criticized for its \\"silly\\", \\"over-the-top\\" story and voice acting, and for its inclusion of science fiction elements--specifically the Panzerkleins--and their effect upon game balance in the latter stages of the game. The game's \\"tired\\", \\"played-out\\" World War II setting, poor performance on contemporary hardware, lack of meaningful managerial features, and lack of multiplayer, were also noted. Silent Storm won PC Gamer USs \\"Best Turn-Based Strategy Game 2004\\" award. Mark H. Walker of the magazine praised its \\"sweaty- palm firefights, clever leveling system, and its use of its World War II setting\\". The editors of Computer Gaming World nominated Silent Storm as their 2004 \\"Strategy Game of the Year (General)\\", although it lost to The Sims 2. They wrote that it \\"almost walked away with the award because it exhibited an addictive combination of turn-based strategy and roleplaying that hasn't been so well executed since Jagged Alliance.\\" The staff of X-Play nominated Silent Storm for their 2004 \\"Best Original Game\\" award, which ultimately went to Katamari Damacy.

The D√°il Courts were an integral part of the Irish Republic's policy of undermining British rule in Ireland by establishing a monopoly on the legitimate use of force.The Constructive Work of D√°il √âireann No.1 5 They continued in operation until shortly into the life of the Irish Free State, which was established on 6 December 1922, after the approval of the Anglo-Irish Treaty.  Precursor arbitration courts The precursor of the D√°il Court system was a forum for arbitration commonly known as the Sinn F√©in Court.Carey, J.P.(a) 327 In 1904, Arthur Griffith had reiterated the idea of National Arbitration Courts in every county: At a meeting of the Ministry of D√°il √âireann on 23 June 1919, it was decided to set up a committee on Arbitration Courts.Carey, J.P.(a) 328 Unlike the rules that then regulated who could become a Justice of the Peace, women were expressly eligible to become judges in the new courts.The Constructive Work of D√°il √âireann No.1 The general idea of Parish and District Courts on the lines of those then operating in South County Mayo, County Galway and West County Clare was approved.Carey, J.P.(a) 334 The Parish Courts were usually arbitrated by local Irish Republican Army, Catholic clergy, or Sinn F√©in figures who had authority in the area. In appearance they were less formal than the British civil courts and its officers did not wear regalia associated with the legal profession of the time such as gowns and wigs. They filled a vacuum created by the conflict, and sought to persuade people who were inclined to fear the IRA's revolutionary nature that an independent Ireland would not set aside personal and property rights.The Constructive Work of D√°il √âireann No.1 16 During the war, the courts gradually extended their influence across most of the country, usurping the British law courts as the British government lost its authority in the eyes of the majority. On 4 March 1920, Austin Stack submitted a report regarding \\"courts with coercive jurisdiction\\". However, he did not think that it was yet feasible to make them immediately operational and pointed out that the D√°il Decree, (Decree No. 8, Session 4, 1919)The Constructive Work of D√°il √âireann No.1 6 only provided for Arbitration Courts.Carey, J.P.(a) 332 The D√°il Courts replaced the Sinn F√©in Arbitration Courts, authorised in June 1919. The latter, only fully operational in the west of Ireland and with limited jurisdiction in property disputes, had been coming under pressure to try criminal cases. The critical difference between the two systems was the power to adjudicate assumed by the new courts regardless of the wishes of the parties. While the Arbitration Courts could have been characterised as within the tradition of contract law, the latter assumed powers of coercion characteristic of a state. The new system of D√°il Courts established on 29 June 1920 was therefore much more ambitious and more geographically widespread than its predecessor. A proposed amendment, by Ulster deputies Joseph O'Doherty and Ernest Blythe, to remove the right of clergymen to sit as ex-officio members, was defeated.Tom Wall Getting Them Out Dublin Review of Books 2008 The first meeting of a Sinn F√©in/republican court was in Ballinrobe, South Mayo. In his witness statement, (Bureau of Military History) William T. O'Keeffe, a Staff Officer with the South Mayo Brigade, IRA, credited men from the Claremorris Battalion, Commandant P.R. Hughes in particular (Hughes was Officer in Command of IRA Intelligence and Communications and later appointed one of the first District Justices of the Irish Free State in 1923) along with solicitor Connor A. Maguire (who became a Barrister-at-Law in 1922, and who later served as Attorney General of the Irish Free State (1932), President of the High Court (1936) and Chief Justice (1946)http://www.supremecourt.ie/supremecourt/sclibrary3.nsf/pagecurrent/B8E6388E466B6FB680257315005A41D3?opendocument&l;=en) as being responsible for the establishment of the first Sinn F√©in courts. Subsequently, Comdt. Hughes and Maguire sat as judges in the courts. Overview Henry Hanna KC, of the High Court of the Irish Free State explained some of the reasons why the D√°il Courts successfully took root as follows: The system consisted of:Courts.ie * Parish Courts, which dealt with the most minor civil and criminal matters, * District Courts, which dealt with more serious civil and criminal matters and which heard appeals from the Parish Court, * Circuit Courts composed of four circuits, with unlimited civil and criminal jurisdiction, and *a Supreme Court, operating as both a court of first instance and an appellate court. Judge Hanna, in his overview of the Courts, illustrated the anti-British nature of the 'movement' by referring to this provision of the Code of Rules of the D√°il Courts: Disputes heard The extent of the operation of the D√°il Court system may be judged from the fact that 900 Parish Courts and 77 District Courts came into operation. Among the offences dealt with by the courts were \\"rowdyism\\", larceny, breaches of the licensing laws, damage to property, 'abusive language towards women', bank and post-office robberies and assaults. Punishment for these offences varied, including the returning of stolen property, repairing damage, fines, and other means of restitution and awarding damages. Incarceration was not a commonly available option to the court during the conflict but it was imposed by the courts. The problem of incarceration then fell to the IRP despite the fact that no government funds were made available for costs incurred. Serious offences could merit exile from Ireland, which increased the workload of some English courts dramatically as those condemned sometimes resorted to the 'enemy courts'. Treason, as interpreted by the IRA, was punishable by death, and was not part of the D√°il courts' remit, being dealt with summarily by court-martial in absentia. The laws and precedence of the Irish Republic were taken from the law that existed in Ireland on the day D√°il √âireann first sat (21 January 1919), with the addition of all D√°il decrees issued from that date. It was theoretically possible to cite Brehon, French and Roman law, although this rarely happened in practice. In some areas where the British military presence was especially strong (such as County Cork), the courts could only meet intermittently. It was while presiding at a District Court on 12 August 1920, that Terence MacSwiney was arrested. The courts' rulings were enforced by IRA Volunteers and the Irish Republican Police, the former often viewing the courts as a distraction from what they considered their main task. The courts were important in bringing the IRA further under the authority of the D√°il in some parts, which hitherto had been little more than nominal, as some commanders were overly inclined to prize their autonomy. Efficacy Hostility to the courts was not confined to those against the Irish Republic. Peadar O'Donnell, a socialist and senior IRA officer in north-east Donegal, attempted to subvert its decisions when he felt that the interests of large estate-holders were being upheld. He prevented Republican Police in his Brigade area from enforcing such judgements, particularly of the Land Arbitration Courts. O'Donnell's insubordination finally provoked the intervention of Headquarters. After the Truce declared between the British and Irish sides in July 1921,the Dail Courts, which had largely been suppressed during hostilities, re-emerged across the country. Minister Austin Stack instructed local Sinn Fein and IRA leaders to set up and administer Courts in all localities and republican judges such as Diarmuid Crowley, who had been arrested in 1920 were released and were able to resume their work.  The Rise and Fall of the Dail Courts, the Irish Story It was during the Truce period that the republican courts took on much of the burden of administering justice throughout Ireland. However difficulties also crept into the D√°il Court system. Abuses crept in, and in many instances litigants who anticipated an adverse decision in the British Courts resorted to the D√°il Courts to restrain their opponents from the continuance of the proceedings in the other Court. There were traces that the D√°il Courts were used as channels of corruption, and by persons not in search of justice but anxious for the obstruction of justice. Soon after the outbreak of the Civil War, the Provisional Government suspended the Dail Courts. Then, on July 26 1922, after they refused to observe an order for habeas corpus that was granted by Judge Diarmuid Crowley in July 1922 in favour of a son of George Plunkett, they abolished the Dail Courts by decree.  The Rise and Fall of the Dail Courts, the Irish Story Crowley, who had been appointed a judge of the republican courts in 1920, and imprisoned by the British was also imprisoned by the Provisional Government for issuing an arrest order for Free State Minister for Defence Richard Mulcahy.  The Rise and Fall of the Dail Courts, the Irish Story During the Civil War itself, most of the country was effectively under martial law and suspects could be detained without trial by the military. Thereafter the Provisional Government resurrected the legal system largely as it had existed prior to 1919 in criminal and security cases. Judges included both those formerly appointed under the former British administration, and veterans of the Dail Courts such as Cahir Davitt and James Creed Meredith. Winding up To deal with the anomalous state of affairs arising from there being two rival systems of Courts, within months of its establishment the Executive Council of the Irish Free State appointed a Judicial Committee chaired by Lord Glenavy to decide upon the best system for the new state. The Executive Council then tabled and the D√°il passed the D√°il √âireann Courts (Winding Up) Act 1923. The full title of the Act summarises how the D√°il Courts were wound up: The expression \\"D√°il Court\\" was defined under the Act as meaning: The winding-up of the D√°il Courts was undertaken by Judicial Commissioners appointed under the Act over a two-year period. When only relatively few cases remained to be disposed of, the Judicial Commission was abolished and its jurisdictions and powers transferred to the High Court. During this period, the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 was debated and enacted, creating the Irish courts hierarchy that still largely exists.  Representations in popular culture *Se√°n Keating‚Äôs painting, A Republican Court, 1921, completed 1946, now hangs in Collins Barracks, Cork. *Ken Loach's film The Wind That Shakes the Barley, features an extended fictional scene from a D√°il Court in session. The presiding judge, Lily, (Fiona Lawton), is undermined by Teddy O'Donovan, (P√°draic Delaney), the local senior IRA officer. Rather than enforcing the decision of the court, Teddy releases a convicted prisoner because he has been financing the purchase of rifles. He is publicly challenged by Lily to return to the Court, where the IRA rail against the Gombeen man's conviction (charging a poor old woman an exorbitant rate of interest). The script indicates how the more 'pragmatic' militants were prepared to subvert other institutions of the Republic when they deemed it expedient. This duplicity is a portent of the 'practicality versus principles' dilemma that soon leads to Civil War.

Herbicidal warfare is the use of substances primarily designed to destroy the plant-based ecosystem of an area. Although herbicidal warfare use chemical substances, its main purpose is to disrupt agricultural food production and/or to destroy plants which provide cover or concealment to the enemy, not to asphyxiate or poison humans and/or destroy human-made structures. Herbicidal warfare has been forbidden by the Environmental Modification Convention since 1978, which bans \\"any technique for changing the composition or structure of the Earth's biota\\". History Modern day herbicidal warfare resulted from military research discoveries of plant growth regulators in the Second World War, and is therefore a technological advance on the scorched earth practices by armies throughout history to deprive the enemy of food and cover. Work on military herbicides began in England in 1940, and by 1944, the United States joined in the effort. Even though herbicides are chemicals, due to their mechanism of action (growth regulators), they are often considered a means of biological warfare. Over 1,000 substances were investigated by the war's end for phytotoxic properties, and the Allies envisioned using herbicides to destroy Axis crops. British planners did not believe herbicides were logistically feasible against Germany. In May 1945, USAAF General Victor E. Betrandias advanced a proposal to his superior General Arnold to use of ammonium thiocyanate to reduce rice crops in Japan as part of the bombing raids on their country. This was part of larger set of proposed measures to starve the Japanese. The plan calculated that ammonium thiocyanate would not be seen as \\"gas warfare\\" because the substance was not particularly dangerous to humans. On the other hand, the same plan envisaged that if the U.S. were to engage in \\"gas warfare\\" against Japan, then mustard gas would be an even more effective rice crop killer. The Joint Target Group rejected the plan as tactically unsound, but expressed no moral reservations. = Malaya = During the Malayan Emergency, Britain was the first nation to employ herbicides and defoliants in order to deprive the communist insurgents of cover and targeting food crops as part of the starvation campaign in the early 1950s. Documents showed that the British \\"Trioxone\\" used in Malaya was virtually identical in composition to the Agent Orange later used by the U.S. in Vietnam. It was used to thin jungle trails to limit ambushes, and destruction of native agriculture. For example, in the summer of 1952, 500 hectares were sprayed with 90,000 liters of \\"Trioxone\\" from fire engines. The British found it difficult to operate the machinery in jungle conditions and in full protective gear. The denial of food was considered a decisive weapon in countering the insurgency, so \\"bandit crops\\" were sprayed from aircraft. Discussions in the British government centered on avoiding the thorny issue of whether herbicidal warfare was in violation of the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which prohibited chemical warfare in rather general terms. The British were keen to avoid accusations like the allegations of biological warfare in the Korean War leveled against the U.S. The British government found that the simplest solution was to deny that a war was going on in Malaya. They declared the insurgency to be an internal security matter, thus the use of herbicidal agents was a matter of police action, much like the use of CS gas for riot control. Historical records of DOW chemical show that \\"Super Agent Orange\\", also called DOW Herbicide M-3393, was Agent Orange that was mixed with picloram. Super Orange was known to have been tested by representatives from Fort Detrick and DOW chemical in Texas, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii and later in Malaysia in a cooperative project with the International Rubber Research Institute.\\"Operational Evaluation of Super-Orange\\" via National Security Archives at George Washington University. retrieved 10-24-12 Many Commonwealth personnel who handled and/or used Agent Orange during, and in the decades after, the conflict suffered from serious exposure to dioxin and Agent Orange, which also caused major soil erosion to areas of Malaya. An estimated 10,000 civilians and insurgents in Malaya also suffered heavily from the effects of the defoliant (though many historians agree it was likely more than this number given that Agent Orange was used on a large scale in the Malayan conflict and unlike the U.S., the British government manipulated the numbers and kept its secret very tight in fear of negative world public opinion). =Vietnam War= Kan Lay, 55 years old, and her son, Ke Van Bec, 14 years old, physically and mentally handicapped, pose in front of the billboard denouncing the Operation Ranch Hand. The United States used herbicides in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. Success with Project AGILE field tests with herbicides in South Vietnam in 1961 and inspiration by the British use of herbicides and defoliants during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s led to the formal herbicidal program Trail Dust (1961‚Äì1971). Operation Ranch Hand, a U.S. Air Force program to use C-123K aircraft to spray herbicides over large areas was one of many programs under Operation Trail Dust. The aircrews charged with spraying the defoliant used a sardonic motto-\\"Only you can prevent forests\\"-a shortening of the U.S. Forest Services famous warning to the general public \\"Only you can prevent forest fires\\". The United States and its allies officially claims that herbicidal and incendiary agents like napalm fall outside the definition of \\"chemical weapons\\" and that Britain set the precedent by using them during the Malayan Emergency. Ranch Hand started as a limited program of defoliation of border areas, security perimeters, and crop destruction. As the conflict continued, the anti-crop mission took on more prominence, and (along with other agents) defoliants became used to compel civilians to leave Viet Cong-controlled territories for government-controlled areas. It was also used experimentally for large area forest burning operations that failed to produce the desired results. Map of herbicide usage during the Vietnam war. Defoliation was judged in 1963 as improving visibility in jungles by 30‚Äì75% horizontally, and 40‚Äì80% vertically. Improvements in delivery systems by 1968 increased this to 50‚Äì70% horizontally, and 60‚Äì90% vertically. Ranch Hand pilots were the first to make an accurate 1:125,000 scale map of the Ho Chi Minh trail south of Tchepone, Laos by defoliating swaths perpendicular to the trail every half mile or so. Use of herbicides in Vietnam caused a shortage of commercial pesticides in mid-1966 when the Defense Department had to use powers under the Defense Production Act of 1950 to secure supplies. The concentration of herbicides sprayed in Operation Ranch Hand was more than an order of magnitude greater than that in domestic use. Approximately 10% of the land surface of South Vietnam was sprayed‚Äîabout 17,000 square kilometers. About 85% of the spraying was for defoliation and about 15% was for crop destruction. = War on drugs in South America and Afghanistan =Types of herbicides The United States had technical military symbols for herbicides that have since been replaced by the more common color code names derived from the banding on shipping drums. The US further distinguished between tactical herbicides, which were to be used in combat operations and commercial herbicides, which used in and around military bases, etc. In 1966 the United States Defense Department claimed that herbicides used in Vietnam were not harmful to people or the environment. In 1972 it was advised that a known impurity precluded the use of these herbicides in Vietnam and all remaining stocks should be returned home. In 1977 the United States Air Force destroyed its stocks of Agent Orange 200 miles west of Johnston Island on the incinerator ship M/T Vulcanus. The impurity, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was a suspected carcinogen that may have affected the health of over 17,000 United States servicemen, 4,000 Australians, 1,700 New Zealanders, Koreans, countless Vietnamese soldiers and civilians, and with over 40,000 children of veterans possibly suffering birth defects from herbicidal warfare. Decades later the lingering problem of herbicidal warfare remains as a dominant issue of United States-Vietnam relations. In 2003, a coalition of Vietnamese survivors and long-term victims of Agent Orange sued a number of American-based and multinational chemical corporations for damages related to the manufacture and use of the chemical. A federal judge rejected the suit, claiming that the plaintiff's claim of direct responsibility was invalid.

He was also a Professor of Government, advisor to the State Department, and instrumental in the formation of the United Nations. Early life Kirk was born to a farmer and schoolteacher in Jeffersonville, Ohio. He originally intended to become a foreign correspondent, but fell into educational administration when he served briefly as a high school principal in New Paris, Ohio during his senior year at college. He graduated from Miami University in 1924, earned an M.A. in political science from Clark University in 1925, and studied at the √âcole Libre des Sciences Politiques in 1929 before completing a Ph.D. in the discipline at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1930. While a student at Miami, Kirk became a brother of the founding chapter of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. During his graduate studies, he edited his fraternity's national magazine, The Laurel, to earn money for tuition. He married the former Marion Sands, a schoolteacher and daughter of an official of the B&O; Railroad, in 1925. They raised one son, John Grayson. After receiving his doctorate, Kirk spent the next decade on the faculty of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He completed postdoctoral research at the London School of Economics in 1937.http://search.marquiswhoswho.com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/profile/100002449603 Columbia University Kirk (right) granting an honoris causa degree to Sukarno (1956) In 1940, Kirk was appointed to the faculty of Columbia University as an associate professor of government. He was promoted to full professor in 1943 and began a long association with the U.S. government when he served in the Security Section of the United States Department of State's Political Studies Division during World War II. Kirk became involved in the formation of the United Nations Security Council, attending the Dumbarton Oaks Conference and the United Nations Conference on International Organization where the United Nations Charter was signed. Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Kirk as the University's provost in 1949. In 1951, when Eisenhower took leave to serve as Supreme Commander of NATO, Kirk became acting president of the University. He assumed the presidency in 1953 after Eisenhower was sworn in as President of the United States. During his tenure at Columbia, he quadrupled the University's endowment, added a dozen new buildings to the Morningside Heights campus, and doubled the University library's holdings. However, the University's academic standing gradually eroded during his tenure vis-√†-vis such ascendent institutions as Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, leading Robert McCaughey to characterize the epoch as the \\"afternoon on the Hudson.\\" Kirk's relationship with the student body began to degenerate in the early 1960s as students got caught up in the civil rights and anti-war movements and began to protest openly on campus. In 1959, Kirk started to pursue the construction of a gymnasium suitable for intercollegiate sports competition. Construction was delayed for several years due to lack of funds, during which time community resentment over the University's crowding out its poorer neighbors festered. When construction began in February, 1968, Harlem community activists and civil rights figures protested vigorously enough for the University to fence off the site and post a police guard. Also in 1959, Kirk entered Columbia into its relationship with the Institute for Defense Analyses, which would draw much fire from the anti-war movement, particularly the Students for a Democratic Society, nearly a decade later. The University and Kirk came under fire in 1967 for attempting to patent and promote a \\"healthier\\" cigarette filter developed by New Jersey chemist Robert Louis Strickman.Rosenfeld, Albert. \\"A New Cigarette Filter...a University's Dilemma,\\" LIFE (magazine), July 28, 1967. Questions regarding the filter's effectiveness began to surface just before Kirk was to testify before Congress as to its benefits. On April 23, 1968, student protesters began what would become an eight-day occupation of five university buildings and the president‚Äôs office. Students were protesting the university‚Äôs affiliation with the Institute for Defense Analyses and its plans to construct a new gymnasium in Morningside Park that had one entrance for Columbia students and faculty and another entrance for members of the neighboring West Harlem community, who would not have access to all of the facilities. Kirk initially agreed to address some of the protesters demands, but ultimately filed trespass charges against them and called in police to clear the occupied buildings. After the incident, Kirk resisted calls for his resignation, but stayed away from graduation and eventually announced his retirement before the start of the next academic year. In 1974, a newly-constructed gymnasium finally opened. Later years Grave of Grayson L. Kirk and his wife Marion Sands Kirk at Fairview Cemetery in Jeffersonville, Ohio. After relinquishing the presidency, Kirk completed terms on the Council on Foreign Relations and the Association of American Universities, serving as president of the former organization until 1971. Prior to the 1968 disturbances, Kirk received honorary degrees from a number of institutions, including the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison (1953), Yale University (1953), Harvard University (1954), the University of North Dakota (1958), Bates College (1964) and Waseda University (1965). In addition to serving as president emeritus and trustee emeritus until his death, he remained on Columbia's full-time faculty as the Bryce Professor of History and International Relations (a position he had held since 1959) before retiring in 1973.http://search.marquiswhoswho.com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/profile/100002449603 Kirk died in his sleep at the Plashbourne Estate (where he had resided since 1973) in Yonkers, New York in 1997.

The play took its name from a summer month in the French Republican Calendar, during which the Thermidorian Reaction occurred, overthrowing Robespierre and ending the Reign of Terror. The play was highly controversial and was closed by the authorities, re-opening in March 1896. Maison Maire's owner, Ms. Paillard, created the name of the recipe due to the play's notoriety.

Ford Motor Company, 204 Mich. 459, 170 N.W. 668 (Mich. 1919) is a case in which the Michigan Supreme Court held that Henry Ford had to operate the Ford Motor Company in the interests of its shareholders, rather than in a charitable manner for the benefit of his employees or customers. It is often cited as affirming the principle of \\"shareholder primacy\\" in corporate America. At the same time, the case affirmed the business judgment rule, leaving Ford an extremely wide latitude about how to run the company. In the 1950s and 1960s, states rejected Dodge repeatedly, in cases including AP Smith Manufacturing Co v. Barlow39 ALR 2d 1179 (1953) or Shlensky v. Wrigley., a suit over the decision not to build baseball ground lights to allow games to be played at night-time The general legal position today is that the business judgment that directors may exercise is expansive. Management decisions will not be challenged where one can point to any rational link to benefiting the corporation as a whole. Facts By 1916, the Ford Motor Company had accumulated a capital surplus of $60 million. The price of the Model T, Ford's mainstay product, had been successively cut over the years while the wages of the workers had dramatically, and quite publicly, increased. The company's president and majority stockholder, Henry Ford, sought to end special dividends for shareholders in favor of massive investments in new plants that would enable Ford to dramatically increase production, and the number of people employed at his plants, while continuing to cut the costs and prices of his cars. In public defense of this strategy, Ford declared: While Ford may have believed that such a strategy might be in the long-term benefit of the company, he told his fellow shareholders that the value of this strategy to them was not a main consideration in his plans. The minority shareholders objected to this strategy, demanding that Ford stop reducing his prices when they could barely fill orders for cars and to continue to pay out special dividends from the capital surplus in lieu of his proposed plant investments. Two brothers, John Francis Dodge and Horace Elgin Dodge, owned 10% of the company, among the largest shareholders next to Ford. The Court was called upon to decide whether the minority shareholders could prevent Ford from operating the company for the charitable ends that he had declared. Judgment The Michigan Supreme Court held that Henry Ford could not lower consumer prices and raise employee salaries. Notably, obiter dicta in the opinion written by Russell C. Ostrander argued that the profits to the stockholders should be the primary concern for the company directors. Because this company was in business for profit, Ford could not turn it into a charity. This was compared to a spoliation of the company's assets. The court therefore upheld the order of the trial court requiring that directors declare an extra dividend of $19.3 million. It said the following: Significance As a direct result of this decision, Henry Ford threatened to set up a competing manufacturer as a way to finally compel his adversaries to sell back their shares to him. Subsequently, the money that the Dodge brothers received from the case would be used to expand the Dodge Brothers Company. Ford was also motivated by a desire to squeeze out his minority shareholders, especially the Dodge brothers, whom he suspected (correctly) of using their Ford dividends to build a rival car company. By cutting off their dividends, Ford hoped to starve the Dodges of capital to fuel their growth. In that context, the Dodge decision is viewed as a mixed result for both sides of the dispute. Ford was denied the ability to arbitrarily undermine the profitability of the firm, and thereby eliminate future dividends. Under the upheld business judgment rule, however, Ford was given considerable leeway via control of his board about what investments he could make. That left him with considerable influence over dividends, but not complete control as he wished. This case is frequently cited as support for the idea that corporate law requires boards of directors to maximize shareholder wealth. However, one view is that this interpretation has not represented the law in most states for some time. However, others, while agreeing that the case did not invent the idea of shareholder wealth maximization, found that it was an accurate statement of the law, in that \\"corporate officers and directors have a duty to manage the corporation for the purpose of maximizing profits for the benefit of shareholders\\" is a default legal rule, and that the reason that \\"Dodge v. Ford is a rule that is hardly ever enforced by courts\\" is not that it represents bad case law, but because the business judgement rule means: See also *US corporate law *Grimshaw v.

Administered by the U.S.D.A. Forest Service, it consists of approximately 280,000 acres (1,100 km¬≤) of federally managed lands. In descending order of land area it is located in parts of Pope, Jackson, Union, Hardin, Alexander, Saline, Gallatin, Johnson, and Massac counties.Table 6 - NFS Acreage by State, Congressional District, and County, 30 September 2008 Forest headquarters are located in Harrisburg, Illinois. There are local ranger district offices in Jonesboro and Vienna.USFS Ranger Districts by State The Shawnee National Forest is also the single largest publicly owned body of land in the state of Illinois. It is considered part of Southern Illinois, and is south of the St. Louis, Missouri and Metro-East areas, in Area code 618. Portions of it are in the far south area of Illinois known as Little Egypt. Cities in or near the area are Carbondale, Illinois, Marion, Illinois, and Cairo, Illinois. Designated as the Illini and Shawnee Purchase Units, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared these purchase units to be the Shawnee National Forest in September 1939. Most of the land added to the Forest in its first decade of existence was exhausted farmland. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, the Civilian Conservation Corps planted pine trees to prevent erosion and help rebuild the soil. However, the Forest is also home to many hardwood trees and other plant and animal species characteristic of the region. In the 1980s and 1990s, there was an active history of conservation and protest efforts by local, regional, and national environmental groups and individuals ranging from radical movements such as Earth First! to mainstream organizations such as the Sierra Club and the Green Party. The wise use movement once played an active role in lobbying for its vision of the Shawnee National Forest. Today a more cooperative atmosphere has developed, although some controversy remains with a few. In 2006, the Forest Service completed the development of a new Forest Management Plan for the Shawnee National Forest. This plan, adopted every 10‚Äì15 years, outlines the policies and practices of the U.S. Forest Service in overseeing the management of the Shawnee National Forest. The 2006 Forest Plan was completed in collaboration with many environmental and public groups and is designed to maintain and enhance the forest's unique biodiversity. Geology During the Illinoian Stage (between 352,000 and 132,000 years ago), the Laurentide Ice Sheet covered up to 85 percent of Illinois. The southern margin of this ice sheet was located within what is now the area of the Shawnee National Forest. There are many points of interest marking the southern edge of the glacier. Some are located within the Forest boundary, others are on public land in proximity. Little Grand Canyon is located within the Shawnee National Forest. This is accessible off Illinois Route 127 south of Murphysboro, Illinois. A small creek with a tiny watershed has carved an impressive rock canyon, more than 200 feet deep, leading down to the Big Muddy River. The southern edge of the ice sheet was just to the north of Little Grand Canyon. Blocks of ice slid off the face of the glacier, carried by enormous volumes of meltwater, to carve this tiny canyon. In the deep shade of the canyon are relict species of Arctic plants left over from its ancient origin. Cedar Lake is an artificial lake formed by damming Cedar Creek. The lake is accessible off Illinois Route 127, south of Murphysboro, and off U.S. 51, south of Carbondale. In this area, the Illinoian Glacier climbed the Shawnee Hills at its southern margin. The glacier blocked the waterways flowing north down the hills. This drainage formed a creek running northwest along the face of the glacier. This became Cedar Creek, the watershed of which is extremely asymmetrical. While the watershed extends only a few thousand feet to the south, up the face of the terminal moraine, the creek is also fed by waterways extending miles to the south. Within the area of the Shawnee National Forest, but not at this time US property, is Hicks Dome, an igneous feature in Hardin County, Illinois. This was formerly speculated to be the result of a hot spot, but some argue it was caused by a meteorite impact.

The guerrillas held nearly 60 people, including 15 ambassadors, hostage. Of the initial group, 18 were held captive for 61 days.  Siege  The siege began on the mid-day of February 27, 1980, when seventeen guerrillas dressed in the warm-up clothes of joggers stormed the embassy compound, located in a suburb of Bogot√°. Many diplomats were attending a diplomatic reception celebrating the Dominican Independence Day and consequently were taken hostage. The guerrillas, wielding grenades, AK-47's, wounded five people in the storming of the embassy. One of the guerrillas was killed initially by the police. Within 30 minutes of learning that the Dominican Embassy had been seized, a Colombia task force was established on the State Department's 7th floor. Anthony Quainton, director of the State Department's office for combatting terrorism, was named to head the task force.The Tampa Tribune. Friday, Feb. 29, 1980 Both Colombian National Police, and US Marines occupied strategic positions around the embassy. The hostages included the Papal nuncio to Colombia, Angelo Acerbi, as well as the ambassadors from fourteen countries: Austria, Brazil, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Israel, Mexico, Switzerland, the United States (Diego C. Asencio), Uruguay, and Venezuela. Also among the hostages were diplomats from Bolivia, Jamaica, Paraguay and Peru, and Colombian civilians and workers at the embassy.Los Angeles Times, March 3rd, 1980 The gunmen demanded US$50 million, to be raised from the countries whose diplomats were held hostage. They also sought the release of 311 jailed comrades. Their leader, who called himself \\"Commandante Uno,\\" was later identified as Rosemberg Pab√≥n. Colombian authorities began negotiating with the guerrillas after they threatened to kill the hostages. On February 28, eighteen people, including the Costa Rican ambassador and fourteen other women, were freed by the hostage takers. Five more women were released on February 29. Negotiations gained the release of four cooks and a waiter on March 2. The Austrian ambassador was freed on March 6 out of consideration for his wife, who was in hospital at the time.The Independent Record, Helena, Mont., Thurs. March 6th, 1980 On March 8, the guerrillas reduced their demands to free 311 prisoners to seventy and lowered the amount of money requested to US$10 million. Early on March 17, the Uruguayan ambassador, Fernando Gomez Fyns, escaped from the embassy by jumping from a window and running to troops surrounding the compound. The same day, Fidel Castro offered the guerrillas asylum in Cuba. From March 30 to April 19, the guerrillas released the Costa Rican consul and all of the remaining non-diplomatic hostages. They requested a meeting in Panama with Colombian leaders to resolve the crisis, but were denied by the Colombian government. Their demand for the release of a dozen prisoners was denied, though they were paid US$2.5 million in ransom money. On April 27, the ambassadors from Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Israel, and Egypt were released by the hostage takers, along with two Colombians. The sixteen guerrillas left the embassy with the remaining twelve diplomatic hostages under the supervision of the Inter-American Human Rights Commission of the Organization of American States, and boarded a Cubana Airlines flight to Cuba. They were cheered by many Colombians waiting for them at the airport.

In 963, between the deaths of Romanos and her marriage to Nikephoros, she was regent for her sons, Basil II and Constantine VIII. Theophano historically has been depicted as infamous. Marriage to Romanos II Skyllitzes Matritensis depicting Theophano poisoning her father-in-law, Emperor Constantine VII Theophano was born of Laconian Greek origin in the Peloponnesian region of Lakonia, possibly in the city of Sparta, in 941. Theophano was originally named Anastasia, or more familiarly Anastaso and was the daughter of a poor tavern-keeper called Craterus. Theophano was renowned for her great beauty and heir apparent Romanos fell in love with her around the year 956 and married her against the wishes of his father, Emperor Constantine VII. Theophano's humble origins made her unpopular among Byzantine elites and when her father-in-law Constantine VII died, rumors were spread alleging that she had poisoned him. Constantine died in 959 of a fever which lasted several months, not showing evidence of poisoning. Astute and intelligent, Theophano had influence with her husband, Romanos, an influence resented and likely exaggerated by her rivals in the court. Marriage to Nikephoros II Phokas On March 15, 963, Emperor Romanos II died unexpectedly at the age of twenty-six. Again, Theophano was rumored to have poisoned him, although she had nothing to gain and everything to lose from this action and, indeed, was still in bed only 48 hours after giving birth to Anna Porphyrogenita when the emperor died. Their sons, Basil II and Constantine VIII, five and three years old respectively, were the heirs and Theophano was named regent. However, hereditary ascension was a matter of tradition, not law, and she realized that to protect her sons and secure her position she would need a protector. Passing over a bevy of would be suitors among Constantinople's courtiers, she made an alliance with Nikephoros Phokas. Nikephoros, a physically repulsive ascetic twice her age, was the greatest military hero of the empire at the time, having reconquered Crete, Cyprus, Cilicia, and Aleppo. In return for her hand, the childless Nikephoros gave his sacred pledge to protect her children and their interests. As the army had already proclaimed Nikephoros an emperor in Caesarea, Nikephoros entered Constantinople on August 14, broke the resistance of Joseph Bringas (a eunuch palace official who had become Romanos' chief counsellor) in bloody street fighting. He was crowned on 16 August in the Hagia Sophia, and soon after married Empress Theophano, bolstering his legitimacy. The marriage provoked some clerical opposition as Nikephoros was said to have been godfather to one or more of Theophano's children, which placed them within a prohibited spiritual relationship. In addition, the Orthodox Church only begrudgingly accepted remarriage. The situation was aggravated by the tremendous enmity the arch-conservative Patriarch Polyeuctus felt towards the young upstart empress. Thus, even before the issue of his having been the godfather of at least one of Theophano's children surfaced, Polyeuctus banned Nikephoros from kissing the holy altar on the grounds that he must first perform the penance for remarrying. In the issue of his role as godfather, however, Nikephoros organised a council at which it was declared that since the relevant rules had been pronounced by the iconoclast Constantine V Copronymus, it was of no effect. Polyeuctus did not accept the council as legitimate, and proceeded to excommunicate Nikephoros and insist that he would not relent until Nikephoros put away Theophano. In response, Bardas Phokas and another person testified Nikephoros was not in fact godfather to any of Theophano's children, at which Polyeuctus relented and allowed Nikephoros to return to full communion and keep Theophano as his wife.Norwich, John Julius. Byzantium: The Apogee. New York: Alfred A. Knopf: 1992, p. 192-194 Histamenon of Basil II and Constantine VIII holding a cross Nikephoros' gruff military style proved counterproductive in diplomacy and at court. Soon the empire was at war on multiple fronts, the heavy taxes needed to support the wars were widely unpopular particularly as they coincided with a few years of poor harvests which brought famine. When the emperor tried to relieve the suffering by limiting the wealth of the monasteries, he alienated the church. A widespread conspiracy developed to remove the emperor. On the night of 10 and 11 December 969, his nephew John I Tzimiskes (969‚Äì976) crossed the Bosphorus in a storm, was smuggled into the palace and lowed into the imperial chambers where he woke and killed his uncle. John was good-looking and irrepressibly charming and the contemporary writers record that he and Theophano were lovers. They had come to an understanding on the conspiracy against the emperor. On the night of the assassination Theophano suspiciously left the imperial bedchamber, leaving the doors unbolted. Downfall John now proposed to marry Theophano. However, the empress had by now been too damaged by gossip and rumors. Patriarch Polyeuctus refused to perform the coronation unless John punished those who had assisted him in the assassination, removed the \\"scarlet empress\\" from the court, and repealed all his predecessor's decrees that ran contrary to the interests of the church. John calculated that his legitimacy would be better enhanced by church approval than marriage to the unpopular empress and acceded to the patriarch's demands. Theophano was sent into exile to the island of Prinkipo (sometimes known as Prote). Return to court Following the death of Tzimiskes in January 976, Theophano's teenage sons Basil and Constantine took sole power. One of the emperors' first acts was to recall their mother from exile.Kaldellis, Anthony (2017) Streams of Gold, Rivers of Blood: The Rise and Fall of Byzantium, 955 A.D. to the First Crusade. OUP USA She is last attested in the year 978, appealing to the retired Georgian general T'or'nik of Tao to broker an alliance with his former overlord Davit III of Tao to support her sons against the first revolt of the general Bardas Skleros. This seems to be the last reference to Theophano in any source, and it may be that she died relatively early in the reign of her sons. In literature English author Frederic Harrison wrote Theophano: The Crusade of the Tenth Century (1904), which portrays Theophano as the arch-schemer of Constantinople who manipulated the court to secure her own position in the face of inconstant imperial leadership (the vain and distracted Constantine VII, the drunkard Romanus II, the overly pious Nicephorus Phocas) and thus largely for the good of the state. The Greek historical fiction writer Kostas Kyriazis (b. 1920) wrote a biography called Theophano (1963), followed by the 1964 Basil Bulgaroktonus on her son. As depicted in these books, Theophano was indeed guilty of all the killings attributed to her in her lifetime, and the heritage of a mother who killed both his father and his stepfather caused her son Basil to distrust women and avoid marriage himself.

This system dates to the 1830s.

He had also trained briefly at the Kodokan in Tokyo.\\" Its syllabus comprises atemi-waza (striking techniques), nage-waza (throwing techniques), torae-waza (immobilization methods) and shime-waza (choking techniques). Once a very popular jujutsu system in Japan, among the famous students who studied the art were Kan≈ç Jigor≈ç, whose modern art of judohttp://judoinfo.com/tenshin.htm was greatly inspired by the Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´ and Kit≈ç-ry≈´.  Description  Essentially, Tenjin Shinyo-ryu is the amalgamation of two separate systems of jujutsu: the Y≈çshin-ry≈´ and Shin no Shinto-ryu. The distinctive feature of this particular school is the use of atemi or strikes to disrupt the balance of the opponent as well as a more flexible and flowing movement of the body than seen in some older schools of jujutsu. The older schools employ somewhat larger and slower movements to mimic the use of armour in the battlefield. Tenjin Shinyo-ryu was developed after the period of civil war in Japan; thus, without armor, the movements emphasized were faster and more strikes were incorporated. The strikes were also primarily aimed at human vital points and meridians, which were exposed due to the lack of armor. Like most koryu, the Tenjin Shinyo Ryu follows the bujutsu Menkyo ranking system, as opposed to the budo ky≈´/dan system.  The sources of the art  Shin no Shinto-ryu was created by a palace guard at Osaka castle named Yamamoto Tamiza Hideya who had studied Yoshin-ryu before implementing changes in the curriculum and paring down the system to 68 techniques. Iso Mataemon Masatari (1787‚Äì1863) studied Yoshin-ryu under Hitotsuyanagi Oribe and Shin no Shinto-ryu under Homma Jouemon. He then went traveling and training throughout the country where he engaged in various competitions. It is said that he was never beaten. According to tradition he was once involved in a fight involving a hundred assailants and it was this experience that further solidified the importance of atemi-waza, or striking techniques, in his system along with throwing and strangling techniques common to other systems of jujutsu. Iso created a composite system based on the techniques of the Yoshin-ryu, Shin no Shinto-ryu and his experience and founded his own tradition called the Tenjin Shin'yo ryu around 1800. \\"Tenjin/Tenshin\\" meaning that it was divinely inspired, \\"Shin\\" from Shin no Shinto and \\"yo\\" from the Yoshin-ryu. Iso became the jujutsu instructor to the Tokugawa shogunate and his school flourished to become the most popular school of jujutsu of the time (1848‚Äì1864). Iso taught 5000 students in that time. After the Meiji Restoration of 1868 the study of jujutsu fell into decline generally and this affected the Tenjin Shinyo-ryu as well.  Training methodology  The training methodology, as with most koryu systems, is kata based or a form of pre-arranged fighting. Students learn the specific subtleties, or the more hidden meaning of the form, through the continuous repetitions of the katas. There are over 130 kata of this classical jujutsu, unarmed combat teaching from seated positions, standing positions, weapons defence, and also includes special healing methods and resuscitation (kappo). Certain katas are subject to secrecy, due to the nature of lethal effects and subject of martial traditions. The kappo or resuscitation techniques, were a secret, however Kubota now teaches at K≈çd≈çkan to the leading teachers at the seminars. The higher level of kata, not only relates to the aspect of physical movements, but the deeper inner meanings, or link between the philosophy, and mindset of the practitioner. Such kata are taught only to students with many years of commitment and experience. Tenjin Shinyo-ryu Today With the 5th headmaster, Iso Mataemon dying without designating a successor, the 4th headmaster passed the entire body of knowledge required for full mastery to three Shihans (menkyo kaiden's with impeccable moral character) that were identified and designated as such by the 3rd headmaster (the grandfather of the 5th headmaster), and a fourth as selected by the 4th headmaster to fulfill the \\"divine scheme\\" of transferring the school outside of the family lineage. One of these Shihans, Torijiro Yagi, was able to complete and learn the additional teachings provided to them by the 4th headmaster, and as such is the one and only true and complete lineage of Tenjin Shinyo ryu today. Although there exist a number of individuals who received Menkyo Kaiden awards in the art from legitimate headmasters of the past, none of them have the final \\"keys\\" to be considered as having received the full transmission. Torajiro Yagi passed the full transmission of the body of knowledge to Fusataro Sakamoto, who in turn passed the full transmission of the body of knowledge to the one and only master of the ryu today, Kubota Toshihiro.Summarized from the translation of the \\"Flag Book\\", the original body of knowledge passed to the three Shihan of the 3rd headmaster and written by Iso Mataemon Masanobu (4th Generation Headmaster). Confirmation of this information was provided by Mr. Kubota in response to a 2nd printing of the \\"Flag Book\\", authored by Chiharu Yoshida, the fourth Shihan to receive this body of knowledge and the first to validate its purpose. Moreover, Mr. Kubota speaks of this and other pertinent matters regarding the ryu in Nippon Jujutsu ‚Äì Japan Book of Formal Military Ways, chapter 5. As the leading active teacher is Toshihiro Kubota whose legitimacy in preserving the teachings of his teacher Sakamoto Fusataro is supported by senior exponents of other ko-ry≈´. He formed his dojo and organization, the Tenyokai, in 1978. Receiving instruction in both judo and Tenshin Shinyo ryu from his teacher Sakamoto he received his license in 1973. In his seventies, he still actively participates in the teaching of the art three times a week. Apart from locals, his students are from far ranging countries such as Australia, Germany, Israel, Sweden and England. In addition to Tenjin Shinyo-ryu jujutsu, Kubota holds a 7th dan in judo. A second, although incomplete line of the Tenjin Shinyo ryu traces its lineage through Tobari Kazu who received her training from Tobari Takisaburo. Tobari had in turn studied under Isao Mataichiro, the younger brother of the fourth headmaster of the ryu. She maintained the dual traditions of Tenjin Shinyo Ryu and the Shin no Shinto-ryu until her death some years ago, running a small dojo in Osaka in which many of her students were strong judo players. As this line seems to have become inactive in recent years its survival is cast in some doubt. Miyamoto Hanzo was a student of both Inoue Keitaro and Tozawa Tokusabur≈ç (Êà∏Ê≤¢ Âæ≥‰∏âÈÉé, 1848-1912). Tozawa is believed to have briefly taught jujutsu to aikido founder Ueshiba Morihei. In Miyamoto, who was also very well known as a strong judo man, once again we see the connection between this classical school of jujutsu and modern judo. Miyamoto taught Aimiya Kazusaburo, who himself produced a number of strong students, but after suffering a stroke he was forced to stop teaching the art. Of those students it seems only Shibata Koichi currently continues to teach the art albeit upon a very limited scale. Kan≈ç Jigor≈ç, the founder of judo, studied Tenjin Shinyo jujutsu for several years under two leading exponents of the day, Fukuda Hachinosuke and 3rd generation headmaster Iso Mataemon Masatomo. The Tenshin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´, along with the Kit≈ç-ry≈´, played a role of seminal importance to the development of Kan≈ç's judo system. Although modified for safe sport use, the influence of the Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´ can be seen today in many of judo's core throwing techniques such as seoi nage (shoulder throw), harai goshi (sweeping hip throw) and osoto gari (outer reap) to name but a few. The Itsutsu no kata, or the five forms, of Kodokan judo preserve techniques of an esoteric nature found in the Tenshin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´'s \\"five teachings of the kuden\\" kata and techniques from the Kime no kata are said to show the influence of Tenjin Shin'y≈ç tactics. In this way while creating a modern sport Kano was able to preserve some aspects of the Tenjin Shinyo Ryu in his art and it is for this reason that contemporary judo participants tend to show such an interest in this particular ko-ry≈´ jujutsu form.

The tackler's right hand has grabbed the runner's collar and is using it to pull him down from behind. The horse-collar tackle is an American football maneuver in which a defender tackles another player by grabbing the back collar or the back-inside of an opponent's shoulder pads and pulling the ball carrier directly downward violently in order to pull his feet from underneath him. The technique is most closely associated with Pro Bowl safety Roy Williams. After being blamed for a series of major injuries in the 2004 season, the horse-collar tackle was banned from the NFL during the 2005 off-season. The rule forbidding it is often referred to in the press as \\"The Roy Williams Rule\\". The rule, with modifications, was adopted in college football in 2008 and high school football in 2009. History In the 1981 NFC Championship Game where the Dallas Cowboys visited the San Francisco 49ers, after the 49ers took the lead 28-27 due to \\"The Catch\\", on the Cowboys following drive, Drew Pearson caught a long pass from Danny White at midfield. 49ers cornerback Eric Wright stopped Pearson with a horse-collar tackle (White fumbled on the next play, thus preserving victory for the 49ers and putting them in Super Bowl XVI). Roy Williams was well known for horse-collaring players while playing at Oklahoma, and continued to use the tackle after moving to the NFL in 2002. The horse-collar tackle rose to infamy during the 2004 NFL season, in which it was implicated in six major injuries, four of which were caused by Williams, including two in one game. The injuries that season included broken legs for Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Terrell Owens, Carolina Panthers wide receiver Steve Smith Sr., Baltimore Ravens running back Musa Smith, and Tennessee Titans wide out Tyrone Calico. On May 23, 2005, NFL owners voted 27‚Äì5 to ban the tackle, with the Dallas Cowboys, Detroit Lions, New England Patriots, New Orleans Saints, and San Francisco 49ers voting against. The first year of the ban, only two penalties were called by referees for the horse-collar tackle. Owners voted 25‚Äì7 in 2006 to expand the rule to include tackles by the back of the jersey in addition to tackles by the shoulder pads. Risks The horse-collar is particularly dangerous due to the awkward position of the player being tackled, who will often fall backward in a twisting motion with one or both legs trapped under the weight of his body. This is exacerbated if the player's foot gets caught in the turf and by the additional weight of the defender. Potential injuries include sprains or tears to ligaments in the knees and ankles (including the ACL and MCL), and fractures of the tibia and fibula.Flash illustration of potential horse-collar injuries Smith, for instance, was effectively sidelined for two seasons after a horse-collar tackle by Williams broke his right tibia. The ban states that a horse-collar tackle is an open-field tackle in which a defender uses the shoulder pads or jersey to immediately bring a ball carrier down. The term \\"open field\\" means that horse-collar tackles committed near the line of scrimmage will be allowed. Punishment In the NFL, the horse-collar tackle results in a 15-yard major foul penalty and an automatic first down if committed by the defense, and the penalty is assessed as if it were a dead ball, after the play foul, if the opposing offense gains yards. It will often also result in a league-imposed fine on the player. Roy Williams was the first player suspended for repeated violations of the rule. The one-game suspension was given following a horse-collar tackle on Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb that occurred on December 16, 2007, and it was Williams' third violation of the rule of the 2007 season. The tackle was made illegal in the CFL for the 2007 season. The horse collar tackle was legal through the 2007‚Äì2008 season in college football but was banned by the NCAA after criticism from pundits and coaches for the 2008‚Äì2009 season as part of a package that adopted several NFL rules into the college game.NCAA bans horse- collar tackle from college football The National Federation of State High School Associations added a penalty for horse-collar tackles for the 2009 season.

The name of the facility was changed in March 2002, after the City of Calgary sold the naming rights for 10 million dollars to Talisman Energy for 20 years which was later bought out by Repsol and resulted in another name change. Repsol Sport Centre operates under a dual mandate as directed by The City of Calgary to support both Members and Sport Partner Athletes: *To provide training and competition facilities and services for the development of Calgary's high performance athletes in their respective dryland and aquatic sports. *To provide facilities, programs and services for the wellness and recreational sporting needs of the citizens of Calgary. The complex attracts over 1.8 million visitors annually. The complex itself is run by the non-profit Lindsay Park Sports Society, a 13-member board and Civic Partner of the City of Calgary.  Original structure  Repsol Sport Centre and Elbow Valley The structure itself was built in 1983 for the Western Canada Summer Games. The white inverted v-shaped roof, comprises a steel arch spine with a concrete perimeter. The skin of the roof is a Teflon-coated fibreglass outer skin, that achieves 4% transparency reducing the need for artificial light. The original project cost was $24.7 million. The original facility was opened as area.Alberta Association of Architects - Information on Construction of the Repsol Sport Centre The facility was built at the same time as the Scotiabank Saddledome which is just across Macleod Trail. The project site (between the neighbourhood of Mission and Erlton) was chosen because of easy access to the C-Train that began operation in 1981, and access to the Elbow River pathway.  Major Expansion in 2003-2004  In 2004 Talisman Centre completed a $24 million expansion. The new Fitness Centre is named, Dr. Neville Lindsay Sport Wellness Centre, to commemorate and honour Calgary's first doctor and legendary pioneer who owned the land upon which the facility sits. The new Aquatic Centre is named, The Calgary Foundation Aquaplex, to recognize and celebrate the contributions of The Calgary Foundation through a major gift from an anonymous donor. The facility holds sporting events both professional and amateur, and all facilities are open to the public. Repsol Sport Centre hosts many regional, national and international competitions in water polo, synchronized swimming, swimming, diving, track, basketball and other sports.  On-going expansions  The Talisman Centre has had a few controversies over the years. One was surveillance cameras in sensitive areas, such as change rooms. The presence of cameras throughout the facility was included in the privacy policy.Repsol Sport Centre - Privacy Policy The complex also came under fire when the naming rights were sold to Talisman Energy, some lobby groups claim the oil company is responsible for funding atrocities in Sudan when it primarily did business in the country. These controversies never made an impact on attendance or operations. Other nearby sports facilities in the area are the Stampede Corral, Scotiabank Saddledome, Stampede Grandstand, and Shaw Millennium Park. 2013-2014 Facility Improvements On June 20, 2013, Talisman Centre was forced to evacuate and close the entire facility as one of the worst natural disasters in Alberta's history, the June Flood, hits Calgary. The flood caused close to $10 million in damages including restoration, repairs and, in most cases, brand new equipment was brought in to replace flood-infected air ducts, and beyond-repair mechanical machinery and electrical equipment. As well, administrative files and other program gear was damaged along with numerous fitness machines broken down from the lack of air flow during the closure. Talisman Centre is continuing to work with The City of Calgary and its insurance company to replace all items, with new fitness and cardio equipment arriving by the end of the year. New lower level activity spaces include: Multi-Sport 1 Studio, Multi-Sport 2 Studio, and Strength & Balance (Yoga & Pilates) Studio.  Roof Replacement  The original tensile roof on the Repsol Sport Centre was constructed in 1983 and remained in service longer than anticipated. After a two-year review regarding options for the existing roof, City Council approved funding for a new-and-improved roof system. While maintaining the original roof's profile, the new roof system made use of new materials such as Nanogel aerogel thus providing better insulation and energy efficiency while also allowing a significant amount of light to filter into the building's interior.Canadian Consulting Engineer Magazine - Repsol Sport Centre in Calgary Renovated with Gel RoofBirdair Project Gallery 2010 ‚Äì In March, the tented portion of the facility is closed for the replacement of its roof and many facility upgrades.

It is sponsored by a chapter of the Ruritans, a community service organization which was founded in the small town of Holland about 30 miles to the southeast. Ostensibly an event to celebrate the James River running of shad, at a shad planking, the oily, bony fish are smoked for the occasion on wood planks over an open flame. The events held near Wakefield began after World War II, and were long a function of the state's Conservative Democrats, whose political machine dominated Virginia politics for about 80 years from the late 19th century until the 1960s. However, both Virginia and the Shad Planking had evolved into a more bipartisan environment by the 1980s. In modern times, would-be candidates, reporters, campaign workers, and locals gather to eat shad, drink beer, smoke tobacco, and kick off the state's electoral season with lighthearted speeches by politicians in attendance. Sponsored by the Wakefield Ruritan Club, Shad Planking serves as the organizations primary fundraising event for the year. All of the funds raised from the event are invested within the Wakefield Community and support such community organizations as baseball teams, the fire department, and other groups. The name \\"The Shad Plank\\" was adopted by the political blog of the Daily Press newspaper based in Newport News. History The traditional event was originally a tribute to the start of the fishing season. The planking dates to the 1930s near Smithfield, Virginia, beginning as a small gathering of friends to celebrate the James River running of shad‚Äîthe oily, bony fish smoked for the occasion on wood planks over an open flame. The unique shad cooking technique that is enjoyed today traces its roots to Mr. Paul Cox, of Surry County, Virginia. Mr. Cox, along with several Ruritans including Dr. E.C. Nettles and Mr. Richard Savedge, invited twenty-five of their friends to historic Wrenn's Mill in Isle of Wight County, Virginia for their first Shad Planking. Having attended similar functions in the deep South, Mr. Cox introduced the group to the intriguing process of cooking 15 shad they had caught earlier in the day from the James River on hardwood planks over an open fire. With Dr. Nettles' suggestion and help, the Wakefield Ruritan Club later adopted this time honored tradition as an annual community and fund raising function in 1949. The event has been held on the third Wednesday in April each year ever since to herald the arrival of spring, with attendance increasing in size from the original 300 guests to over 2000 today. The site is the wooded property of a sportsmen's club near U.S. Route 460 near the incorporated town of Wakefield in Sussex County, about an hour southeast of the Virginia State Capitol at Richmond. Originally a purely social affair, it soon gained a political function, a development credited to State Senator Garland Gray, a local lumberman. In its early years, Democratic party bosses used the Shad Planking (event) as an opportunity to select the next governor. Harry F. Byrd, Sr. and the Byrd Organization dominated Virginia politics into the 1960s. In his 1977 novel, \\"The Shad Treatment,\\" legal scholar, novelist, and journalist Garrett Epps called the event \\"a yearly gathering of the white men in Southside [Virginia] -- no blacks, no women allowed -- where the shirt-sleeve politicians . . . gathered to look over the political leadership.\\" That has changed and all are welcome now. Many think that in 1977, then-state State Senator L. Douglas Wilder (D) became the first black to attend. Also that year, Washington Post reporter Megan Rosenfeld was the first woman to attend. Over the years, the gathering has evolved into a political gossip festival‚Äîa place for candidates to see and be seen and for the curious to speculate about the likely winners and losers of the year's coming campaign season. As Virginia became more Republican after the decline of the Byrd Organization, by the late 20th century, the event became dominated by Republicans. In recent years, especially as the Republicans lost power again after the gubernatorial administration of Jim Gilmore, the Shad Planking has seen substantial representation by all parties, including the Libertarian Party. =Recent events=2005 Republican gubernatorial candidate Jerry Kilgore and his Democratic opponent Tim Kaine spoke at the 2005 Shad Planking. Virginia State Senator Russ Potts was not allowed to speak, so his supporters passed out stickers, \\"Let Russ Speak\\". Potts had a bluegrass band \\"Lagerhead\\" from Winchester play at his tent. \\"Go Russ Go\\" Pott's campaign song was played live at the Shad Planking. 2006 The featured speaker was Attorney General Bob McDonnell. 2007 Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling, wearing a Virginia Tech tie, was the main speaker. The colors of Virginia Tech were on display, with many attendees wearing Virginia Tech hats and t-shirts, since the event occurred two days after the Virginia Tech massacre. Rather than giving a political speech, Bolling focused on the events at Virginia Tech. Bolling's son graduated from Virginia Tech in 2006. 2008 The 60th annual shad planking was held on April 16, the first anniversary of the Virginia Tech massacre and coincided with the reconvened session of the Virginia General Assembly. The featured speakers were the candidates for Virginia's open U.S. Senate seat, Mark Warner, the Democratic candidate, and Republican contenders Del. Robert G. Marshall and former governor Jim Gilmore. Each candidate opened with comments on the first anniversary of the Virginia Tech Massacre. Warner spoke of bipartisan cooperation and pledged to become a \\"radical centrist\\" if elected. Marshall, who was facing Gilmore for the Republican Party nomination, emphasized his conservative voting record and strong stance against abortion and gay marriage. He also highlighted his role leading the legal challenge to the regional transportation authorities in Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia. Gilmore emphasized his connection to John McCain and Warner's connection to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. He characterized Warner as an untrustworthy, \\"tax-and-spend\\" liberal who wanted to set a withdrawal date for the war in Iraq. 2009 Wet weather early in the day cleared up before start time but there was a smaller than expected crowd. The featured speakers were the 2009 candidates for governor: Republican Bob McDonnell and Democratic contenders Brian Moran and Terry McAuliffe. 2010 George Allen speaking at the 2010 Shad Planking event Because of a light rain continuing almost up to time for the speeches to start, the crowd was small. The featured speaker was former United States Senator and former Governor of Virginia George Allen. 2012 An April 20 editorial in The Roanoke Times noted the event's lack of Democrats, but said that didn't mean it was dead: \\"The only debate possible is over exactly which year the Shad Planking went too far. Was it 2005, when a campaign worker in a duck costume was escorted off the premises by police after complaints that he was being disorderly? Or 2009, when former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe hogged the camera after spotting a crew from the Sean Hannity Show? No matter which theory you believe, most everyone agrees that Virginia's bony little shad long ago jumped the shark.\\" 2016 2016 brings three major changes to the event: * The introduction the Grapes and Grains Festival - a showcase of Virginia's best wines * The creation of the Presidential Straw Poll - a fun and newsworthy way for Virginia to help shape the national political landscape * The event day is moved from the 3rd Wednesday in April to the following Friday. In 2016, it is on Friday, April 22.

He was known as Pappachan in his childhood, and was officially known as P. J. Joseph. He went to school at Holy Family LP School and St. Peter‚Äôs UP School, and then at St. Berchmans‚Äô High School in Changanacherry. He attended St. Berchmans' College, Changanacherry for a B.A. Economics and Loyola College, Chennai from which he received an M.A. in economics.  Priestly ministry  Powathil did his seminary studies in St. Thomas Seminary Changanacherry and Papal Seminary Pune. He was ordained priest on 3 October 1962. He was appointed auxiliary bishop of Changanacherry (Titular Bishop of Caesarea Philippi) on 29 January 1972, despite having little Episcopal experience, and was consecrated by Pope Paul VI on 13 February 1972. On 26 February 1977, a new diocese was created under the name Kanjirappally, splitting the Changanacherry archdiocese. Bishop Powathil was transferred there as the first bishop. He served the new diocese for nine years. He rose to become archbishop and returned to Changanacherry on 16 November 1985, succeeding Mar Antony Padiyara. As the Archbishop of Changanacherry, Powathil pushed for the restoration of East Syriac traditions in the Syro-Malabar Church. He fought for the complete revival of the Divine Liturgy that was latinised after the Synod of Diamper1599, although it was partially revived after Vatican II. These efforts got him several critics even among his fellow bishops, alleging that what he espoused amounted to adoption of Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church practices. On 22 January 2007, Powathil resigned in conformity with Canon 210 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. On the same day, it was announced that Auxiliary Bishop of Changanacherry, Mar Joseph Perumthottam, would succeed Powathil in the office as the Archbishop of Changanacherry.

Germain Pilon (c. 1525 ‚Äì 3 February 1590)Connat & Colombier 1951; Thirion 1996. was a French Renaissance sculptor. Biography He was born in Paris and trained with his father, Andre Pilon. Documents show that he and his father executed several religious statues and tomb effigies in collaboration. Since Connat & Colombier established that Germain was born c. 1525 (rather than about ten years later, as previously believedBabelon reports that in 1583 Germain Pilon said he was \\"forty-six or thereabouts\\" and gives c. 1537 for his year of birth (Babelon 1927, p. 33). Connat & Colombier say that Babelon's date of 1583 is incorrect; the cited document is dated 15 May 1581, from which his year of birth would be calculated as c. 1535.), several early works have been reattributed to him, including the marble grouping Diana with a Stag (originally at the Ch√¢teau d'Anet, Eure-et-Loir; now at the Louvre).Diana with a Stag was formerly attributed to Jean Goujon, but Anthony Blunt conclusively rejected that attribution in 1953 and argued the statue is very likely an early work of Germain Pilon (see Blunt & Beresford 1999, pp. 80‚Äì81). Thirion considers Blunt's reattribution to be relatively convincing (Thirion 1996, p. 812). Later he worked with Pierre Bontemps.Thirion 1996, p. 812. Pilon became expert with marble, bronze, wood and terra cotta. From about 1555 he was providing models for Parisian goldsmiths.Babelon 1927. He was also skilled at drawing. His works - with their realism and theatrical emotion - show the influence of the School of Fontainebleau, Michelangelo and Italian Mannerism. Germain at first had an Italian influence. Much of Pilon's work was on funerary monuments, especially the Valois Chapel at the Saint Denis Basilica designed by Francesco Primaticcio (never completed). He was the favorite sculptor of queen Catherine de' Medici. He was the son of Andre Pilon and Jeanne Becque. He was married twice, to Germaine Durand and Madeleine Beaudoux. He had 11 children: Jean, Rapha√´l, Germain Junior, Gervais, Claude, Jeanne, Lucrece, Charlotte, Suzanne, Anthoine, and Philippe. Works Pilon's most famous works include: * Eight subsidiary statues for the Tomb of Francis I (contracted with Philibert de l'Orme, 1558). * Monument containing the heart of Henry II of France (1561‚Äì1562) Louvre - made in collaboration with Domenico del Barbieri (who designed the pedestal), Pilon was responsible for the eloquent sculpture of the Three Graces, executed from a single block of marble. The king's heart was placed in a bronze urn held by the Three Graces, but this urn was destroyed during the French Revolution and has been replicated.Victoria L. Goldberg, \\"Graces, Muses, and Arts: The Urns of Henry II and Francis I\\" Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 29 (1966), pp. 206-218. * Tomb of Henry II and Catherine de' Medici (1561‚Äì1573) Abbey Church of Saint Denis Basilica - Pilon was responsible for the kneeling bronze figures on top of this monument (depicting the king and queen alive and praying) the moving and realistic recumbent figures of the queen and king in death at the center and the four Virtues at the corners of the monument, the construction of which was supervised by Francesco Primaticcio (who sculpted the four corner figures). (Catherine de' Medici is reported to have fainted at the sight of these figures.) * Effigies of Henry II and Catherine de' Medici in coronation dress (1583) Abbey Church of Saint Denis Basilica - this later pair lacks the emotional intensity of the previous work * Resurrection of Christ and recumbent figures of the guardians of the tomb, reunited in 1933 at the Mus√©e du Louvre. * Virgin of Pity (c.1585) (terra cotta) Louvre * Tomb of Valentine Balbiani (1574) Louvre * Descent from the Cross (1580‚Äì1585) (Bronze bas-relief) Louvre * Three Fates (H√¥tel de Cluny, Paris).

Psychologists have researched attraction toward trans women, cross dressers, non-binary people, and a combination of these. Cisgender men attracted to transgender women primarily identify as heterosexual and sometimes as bisexual, but rarely as homosexual. Sexual arousal research has confirmed that their response patterns are unlike those of gay men and resemble those of heterosexual men, except that they are highly aroused by transgender women in addition to cisgender women. They show little arousal to men. A substantial proportion of cisgender men attracted to transgender women report also experiencing autogynephilia, sexual arousal in response to the image of themselves as female. There has been some discussion of attraction to trans men, but it has not yet been the topic of scientific study. Scientific study Despite being referred to as a paraphilia by several researchers, having a sexual preference for transgender people is neither diagnosable as a mental illness nor as a paraphilic disorder.American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.). Washington, DC. In 1993, Ray Blanchard and Peter Collins conducted an analysis of 119 profiles in a voicemail-based personal ad system of people seeking romantic or sexual partners and indicating an interest in cross-dressing or cross-dressers. The analysis revealed three groups: 42.9% were gynandromorphophiles, who \\"sought cross-dressers, transvestites, transsexuals,\\" or individuals with both \\"male primary and female secondary sexual characteristics\\"; 31.1% were gynandromorphophilic cross-dressers, who identified themselves as transvestites or engaged in cross-dressing and sought partners who did the same; and 26.1% were residual cross-dressers, who identified themselves as transvestites or engaged in cross-dressing, but sought \\"masculine\\" men or did not specify their desired type of partner. In their sociological study, Martin S. Weinberg and Colin J. Williams interviewed 26 men sexually interested in transwomen (MSTW). Thirteen identified themselves as heterosexual, and 13 as \\"bisexual or probably bisexual.\\" The authors opined \\"These labels only superficially describe their sexual interest,\\" and noted that the expressed interest in trans women was sometimes used as a basis for denying a more stigmatized self-identity. As an example, they described a case who \\"said that he was 'bisexual' rather than 'gay' because he was able to think of the transwomen as women\\". As part of HIV prevention research in 2004, Operario et al. interviewed 46 men in the San Francisco area who had sex with transgender women, but found \\"no consistent patterns between how men described their sexual orientation identity versus their sexual behavior and attraction to transgender women\\". Of the sample, 20 of them described themselves as being straight or heterosexual. Some men were definitive about this declaration, while others were hesitant and wondered if they should consider themselves bisexual. A Northwestern University study recruited 205 men interested in trans women. In that online survey, 51% identified as straight, 41% as bisexual, and the remainder as gay. Also, 55% said their ideal partner would be a cisgender female, and 36% said it would be a trans woman. The study authors concluded that \\"The interest in trans women appears to be a distinct sexual interest separate from heterosexual men‚Äôs attraction to women for the majority of men, but there is a substantial minority who may experience it as their sexual orientation.\\" A 2016 study that used the penile plethysmograph demonstrated that the arousal patterns, genital and subjective, of men who report attraction to transgender women who have \\"female-typical physical characteristics (e.g. breasts) while retaining a penis\\" are similar to those of straight men and different from those of gay men. The study showed that these men are much more aroused to female than to male stimuli. They differed from both the groups of straight and gay men, however, in also displaying strong arousal to stimuli featuring trans women, to which they responded as much as to the cisgender female stimuli. The study also found that autogynephilia is common in this group: 42% of the study group reported experiencing autogynephilic arousal, whereas only 12% of straight men and 0% of gay men did. Of the men attracted to trans women, 41.7% identified as bisexual, with the remainder identifying as straight. The bisexuals among them did not display significantly more arousal to male stimuli than their heterosexual counterparts, however. They did report a higher number of male sex partners, and they had higher levels of self-reported autogynephilic arousal than their straight counterparts. Sexual arousal was also measured in another study, comparing the responses of four groups of people: autogynephilic male cross-dressers, gynandromorphophilic men, heterosexual men, and homosexual men. The penile reactions of the study participants were recorded while watching nine 3-minute film clips (with audio): two neutral (natural scenery with soothing music) and seven showing pairs of individuals engaged in oral and penetrative sex. In these seven, two had cisgender male actors only, two had cisgender female actors only (with fingering as the penetrative sex), and three had transgender women who had breasts and a penis as actors: a trans woman and a man, a trans woman and a cis woman, and a trans woman with another trans woman. Their responses replicated the finding that gynandromorphophilic men are distinct from gay men; the responses of the gynandromorphophiles were not distinguishable from those of the autogynephilic male crossdressers, however. These two groups showed little response to the cisgender male-only stimuli, large response to the cisgender female-only stimuli, but largest response to transgender female stimuli. The responses of the gay men and the heterosexual men both showed the expected patterns of most arousal to cisgender males and females respectively, little to the non- preferred sex, and only some to the trans female actors.Hsu, K. J., Rosenthal, A. M., Miller, D. I., & Mailey, J. M. (2017). Sexual arousal patterns of autogynephilic male cross-dressers. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 46, 247-253. doi:10.1007/s10508-016-0826-z Social views According to Jeffrey Escoffier of the Centre for Gay and Lesbian Studies of CUNY, sexual interest in trans women first emerged in 1953, associated with the then famous transition of Christine Jorgensen. Erotic materials created for people attracted to trans men have become more visible, especially due to pornographic actor Buck Angel.Richardson, Niall (2010). Transgressive Bodies: Representations in Film and Popular Culture. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. Trans activist Jamison Green writes that cisgender gay men who are partnered with trans men \\"are often surprised to find that a penis is not what defines a man, that the lack of a penis does not mean a lack of masculinity, manliness, or male sexuality.\\" Gay author Andrew Sullivan has criticized the idea that gay men should necessarily be attracted to trans men, arguing that sexual orientation is based on biological sex, not gender identity. Terminology A variety of casual terms have developed to refer to people who are attracted to transgender people. These terms include admirer, trans-attracted, trans-oriented, transfan, and trans catcher. The terms transamorous and transsensual have also emerged, but they have not seen much usage. The terms tranny chaser (sometimes shortened to chaser) and tranny hawkBaker, Paul (2004). Fantabulosa: A Dictionary of Polari and Gay Slang. Continuum International Publishing Group, have been used, although tranny is considered a slur by many.Staff report (4 January 2010). Paper guilty of transsexual slur. BBC NewsLennard, Natasha (7 April 2010). Transgender Film Draws Protests at Festival Site. The New York Times The term chaser is predominantly used to describe men sexually interested in trans women, but it is sometimes used to refer to those interested in trans men as well. Transgender people themselves often use the term in a pejorative sense, because they consider chasers to value them for their trans status alone, rather than being attracted to them as a person. However, some claim this term in an affirming manner. Sociologist Avery Tompkins of Transylvania University in Kentucky argued in an article in the Journal of Homosexuality that a sex- positive trans politics cannot emerge if terms such as tranny chaser informed discussion of attraction to transgender people. In scientific literature, the term gynandromorphophilic is often used for men who are attracted to trans women who possess a combination of male and female physical characteristics. The term skoliosexual has been used to describe attraction to non-binary people. The terms pansexual and polysexual may be used to indicate that gender variant people are among the types of people that one is attracted to.

Designed by Larry Albert of Albert & Associates Architects, the library is located within the Beauvoir historical site in Biloxi, Mississippi, United States.  Facilities  The library's Rotating Exhibit Gallery The presidential library has the stated purpose of preserving, housing and making available the official papers, records, artifacts and other historical materials of Jefferson Davis. Despite the name, it is not administered by the National Archives and Records Administration, as Jefferson Davis was never president of the United States. It is, however, supported by the State of Mississippi, as is described on a plaque at the library entrance. The library is managed by the Mississippi Division, S.C.V., and features continually changing temporary exhibits and a permanent exhibit covering Jefferson Davis's life. On August 29, 2005, the first Jefferson Davis presidential library suffered heavy damage from the fierce wind and water of Hurricane Katrina. The library pavilion, the Hayes Cottage, the Soldiers Home barracks replica, the Confederate Soldiers Museum, the gift shop, and director's home were totally destroyed. Artifacts were photographed, inventoried, boxed and placed in environmental storage while conservation of the items and Beauvoir Historic Site were under way. On January 9, 2007, a bid of $4.1 million was taken to rebuild the library and museum. Because of hurricane damage, renovation of the original Jefferson Davis presidential library was deemed impossible; consequently, the newly rebuilt library was rededicated and opened to the public on June 3, 2013. The Federal Emergency Management Agency paid $4 million to repair Beauvoir and an additional $10 million to construct the new library. The William Beckwith statue of Davis that once graced the rotunda of the library now stands near the entrance, along with a statue by Gary Casteel that was added in 2009.

The first single and only music video shot was for \\"When You're On Top.\\" Although the album contains some profanity (in \\"Everybody Out of the Water\\"), it does not carry the Parental Advisory sticker.

It was originally released as an adult game for Windows on January 30, 2004. It was subsequently followed by an all-ages release for the PlayStation 2 (PS2) and an expanded adult release for Windows. The Windows version was localized in English by MangaGamer in 2009, and the PS2 version was localized in English by YumeHaven in 2016 on Steam. The gameplay in Shuffle! follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios and courses of interaction and focuses on the appeal of the female main characters. Shuffle! has been re-made into an expanded version called Shuffle! Essence+. It has expanded routes for the original five main heroines as well as new routes for six other characters. Shuffle! also has three spin-off sequels: Tick! Tack!, Really? Really! and Shuffle! Love Rainbow. Shuffle! has made several transitions to other media. There have been two manga series based on the visual novel. The first was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's magazine Comptiq between December 2003 and 2006. The second was a comic anthology published by Kadokawa Shoten between July 2004 and December 2005. Two anime adaptations were produced by the animation studio Asread. The first anime was twenty-four episodes in length and was broadcast in Japan between July 2005 and January 2006. The second series was a twelve- episode readaptation and was broadcast between January and March 2007. Seven light novels, two fanbooks, nine drama CDs, and seven radio drama CDs adaptations have also been produced. The visual novel was well received whereas the first anime adaptation received mixed reviews. Across the national semi-monthly ranking of bish≈çjo games in amount sold in Japan, the limited edition of Shuffle! premiered in second place at the time of its release and remained in the top 50 for an additional three and a half-months. The normal edition premiered in ninth place at the time of its release and remained in the top 50 for an additional three half-months. Critics of the anime series were divided between whether or not the anime series set itself apart from other series in the harem genre and as to the quality of its audio and visual aspects. Gameplay Example of what average conversation looks like in Shuffle! Here, Rin is talking with Asa. The gameplay mostly consists of reading and listening to the conversations provided. Every now and then, a \\"Please Select Your Destiny\\" event will occur, giving the player multiple choices on how to respond. The choices selected determine who will be Rin's destined love; depending on which route the player takes, there will be between 8 and 12 multiple-choice questions. At a certain point in the visual novel, a translucent image of the destined character appears when the day changes indicating who Rin has fallen in love with after which the multiple- choice events become almost nonexistent. Near the end of the game, two sex scenes will occur. After some more conversation the visual novel ends. After the visual novel has been completed at least once, players can view CG (computer graphics) artwork they have observed, skip to scenes or endings for characters they have viewed, and listen to music they have heard in the game. The PlayStation 2 version varies from the PC version as all the sex scenes are removed and the player may follow two new storylines: Mayumi Thyme's and Kareha's. Additionally, Kareha's younger sister Tsubomi makes her first appearance in the PS2 version during Kareha's path. Shuffle! Essence+ allows the player to follow the storylines of seven heroines, including four new storylines: Tsubomi's, Sakura Yae's, Nadeshiko Benibara's and Daisy's. In Daisy's path, Erica Suzuran makes her first appearance as a secondary character and Ruri Matsuri appears as the second main heroine, but she does not have any sex scenes. PlotSetting and themes= The story takes place in a fictional universe where humans live in harmony with gods, resembling humans with slightly pointed ears, and devils (demons in the English dub of the anime), who have more prominently pointed ears. Despite their respective positive and negative connotations, both races are equally kind and good-natured. Ten years prior to the story, the gateway between the worlds of the gods and devils were opened, and since then, people from all races have been immigrating between the worlds. The characters attend the multi-racial high school, in . This is so humans, gods and devils can interact and learn to live together in harmony with mutual understanding rather than hatred, fear and ignorance. Also, due to dimensional tears, whose appearances are never fully explained, some members of each race had been transported to one of the other worlds where they married and had children. This is how some of the students with mixed lineage are able to be older than the gateway to the human world like Mayumi Thyme, whose human parent had fallen into the world of the Devils through one of those tears years before the gateway to the Human world had been opened, or Asa's mother, Ama Shigure, who somehow was transported from the world of the Devils to the Human world. Shuffle! contains a leitmotif of allusions to flowers. All of the characters' names are references to flowers in some way, mostly genera of flowering plants. =Main characters= The protagonist and player character of Shuffle! is Rin Tsuchimi, a normal seventeen-year-old second-year high school student and the male protagonist to the series. Since a young age, he has placed the well- being of others before his own and dislikes seeing people in sorrow. Since he lost his parents in his childhood, he has been living with Kaede Fuyou, a life envied by many of his classmates. One of the heroines of Shuffle!, Kaede believes it her duty in life is to take care of Rin, which she takes upon herself in order to atone for her treatment of him in the past and bears a one-sided love towards Rin. Kaede appears again as the heroine in Really? Really!, a sequel to Shuffle!, that continues from Kaede's ending in Shuffle!. In middle school, the two meet and later befriend Asa Shigure, another heroine of Shuffle! who is in her third-year of high school. While she has a weak constitution, she makes up for it with her energetic tomboy personality and is an excellent cook. She has a habit of slapping Rin on his back. CG art scene of Kareha and Tsubomi that appears in Shuffle! On the Stage. For this screenshot, the text has been hidden to allow for an unobstructed view of the art, a common feature of visual novels. At the onset of the story, two girls who Rin had met once during his childhood come to his school as transfer students and began living as his next door neighbours. Lisianthus, a heroine of Shuffle!, is an energetic and enthusiastic person who is able to start a conversation with anyone. She comes to the human world as a possible marriage candidate for Rin and as the daughter of the Lord of Gods, thankful for his kindness to her in the past. Similarly, Nerine, who is also a heroine, is a reserved girl with a beautiful voice and a capable user of magic. She also comes to the human world to be a marriage candidate for Rin as the daughter of the Lord of Devils. Nerine appears again as a heroine in Navel's game, Tick! Tack!, which continues from Nerine's ending. Soon after the two daughters come to his school, Rin meets Primula, a strange, soft-spoken girl who often carries a stuffed cat around. There are two new storylines that are available in the PlayStation 2 version of the game. Mayumi Thyme is a heterochromia-eyed girl who is half-devil and half-human. She is Rin's classmate and is always searching for news. She takes pride in her smallest bust size, a fact often made fun of by Rin and Itsuki, claiming them to be a rarity sought after by a select group of men. Kareha is of the god race and is Asa's friend and classmate who enjoys making sweets and taking on related part-time jobs. Whenever she sees something romantic or cute, she has a habit of saying \\"Ma Ma Maa!\\" and starts to daydream, losing awareness of her surroundings. In Shuffle! Essence+, there are four new storylines available in the game. Tsubomi is Kareha's younger sister, and like Kareha, she has a tendency to space out when she see something romantic or cute. Her catchphrase is \\"Kya! Kya! Kya!\\". She's the same age as Primula, so they easily become friends. Sakura is Rin's and Kaede's childhood friend, they know each other since elementary school. That's why she knows about Rin's and Kaede's tragic past. Nadeshiko is Rin's homeroom teacher. She's quite self-confident, firmly stepping on the ground, single, attractive and is frequently the victim of pickup lines, including from the Lord of Devils and Itsuki. It appears she has some martial arts training (being able to slice a bottle with her bare hand). She has a habit of dealing out very strong punishments such as writing 100-page reports and dragging a tire around the track for minor offenses. However when it comes speak about romantic relationship or cuteness she can become shy, specially when someone speaks so about her. Daisy is Sia's cousin. When they were kids they used to play a lot together, but because of some circumstances between their fathers both of them stopped playing together. Daisy remember the precious for her time she spend with Lisianthus, but Sia seems to forgotten the old days, when they were together. =Story= The storyline of Shuffle! follows the life of Rin Tsuchimi, a normal seventeen- year-old second-year high school student who finds himself sought after by a variety of girls. Eight years prior to the onset of the story, he lost his parents in a car accident that also took the life of Kaede Fuyou's mother. From that point onwards, he began living with her. At around the same time he lost his parents, he met Lisianthus and Nerine at different times who each were accompanying their fathers on a diplomatic business in the human world. Each girl became lost after wandering through the human world. During that time, Rin befriended each girl after playing with them for a day. As a result of his kindness, Rin finds himself as the potential marriage candidate for both Lisianthus and Nerine, the daughters of the king of the gods and king of the demon worlds, who recently transfer to Rin's school at the onset of the story.

Asa Shigure ranked as the 14th most popular heroine with Kaede Fuyou ranking 15th. =Anime= Shuffle! the anime television series received mixed reviews from critics. Theron Martin of Anime News Network described the anime as although \\"genuinely enjoyable\\", often \\"alternating between brazen stupidity, lame jokes, and disgusting sweetness\\" criticizing it as being a typical harem anime that offered little new content. Helen Ellingwood of Active Anime disagreed stating that Shuffle! contained what she described as the most important ingredient, which sets it apart from other harem anime: \\"heart\\". Anime News Network's Carlo Santos agreed with Martin's assessment, agreeing with the show's lack of novelty and stating that the highlight of the anime is its comedy, but that its romance is \\"slowly running the series into the ground.\\" However, D. F. Smith of IGN stated that it actually does well against other harem anime as it \\"may be ridiculous, exploitative, a simultaneous affront to good sense and good taste, but at least it's good for a chuckle or two\\". Smith criticized the ending for lacking \\"intensity\\"; however, Ellingwood praised it for showing the consequences of avoiding which heroine the protagonist would choose to love, unlike harem anime she had prior. Ellingwood praised the animation quality as \\"high quality\\" with \\"wonderfully lush and vibrant color schemes\\" used for the character designs. Smith agreed, describing the anime as \\"colorful\\" and \\"sharply-drawn\\", however in the last few episodes as having darkened the scenes a little excessively. However, Martin criticized the \\"mediocre\\" animation noting the \\"bland\\" appearance of characters as uncharacteristic of harem anime. Santos stated that the animation was \\"sloppy\\" for the secondary characters, however praised the high quality and detail of the artwork. Although Ellingwood described the score as \\"energetic and pleasing\\", Smith stated that the music \\"tends to stick to the background\\". Martin expressed a similar view stating that the soundtrack \\"does little to spruce up the production\\", although he described the opening theme \\"You\\" as \\"a strong, energetic J-rock number worth listening to independently\\" and as \\"unquestioningly\\" the highlight of the soundtrack. On the other hand, Santos described the theme music and at times the music selection as \\"show[ing] absolutely no originality\\" but the background music as \\"surprisingly listenable\\" and at times \\"so evocative that it conveys the scene better than the story and characters do.\\" =Legacy= A 3D virtual world called Ai Sp@ce was developed by the video game developer Headlock where users can interact with bish≈çjo game heroines from Shuffle!, Clannad, and Da Capo II. Released in October 2008, the world recreates each game franchise on its own virtual island which are linked with a central Akihabara Island where users can interact, bridging the gap between the separate franchises. Users are able to create a customizable avatar to represent themselves in the game, along with choosing one game heroine to live with, which is referred to as a character doll, or chara-doll for short. The user and chara-doll reside together on one of the three in-game \\"islands\\" depending on which franchise the heroine is from, which includes a house with furniture and clothes that can be purchased. The chara-dolls can also be customizable in that they can develop a unique personality for each user. It has been announced that there will be a sequel to Shuffle! titled Shuffle! Episode 2.

She is co-director of the Pearl Project, a faculty- student, investigative-reporting project into the kidnapping and murder of her former colleague, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. Nomani is the author of two books: Standing Alone: An American Woman's Struggle for the Soul of Islam and Tantrika: Traveling the Road of Divine Love. Articles include: \\"Islamic Bill of Rights for Women in the Bedroom\\", the \\"Islamic Bill of Rights for Women in the Mosque\\", and \\"99 Precepts for Opening Hearts, Minds and Doors in the Muslim World\\". She has also written for The Washington Post and has been a returning guest on Real Time with Bill Maher. Her story forms part of the documentary The Mosque in Morgantown, aired nationwide on PBS as part of the series America at a Crossroads. Early life Nomani was born in Bombay (now Mumbai), India to parents following Sunni Islam. When she was four years old, she moved to the United States with her older brother to join their parents in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Her father, Zafar Nomani, was earning a PhD at Rutgers University. When Nomani was ten, her family moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, where her father became an assistant professor of nutrition. Her father (cited as M.Z.A. Nomani) published studies on the health effects of fasting during Ramadan and also helped organize mosques in both New Jersey and West Virginia. Nomani received her B.A. in Liberal Studies from West Virginia University in 1986 and M.A. from American University in International Communications in 1990. Career Nomani is a former The Wall Street Journal correspondent and has written for The Washington Post, The New York Times, Slate, The American Prospect, and Time. She was a correspondent for Salon.com in Pakistan after 9/11, and her work appears in numerous other publications, including People, Sports Illustrated for Women, Cosmopolitan, and Women's Health. She has delivered commentary on National Public Radio. She was a visiting scholar at the Center for Investigative Journalism at Brandeis University. She was a Poynter Fellow at Yale University. Nomani is the founder and creator of the \\"Muslim Women's Freedom Tour.\\" She was a lead organizer of the woman-led Muslim prayer in New York City on March 18, 2005, which has been described as \\"the first mixed-gender prayer on record led by a Muslim woman in 1,400 years.\\" Various mixed-gender prayers have been led privately by a Muslim woman, including a 1997 funeral prayer led by a South African Muslim feminist Shamima Shaikh. In 2015 a group of Muslim activists, politicians, and writers issued a Declaration of Reform which, among other things, supports women's rights and states in part, \\"We support equal rights for women, including equal rights to inheritance, witness, work, mobility, personal law, education, and employment. Men and women have equal rights in mosques, boards, leadership and all spheres of society. We reject sexism and misogyny.\\" The Declaration also announced the founding of the Muslim Reform Movement organization to work against the beliefs of Middle Eastern terror groups. In 2015 Nomani and others placed the Declaration on the door of the Islamic Center of Washington. Nomani has argued in favor of government surveillance programs in the fight against Islamic terrorism, saying that society's \\"sense of political correctness has kept us from sensible law-enforcement strategies that look at Muslims, mosques, and Islamic organizations.\\" She argues the Muslim community does not do a good job of policing itself and that public areas were \\"natural meeting spot for criminals.\\" The leader of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, Zuhdi Jasser, agreed with Nomani's argument that such spying tactics were warranted. Nomani has also argued in favor of \\"racial and religious profiling,\\" explaining that the \\"common denominator\\" of many terrorist with anti-American views is they are Muslim. She reiterated that \\"the Muslim community [has] failed to police [them]selves\\" and that such profiling on the basis of \\"religion, race and ethnicity\\" is a necessary \\"part of keeping our skies safe.\\" On November 11, 2016 on CNN, Nomani revealed that she voted for the Republican candidate Donald Trump, and adding that \\"liberals and the left have really betrayed America.\\" After Donald Trump passed controversial Executive Order 13769, Nomani supported the decision and stated that referring to the executive order as a \\"Muslim ban\\" was a \\"propaganda campaign\\" to incite fear in the public. Influence In November 2003, Nomani became the first woman in her mosque in West Virginia to insist on the right to pray in the male-only main hall. Her effort brought front-page attention in a New York Times article entitled Muslim Women Seeking a Place in the Mosque. Inspired by Michael Muhammad Knight's punk novel The Taqwacores,Blue-Eyed Devil, p. 206: \\"At a lecture in Arizona, Mohja Kahf called me the \\"enfant terrible of American Muslim writers.\\" Asra Nomani told me \\"this is how you can finance your life,\\" and said that The Taqwacores had led her to consider that women could lead men in prayer. Referring to the scene in which Tabeya, my niqabi riot grrl, gives a khutbah and serves as imam, Asra promised, \\"we're going to make that a reality.\\" she organized the first public woman-led prayer of a mixed-gender congregation in the United States, with Amina Wadud leading the prayer. On that day, March 18, 2005, she stated: > We are standing up for our rights as women in Islam. We will no longer > accept the back door or the shadows, at the end of the day, we'll be leaders > in the Muslim world. We are ushering Islam into the 21st century, reclaiming > the voice that the Prophet gave us 1400 years ago. In his book Blue-Eyed Devil (p. 209), Knight recalls the event as follows: > Inside the chapel there might have been as many reporters and camera crews > as there were praying Muslims. The imam of the day, Amina Wadud, was so > distracted by the long rows of popping flash-bulbs that in the middle of the > prayer she forgot her ayats. At PMU[Progressive Muslim Union]'s first board > meeting, Ahmed Nassef would read to us an email from Dr. Wadud that > completely washed her hands of the event. Though she still believed in > woman-led prayer, she wanted nothing to do with PMU or Asra Nomani... Wadud > had drawn a clear line between the Truth and the media whores, and we knew > that PMU was on the wrong side. To avoid public criticism, PMU's website > made no mention of Asra's role in organizing the prayer. Asra complained of > PMU shutting her out.Blue-Eyed Devil: A Road Odyssey Through Islamic America In addition to her books, Nomani has expressed her experiences and ideas for reform in op-eds in The New York Times and in several other publications and broadcasts. She was a friend and colleague of The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, who was staying with her in Karachi with his wife Mariane Pearl when he was abducted and later murdered by Islamic militants in January 2002. Nomani is portrayed by British actress Archie Panjabi in the film adaptation of Mariane Pearl's book A Mighty Heart. The Washington Post published a review, by Nomani, of the film in which Nomani argued: \\"...that Danny himself had been cut from his own story.\\" Nomani is interviewed in a 2005 National Film Board of Canada documentary by Zarqa Nawaz about the efforts of North American Muslim women to be accepted in mosques, entitled Me and the Mosque. Impact and reception Regarding the Morgantown mosque issue, Pakistani- American lawyer Asma Gull Hasan, author of Why I Am a Muslim: An American Odyssey, expressed admiration for Nomani, while West Virginia University professor Gamal Fahmy, who claimed that many Muslims believe women should be ‚Äúisolated as much as possible‚Äù to reduce sexual temptation, criticized her and questioned her motives. Others suggest Nomani's woman-led prayer in 2005 led to open discussion and debate about the role of women in Muslim society. Representatives of some Islamic organizations have criticized Nomani on the Morgantown mosque issue, in part because she has openly criticized commonly accepted practices in the American-Muslim community, but also for not sufficiently interacting with longstanding Muslim communities.

However, it is not the only name used for spurs off Highway 1 - Highway 1X is another such designation. Despite these highways being suffixed routes of Highway 1, they are not part of the Trans-Canada Highway network, and are signed with Alberta's provincial primary highway shields instead of the Trans-Canada shields used for Highway 1.  Bow Valley Parkway  The Lake Louise to Banff section of the Banff National Park 1A route is also known as the Bow Valley Parkway.Lake Louise Road & Trail Map It begins at Highway 1 at Lake Louise, generally paralleling it until it meets Highway 1 again approximately west of Banff. It provides more immediate access to attractions in Banff National Park such as Castle Mountain and Johnston Canyon. This spur has a reduced speed limit of , and provides opportunities to view wildlife at various times of the year. Parks Canada introduced planned and marked pullovers along the route to enhance and educate visitors about the region. The Bow Valley Parkway is one of only two parkways between Lake Louise and Banff, and the only one that allows views of the mountain scenery, waterfalls, and various view points of the nearby rivers and creeks. It was the original highway that connected the valley and is advertised as a \\"year-round scenic heritage experience\\". Parks Canada enacted seasonal travel restrictions along the Bow Valley Parkway on a segment between the Johnston Canyon Campground and the Fireside Picnic Area (adjacent to the Highway 1 eastern junction). From March 1 to June 25, travel is not permitted between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. in order to protect wildlife. Highway 1 can be used as an alternate route. = Major intersections = Starting from the west end of Highway 1A:  Bow Valley Trail  The second of the 1A routes, known as the Bow Valley Trail, begins in Canmore, off of the Trans-Canada Highway at exit 91. It formerly began at the Trans-Canada Highway at exit 86 and passed through Canmore; however, ownership of the section was transferred to the Town of Canmore. The roadway still carries the name \\"Bow Valley Trail\\". From exit 91, it heads eastbound, along the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks, until it reaches the Hamlet of Exshaw. From Exshaw, Bow Valley Trail heads to the northeast, past Highway 1X. Just east of Highway 1X, Bow Valley Trail narrows and the speed limit is reduced to for approximately thirty kilometres as it passes through the Stoney Indian Reserve, where warning signs that there may be livestock and/or pedestrians on the road are posted. Highway 1A passes Morley approximately eight kilometres from the reserve's eastern boundary; the community is situated just south of the highway. As the Highway leaves the reserve, it widens and the speed limit increases back to . Shortly after leaving the reserve, the highway skirts the north shore of Ghost Lake, a manmade glacier lake that is a popular spot for Calgary's boating and sailing enthusiasts in the summer, as well as ice sailing in the winter. The lake also supplies most of the water power for Calgary through TransAlta Utilities. Highway 1A meets northbound Highway 40 approximately after passing Ghost Lake. Looking east along the Bow Valley Trail crossing the Grand Valley Creek about 8 km west of Cochrane From Highway 40, Bow Valley Trail proceeds towards the east, and then slightly to the southeast, before reaching the Town of Cochrane, where it intersects with Highway 22\\\\. There, the highway widens to 4 lanes as it leaves Cochrane and proceeds southeast until it reaches Calgary, meeting northbound Highway 766 about west of the city limits. Upon reaching the Calgary city limits at 12 Mile Coulee Road, it continues as Crowchild Trail, a major north-south expressway, (although it travels in a southeasterly direction from the city limits to 24 Avenue NW) through the northwest and southwest parts of the city. Within Calgary, it crosses Stoney Trail (Highway 201) as well as a number of major streets, before reuniting with the Trans- Canada Highway (known as 16 Avenue N) near McMahon Stadium and the University of Calgary. The section along Crowchild Trail is maintained by the City of Calgary rather than Alberta Transportation. Before 1972, this route was the only road to Banff National Park. = Major intersections = Starting from the west end of Highway 1A:  Former alignments  Icefields Parkway = When initially constructed, the Icefields Parkway was designated as Highway 1A between Lake Louise and Jasper. The route was renumbered to Highway 93 in 1959. = Kicking Horse Pass = A former section of Highway 1A exists along the former Kicking Horse Trail, the original road between Lake Louise and Golden, British Columbia that opened in 1926. When the Trans-Canada Highway was realigned in 1962, the segment became Highway 1A. It began at British Columbia Highway 1, west of the Alberta border in Yoho National Park. It meandered eastward through Kicking Horse Pass to Lake Louise, generally paralleling the main Highway 1 and CPR rail line to the south. The section between Lake Louise (townsite) and Lake Louise (lake) is known as Lake Louise Drive, while the remainder of route is now closed to vehicle traffic and is part the Great Divide hiking trail. = 17 Avenue SE = Highway 1A used to be an alternate route that followed 17 Avenue SE in Calgary and linked with Highway 1 in Chestermere. It began at Highway 2 (Deerfoot Trail) and Blackfoot Trail interchange and continued east along 17 Avenue SE where it passed through the former town of Forest Lawn. It crossed 116 Street SE, entering Chestermere and terminated at the Highway 1 interchange. It was dropped by the province in 2013 and the section within Chestermere was renamed to Chestermere Boulevard. As of 2016, remnant Highway 1A signage still remains on Deerfoot Trail and sections of 17 Avenue SE within Calgary; however, it has been removed along Stoney Trail, through Chestermere, and along the Trans-Canada Highway. = Downtown Calgary = The existing Bow Valley Trail / Crowchild Trail section and former 17 Avenue SE section of Highway 1A used to be connected by following a series of streets through inner-city Calgary. From its present terminus, Highway 1A followed 16 Avenue NW east and was cosigned with Highway 1 to 14 Street NW. Highway 1A turned south, and after crossing the Bow River using the Mewata Bridge, and then branches east at its interchange Bow Trail. Highway 1A passed through downtown Calgary on a pair of one-way streets, with eastbound traffic following 9 Avenue S and westbound traffic following 6 Avenue S. East of 6 Street SE, both directions of Highway 1A followed 9 Avenue SE, crossing the Elbow River on the Inglewood Bridge and passing through the community of Inglewood, linking with eastern section of Highway 1A by either using 16 Street SE and Blackfoot Trail, or directly along 17 Avenue SE.Province of Alberta Canada Official Road Map 1962 (Map). Government of the Province of Alberta. ¬ß Calgary inset. This section of Highway 1A was dropped in the 1970s. = Brooks ‚Äì Medicine Hat = A former alignment of the Trans-Canada Highway between Brooks and Medicine Hat, through County of Newell and Cypress County, is locally referred to as Highway 1A. Running parallel to Highway 1, it runs to the south along the Canadian Pacific Railway mainline. The road is paved between Brooks and Highway 875, with long- term plans to pave it to Tilley, as well as some sections around Suffield. Between Tilley and Suffield, the road has both gravel and unimproved sections and serves as a local ranch-access road. Once in Cypress County, it is referred to as the Old Trans-Canada Highway, while in Redcliff and Medicine Hat, it goes by South Railway Avenue and Saamis Drive. Despite the Highway 1A name, the route is maintained by the local municipalities and is not part of the provincial highway system.  Highway 1X  Alberta Provincial Highway No. 1X is a spur highway between Highway 1 and Highway 1A approximately east of Exshaw near the western edge of the Stoney Indian Reserve. It serves as the only Bow River crossing between Canmore to the west and Morley to the east, providing access to First Nations lands and communities in the area. At in length, it is one of Alberta's shortest provincial highways. = Future = Highway 1X is the designation of two proposed bypasses around Strathmore and Medicine Hat. The Strathmore bypass, temporarily designated as Highway 1X:12, would bypass the town of Strathmore to the south, bypassing approximately of existing Highway 1. The project would also feature a realignment of Highway 24 to follow Highway 817 between Carseland and Strathmore. The Medicine Hat bypass, temporarily designated as Highway 1X:20, would bypass the City of Medicine Hat to the south and west, as well as the Town of Redcliff and the Hamlet of Dunmore; bypassing approximately of existing Highway 1. Both bypasses are currently unfunded with no timeline for construction. Once the bypasses are completed, they would be signed as part of Highway 1\\\\. = Major intersections = References  001A Category:Roads in Calgary Category:Former segments of the Trans-Canada Highway ","title":"Alberta Highway 1A"},{"id":"2464143","text":"Roberto A.

Although the album was not a major commercial success ‚Äî peaking at #80 on the Billboard 200 albums chart ‚Äî and didn't produce a hit, it sold respectably, mostly through steady airplay on college stations. It also gave them the chance to perform as an opening act for Cyndi Lauper and Huey Lewis and the News, and brought the group to the attention of Prince, who would write \\"Manic Monday\\", their first hit. Two singles were released from this album: \\"Hero Takes a Fall\\", which peaked outside the UK Top 40, and \\"Going Down to Liverpool\\", written by Kimberley Rew of Katrina and the Waves,Going Down to Liverpool Songfacts which won the Bangles the BPI Award, the British equivalent of the Grammy.

The novel was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and awarded the PEN/Hemingway Award for best first novel. In 2003, the Guardian Unlimited named Housekeeping one of the 100 greatest novels of all time, describing the book as \\"Haunting, poetic story, drowned in water and light, about three generations of women.\\" Time magazine also included the novel in its TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005. Plot Ruthie narrates the story of how she and her younger sister Lucille are raised by a succession of relatives in the fictional town of Fingerbone, Idaho (some details are similar to Robinson's hometown, Sandpoint, Idaho). Eventually their aunt Sylvie (who has been living as a ) comes to take care of them. At first the three are a close knit group, but as Lucille grows up she comes to dislike their eccentric lifestyle and moves out. When Ruthie's well-being is questioned by the courts, Sylvie returns to life on the road and takes Ruthie with her. The novel treats the subject of housekeeping, not only in the domestic sense of cleaning, but in the larger sense of keeping a spiritual home for one's self and family in the face of loss, for the girls experience a series of abandonments as they come of age. The events take place in an uncertain time, in that no dates are mentioned; however, Ruthie refers to her grandfather living in a sod dugout in the Midwest, before his journey to Fingerbone, while she herself traverses adolescence sometime in the latter half of the 20th century, as Ruthie reads the novel Not as a Stranger, a bestseller from 1954.

He was knighted in 1994.Martin Wainwright Obituary: Irvine Patnick, The Guardian, 31 December 2012 Early life The second of four sons born to Aaron Michael Patnick and Bessie (n√©e Levin) Patnick in Sheffield, he was educated in Sheffield at the Central Technical School followed by Sheffield Polytechnic. A building contractor, Patnick entered politics as a member of Sheffield City Council in 1967 and later of South Yorkshire County Council. Parliamentary career After unsuccessfully contesting Sheffield Hillsborough at the 1970 and 1979 general elections, he was elected as Member of Parliament for Sheffield Hallam in 1987. During his time as an MP he was a Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty's Treasury and deputy Chairman of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Select committee. He left politics after he lost his seat in the 1997 general election to the Liberal Democrat Richard Allan. Patnick was on the right wing of the Conservative Party. He was against sanctions on the apartheid regime in South Africa, voted to reintroduce the death penalty, strongly supported the anti- homosexual Section 28 of the Local Government Act and, in a similar vein, opposed reducing the age of consent for homosexuals. He coined the phrase 'People's Republic of South Yorkshire' in reference to the policies of the Sheffield City Council under the direction of David Blunkett. He was the vice- president of Sheffield's Kingfield Synagogue, life president of Sheffield Jewish Representative Council, and a former national vice-chairman of the British Maccabi sports and youth organisation. Patnick was also the chairman of trustees of The Trust for Research into Freemasonry, a charity established to support the Centre for Research into Freemasonry and Fraternalism at the University of Sheffield. =Hillsborough= Patnick was one of the sources for The Sun newspaper's inaccurate coverage of the Hillsborough disaster in April 1989. In September 2012, the publication of the report by the independent panel investigating the disaster confirmed that \\"the source for these despicable untruths was a Sheffield news agency reporting conversations with South Yorkshire Police and Irvine Patnick, the then MP for Sheffield Hallam\\". Earlier, Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie had said of his coverage: \\"It was a fundamental mistake. The mistake was I believed what an MP said\\". The Daily Express also carried the story, under the headline \\"Police Accuse Drunken Fans\\" and giving Patnick's views, saying he had told Margaret Thatcher, who was being escorted by him on a tour of the grounds after the tragedy, of the \\"mayhem caused by drunks\\" and that policemen had told him that they were \\"hampered, harassed, punched and kicked\\". After the disclosure of Patnick's role in creating what Prime Minister David Cameron called an \\"unjust and untrue narrative that sought to blame the fans\\", Labour MP John Mann wrote to Cameron asking that Patnick be stripped of his knighthood for his \\"shameful and disgusting behaviour\\". Patnick was also heavily criticised by the families of the dead, with the Hillsborough Justice Campaign stating that \\"It needs to be remembered that this man vilified Liverpool and was part of a lying machine which shamefully damaged the reputation of those fans.\\" In a statement issued through the Conservative Party on 13 September 2012, Patnick accepted \\"responsibility for passing such information on without asking further questions. So, many years after this tragic event, I am deeply and sincerely sorry for the part I played in adding to the pain and suffering of the victims' families\\". Death Patnick died on 30 December 2012 in Sheffield with his funeral taking place the following day.

Suleiman stars in the film along with his family members, his relatives, and other non-actors.Baumgarten, Marjorie. \\"Chronicle of a Disappearance\\". Austin Chronicle. Published 1997. Retrieved August 22, 2009. Dhat Productions produced the film. The film features no real storyline or character arc. Suleiman plays himself returning to Israel and the West Bank after a long absence which is followed by a series of barely connected vignettes and sketches, which are intended to convey the feelings of restlessness and uncertainty from Palestinian statelessness. The film's tone varies through these scenes such as \\"Nazareth Personal Diary\\", which has a light and domestic tone, and \\"Jerusalem Political Diary\\", which has a more ideological tone. Chronicle of a Disappearance was Suleiman's first feature film. It has received international critical acclaim and was shown at the 1996 Venice Film Festival, where it won the award for Best First Film Prize.  Plot  The film is set in the tense period in the Israel- Palestinian peace process shortly after the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin and the election of Benjamin Netanyahu, with the strained relations implied but not explicitly depicted. It is divided into two major sections, all loosely tied together as the story of Suleiman's return to the West Bank and Israel.Schwartz, Dennis. \\"Chronicle of a Disappearance\\". Ozus' World Movie Reviews. Published June 1, 1999. Retrieved August 22, 2009. The character of Suleiman in the film is described only as 'E.S.' E.S. returns from a twelve- year exile in New York City and is now in unfamiliar territory. Within the film, no real plot or character development emerges. A series of mostly unconnected scenes take place one after the other in documentary film like fashion. The gradual accumulation of images and dialogue start without conclusion presenting an unsettling kind of feeling, which was meant to convey the quality of life led by Palestinians given their statelessness. The first, and lightest, section is the \\"Nazareth Personal Diary\\", featuring warm observations of his family and his relatives' lives. Some of the notable vignettes include the dull yet comedic routines of the proprietor of a souvenir shop called \\"the Holyland\\" in which he fills bottles of alleged holy water from his own tap and fails to keep a cheap camel statuette from falling over on his shelves. E.S. and the shop owner spend time sitting in front of the stop waiting futilely for tourists to stop by. A boat full of Arab men fish, as one of the men bashes various Palestinian families that his friend does not belong to while praising the one that his friend does belong to. Suleiman also interviews a Russian Orthodox cleric who rails against the tourists polluting the Sea of Galilee. A short middle segment shows E.S. getting up to speak at a conference on Palestinian film making; the microphone immediately begins feeding back and he leaves the podium. The last section, \\"Jerusalem Political Diary, has a quicker narrative pace and a more overtly ideological message. Absurd humor is evoked alongside feelings of anti-Israeli paranoia in the characters; for example, what first appears to be a terrorist's hand grenade held by a Palestinian turns out to be a cigarette lighter. Suleiman discovers an Israeli policeman's walkie-talkie, and he then meets up with a single young Arab woman who is engaging in a search for an apartment that is just as fruitless as the two men's search for tourists. The woman, who speaks fluent Hebrew, is told by Jewish landlords that they do not rent to Arabs, while an Arab landlord tells her to live at home in accordance to Islamic tradition. She uses the walkie-talkie to play various pranks on the Israeli police, at one point singing an overly malevolent version of Israel's national anthem over the air. In the last part of the film, the woman stages a piece in which the police unwittingly participate as a member of a guerrilla theatre group.Brody, Richard. \\"Chronicle of a Disappearance\\".

He left school at sixteen both out of his opposition to the \\"structured and confined\\" nature of his education as well as his difficult socio-economic conditions, and he immigrated to New York to live there for several years. He became seriously interested in filmmaking almost by accident, being asked to translate some parts of a film by the Lebanese-Canadian filmmaker Jay Salloum.

She commented, \\"Much of Palestinian film deals with the liminality of loss and disappearance- of country, of the people, and of the self. In other Palestinian film, however, are these processes of love disappearance more beautifully captured than in Chronicle of a Disappearance.\\" Richard Brody of The New Yorker labeled it \\"witty\\" and lauded its \\"graceful artistry and rhetoric\\". He also stated that Suleiman \\"constructs his film disingenuously around the politics that he omits\\". All Movie Guide commented that \\"[i]n his fragmented, personal, self- critical, and low-key way, Suleiman makes his point that the disappearance he's chronicling is that of the identity of his people.\\" Sam Adams of The Philadelphia City Paper stated that the film \\"succeeds because of aesthetics, not politics' and avoids ideological commentary on the conflict. Critic Dennis Schwartz of Ozus' World Movie Reviews panned the film. In particular, he cited its portrayal of both Nazareth and Jerusalem as part of 'Palestine' despite the sovereign Israeli history in those cites as inappropriate and provocative. He also criticized its disjointed, non-linear structure. Writing in Time Out New York, Andrew Johnston (critic) observed: \\"While Suleiman's debut initially seems to take the Seinfeld concept of being \\"about nothing\\" to new extremes, the ultramundane vignettes that make up Chronicle (voted Best First Feature at the '96 Venice Film Festival) ultimately advance an intriguing thesis, using humor rather than rhetoric to do so.\\" When asked about the international critical praise for the film by IndieWire, Suleiman commented:  See also  * Films about the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict * List of Palestinian films * Artistic minimalism * Notable films in 1996  References  External links  * Category:1996 films Category:1996 drama films Category:Palestinian films Category:Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict films Category:Films directed by Elia Suleiman Category:1996 directorial debut films ","title":"Chronicle of a Disappearance"},{"id":"2464203","text":"KUMU-FM (94.7 MHz) - branded as 94.7 KUMU (pronounced koo-moo) - is a commercial radio station in Honolulu, Hawaii.

He was the third (and youngest surviving) son of Albert, Duke of Saxony, and Sidonie of Podƒõbrady, daughter of George of Podebrady. The Teutonic Knights had been in a long power struggle with Poland over Prussia. Because the Teutonic Knights' fortunes had declined throughout the 15th century, they hoped that by selecting someone connected by marriage to the ruling Jagiellon dynasty of Poland, they would strengthen their position. Born prematurely seven months after his immediate elder sibling in Torgau, Frederick was a member of the Albertine line, the junior branch of the prestigious House of Wettin which ruled Saxony. Frederick should not be confused with his cousin of the same name from the Ernestine line, who ruled the Electorate of Saxony. Frederick's older brother George had married Barbara, a sister of King John I Albert of Poland. The young duke was elected Grand Master in 1498. When the Polish king summoned Frederick to do homage for the Order's holdings, he referred the matter to the Imperial Reichstag set to meet in Worms in 1495. The Reichstag informed John I Albert that he could not interfere in the Grand Master's free exercise of power in Prussia. Frederick's delaying tactics were assisted by the quick succession of three Polish kings during his 12 years in office. Frederick died in Rochlitz. By custom, grand masters of the Order did not marry, so he had neither wife nor descendants.

Development  The battle sequences featuring thousands of extras along with horses, elephants and chariots were filmed in Kolhapur.  Plot  The story is set in 326 B.C. The film begins after Alexander the Great (Sikander in Hindustani) conquers Persia and the Kabul valley and approaches the Indian border at Jhelum. He respects Aristotle and loves Persian Rukhsana (known in the west as Roxana). Sohrab Modi plays the Indian king Puru (Porus to the Greeks). Puru requests neighbouring kingdoms to unite against a common foreign enemy. The story goes that when Sikander defeated Porus and imprisoned him, he asked Porus how would he like to be treated. Porus replied: \\"the same way a king is treated by another king\\". Sikander was impressed by his answer and set him free.

In India, the political atmosphere was tense, following Gandhi's call to civil disobedience. Sikander further aroused patriotic feelings and nationalistic sentiment. Thus, though Sikander was approved by the Bombay censor board, it was later banned from some of the theatres serving British Indian Army cantonments. However, its appeal to nationalism was so great and direct, it remained popular for years. It was revived in Delhi in 1961 during the Indian march into Goa. After the movie was a huge box office success, it was dubbed and released in Persian. The music of Sikandar was composed by Meer Sahib. A prominent song was \\"Zindagi Hai Pyar Se, Pyar Se Bitaye Ja\\".

The game‚Äîthe first televised nationally‚Äîwas seen by millions of viewers across America and heard on radio by millions more, including thousands of American servicemen stationed in Korea, listening on Armed Forces Radio. The classic drama of snatching victory from defeat to secure a pennant was intensified by the epic cross-town rivalry between the Giants and Dodgers and by a remarkable string of victories in the last weeks of the regular season by the Giants, who won 37 of their last 44 games to catch the first-place Dodgers and force a playoff series to decide the NL champion. The Giants' late-season rally and 2-to-1-game playoff victory, capped by Thomson's moment of triumph, are collectively known in baseball lore as \\"The Miracle of Coogan's Bluff\\", a descriptor coined by the legendary sports columnist Red Smith. The phrase \\"shot heard 'round the world\\" is from the poem \\"Concord Hymn\\" (1837) by Ralph Waldo Emerson about the first clash of the American Revolutionary War. It later became popularly associated with Thomson's homer and several other dramatic historical moments.Concord Hymn by Ralph Waldo Emerson. poetryfoundation.org archive. Retrieved November 20, 2014. Background The principal National League (NL) contenders in 1951 were the New York Giants, Brooklyn Dodgers, and Philadelphia Phillies. The Dodgers quickly pulled into first place, and widened their lead as the season progressed. On August 11, with a -game lead over the second-place Giants, they appeared certain to face the New York Yankees in the World Series. \\"Unless [the Dodgers] completely fold in their last 50 games\\", wrote an Associated Press writer, \\"they're in.\\" The Phillies, games back, faded from contention; but the Giants won 16 straight games from August 12 to August 27, cutting the Dodgers' lead to six games. By September 20, they had pulled to within games, still a prohibitive margin with only ten days remaining in the season; but the Giants won all of their final seven games, while the Dodgers lost six of their last ten. The two teams concluded the regular season deadlocked with records. The NL used a three-game playoff at that time to break ties for the pennant. The Dodgers won the coin toss to determine the playoff schedule; they elected to play the first game at home and the second (and third if needed) at the Polo Grounds, reasoning that after a likely win in Brooklyn, they would need to win only one of two at the Giants' park. Nevertheless, in game one at Ebbets Field, the Giants, with Jim Hearn on the mound, defeated the Dodgers' Ralph Branca 3‚Äì1, thanks to home runs by Bobby Thomson and Monte Irvin. In game two at the Polo Grounds, with the Yankees team in attendance as spectators, the Dodgers tied the series, winning 10‚Äì0 on home runs by Jackie Robinson, Gil Hodges, Andy Pafko, and Rube Walker, who was catching in place of an injured Roy Campanella. Clem Labine pitched a six-hit shutout against Sheldon Jones. The 1‚Äì1 deadlock set up the deciding third game at the Polo Grounds on October 3. The game For game three, Sal Maglie was on the mound for New York, while Brooklyn called on Don Newcombe. In the first inning, Robinson singled in Pee Wee Reese for the game's first run. A Giants rally in the second inning, initiated by Whitey Lockman's single, fizzled when Thomson, trying to stretch a single into a double, failed to notice that Lockman had not advanced to third base, and was tagged out by Robinson.Smith, R. \\"Miracle of Coogan's Bluff\\". New York Herald Tribune, October 4, 1951, p.1. The score remained 1‚Äì0 through the sixth inning. In the seventh inning, Irvin led off with a double for the Giants. He was bunted over to third, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Thomson, tying the score at one run each. In the top of the eighth, the Dodgers came back with three runs. With Reese and Duke Snider on third and first after back-to-back singles, a Maglie wild pitch allowed Reese to score and Snider to advance to second. Robinson was walked intentionally to set up a double play, but Pafko's ground ball to third bounced off the heel of Thomson's glove; Snider scored and Robinson took third. Billy Cox added another single to score Robinson, making the score 4‚Äì1 in favor of the Dodgers. Newcombe set down the Giants in order in the bottom of the eighth, while Larry Jansen did the same in relief of Maglie in the top of the ninth. Newcombe had pitched a complete game on September 29, four days earlier, in Philadelphia, followed by 5‚Öî innings in relief the following day during the last game of the regular season. According to some accounts, after eight innings on only two days' rest he attempted to take himself out of the game, but Robinson demanded that he continue: \\"You go out there and pitch until your arm falls off!\\" Newcombe himself insisted that he never asked to be relieved‚Äîa version corroborated by Snider and Pafko.Goldblatt, A. The Giants and the Dodgers: Four Cities, Two Teams, One Rivalry. McFarland (2003), pp. 110‚Äì12. Giants shortstop Alvin Dark singled off Newcombe to start the bottom-ninth rally. At that point, the Dodgers made a crucial defensive mistake: With no outs, a runner on first, and a three-run lead, the normal strategy would be to position the infield for a possible double play; but first baseman Gil Hodges played behind Dark ‚Äî apparently guarding against a highly unlikely steal attempt ‚Äî leaving a large gap on the right side of the infield. Don Mueller, batting left-handed, hit a single through that gap, advancing Dark from first to third. Instead of a rally-killing double play, the Dodgers found themselves facing the potential tying run at the plate with two runners on base, nobody out, and Irvin, with 121 regular-season RBIs, at bat; but Newcombe got Irvin to chase an outside pitch and foul out to Hodges. (Sportswriter Bud Greenspan and others have argued that, had the Dodger infield played Mueller at double- play depth, Irvin's pop-up would in all likelihood have been the season-ending third out.Greenspan, B. Play It Again, Bud! New York, Ballantine Books (1974), pp. 78‚Äì83. ) Lockman followed with a double down the left field line, driving in Dark and advancing Mueller to third. Mueller slid awkwardly into the base, injuring his ankle, and was replaced by pinch runner Clint Hartung. With Thomson coming up, Dodgers manager Chuck Dressen finally pulled the exhausted Newcombe. In the bullpen, where Branca and Carl Erskine were warming up, coach Clyde Sukeforth noticed that Erskine ‚Äî who had been troubled by arm problems all season ‚Äî was bouncing his curve balls short of the plate, and advised Dressen to use Branca in relief. That decision has been continually second- guessed by fans, sportswriters, and baseball historians: Branca had lost six of his last seven decisions, and gave up a game-winning home run to Thomson in the first playoff game. Dressen's options, however, were severely limited: the only other available pitchers with crucial-situation experience were Clyde King, who was sidelined with biceps tendonitis; Preacher Roe, who was left- handed; and Labine, who had pitched a complete game the day before. Nevertheless, it was the second questionable decision by Dressen that inning.Goldblatt (2003), p. 114. Thomson was now at bat, with first base open and Willie Mays (soon to be named the NL Rookie of the Year) on deck. Mays had gone 0-for-3 with two strikeouts against Branca in the first playoff game; but Dressen was unwilling to put the winning run on base, and worried that a veteran pinch hitter might be brought in to bat for Mays if he did so. In a third controversial decision, Dressen elected to pitch to Thomson rather than walk him intentionally.Goldblatt (2003), p. 115. Thomson later recalled that as he left the on-deck circle, Giants manager Leo Durocher turned to him and said, \\"If you ever hit one, hit it now.\\"Regan, B. (August 9, 2007). No. 756 takes Giants back to 1951. MLB.com archive. Retrieved November 20, 2014. Branca's first pitch was a called strike on the inside corner. His second was a fastball high and inside, intended as a setup for his next, a breaking ball down and away; but Thomson connected strongly, driving the ball down the left field line. The ball landed in the lower-deck stands near the left field foul line for a game-ending, three-run home run. Thomson ran the bases, then disappeared into a mob of jubilant teammates gathered at home plate. The stunned Dodger players began the long walk toward the visitors' clubhouse under the center field bleachers; Robinson turned to watch Thomson, making certain that he touched every base, before following his teammates off the field.Fimrite, R. Side By Side. Sports Illustrated, September 16, 1991. Later, after the celebrations had calmed down, a delegation of Dodgers‚ÄîReese, Snider, Roe, and Robinson‚Äîvisited the Giants' locker room to offer their congratulations. \\"I just want you to know that we didn't lose the pennant,\\" Robinson told them. \\"You guys won it.\\" Thomson's role in the game Prior to hitting the game-winning home run, Bobby Thomson was involved in several crucial plays throughout the game, which, interestingly, covered all three facets of the game for a fielder (Thomson played third base) ‚Äî hitting, fielding, and baserunning. He had an excellent day at the plate, going 3-for-3, and batting in four of the Giants‚Äô five runs. In fact, he erased both Dodger leads in the game: Not only did he cap the Giants‚Äô ninth-inning rally to change the outcome of the game, but he had also tied the game at 1‚Äì1 with a sacrifice fly in the seventh. Besides these heroics at the plate, however, Thomson was also at the center of attention for being involved in plays that had a less fortunate outcome for the Giants. As a matter of fact, Red Smith structured his game recap in the New York Herald Tribune around Thomson's rather ambiguous role in the game.Smith, Red. ‚ÄúMiracle of Coogan‚Äôs Bluff‚Äù New York Herald Tribune, October 4, 1951. Retrieved May 23, 2020. In the second inning with a runner on first, Thomson tried to stretch a single into a double, but didn't realize that his teammate had not advanced to third base. This led to two Giants baserunners being stuck at second and ended a first potential rally for the Giants, who were trailing 1‚Äì0. Since there would not be any scoring over the course of the following four-and-a-half innings (in fact, only one baserunner ‚Äî Thomson of all players ‚Äî would reach as far as second base during that stretch), it seemed more likely that Thomson would enter the history books as one of the scapegoats of endeavors that fell short of winning the pennant. Gordon McLendon, who was broadcasting the game coast- to-coast on the Liberty Radio Network drew comparisons between Thomson's baserunning mistake and the infamous Merkle Boner, which cost the Giants the pennant in 1908.Liberty Broadcasting System, radio broadcast, October 3, 1951: ‚ÄúWe may have had a famous repetition of the incident here today.‚Äù Moreover, Red Smith used that play involving Thomson as part of his story arch on the game and made it the first play of the game he would write about in detail.Smith, Red. ‚ÄúMiracle of Coogan‚Äôs Bluff‚Äù New York Herald Tribune, October 4, 1951.

And again it was Thomson, this time on defense, who would be at the center of attention. After all, two of those Dodger runs scored on balls hit towards him ‚Äî one deflected off his glove into foul territory and the other went by him into left field. The former hit was in fact deemed an error by McLendon on the radio before the official scorer's decision of a hit was announced.Liberty Broadcasting System, radio broadcast, October 3, 1951 The irony of soon-to-be hero Thomson being partially to blame for this Dodgers rally again did not go unnoticed by sportswriter Red Smith, who sarcastically commented on the latter hit by asking ‚Äî and answering ‚Äî the rhetorical question, ‚ÄúWhere does his [the Dodgers‚Äô Billy Cox] hit go?

His call captured the suddenness and exultation of the home run: Broadcasts were not routinely taped in 1951, and no one at any of the local radio or television stations was recording the game. The WMCA call survives only because a Brooklyn-based fan named Lawrence Goldberg asked his mother to tape-record the last half-inning of the radio broadcast while he was at work. In later years, Hodges told interviewers that Goldberg was a Dodgers fan who made the tape \\"so he could hear the voice of the Giants weep when Brooklyn won\\".

According to Tygiel, the \\"two phrases merged in the popular memory\\" and quickly spread to other media, and \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\" soon became the most popular epithet for Thomson's homer. As a result, it is a direct reference to the expression used by Ralph Waldo Emerson in his poem \\"Concord Hymn\\" to describe the opening shot of the Battle of Concord. In addition to containing a historical and literary reference, the phrase can also be seen as a sign of the times. Tygiel reads it as a reflection of \\"American postwar arrogance\\" (suggesting that the whole ‚Äòworld‚Äô was paying attention to American baseball),Neel, Eric. \\"The Shot That Changed The World\\" ESPN Classic, November 19, 2003.

Another front-page piece said 'Bobby Thomson exploded' and 'it was murder in Brooklyn.' In the Herald Tribune, Rud Rennie said Thomson hit a 'sudden, dramatic, breath-taking wallop,' Dan Bloom marveled at the 'sudden death he administered to the Dodgers,' and another piece referred to the home run as a 'mighty blow for freedom.'\\" As a matter of fact, the very same day that Thomson hit his home run, the Soviet Union set off an atomic bomb test, which created the juxtaposition of the \\"'unrepeatable, communal joy' of [‚Ä¶] Thomson's gallop around the bases and the collective fear inspired by an escalating atomic race\\" in the next day's newspapers. That being said, the nickname may have also simply emerged and stuck as a result of the extended media coverage of the game. After all, it was \\"the first baseball [game] ever televised on a truly national basis\\", as coast-to-coast cable had just been installed.

The team overcame a seemingly insurmountable deficit of 13 games in the National League standings on August 11 to even force the three-game playoff series against the Dodgers. \\"1951 New York Giants Schedule\\" Baseball Reference. Retrieved June 6, 2020: After a loss on August 11 the Giants were 13 games behind first place with 44 games remaining on their schedule. Some sources (e.g. Thomas Boswell) claim that the deficit was 13 1/2 games at some point, but that appears to be a technicality since it was never at 13 1/2 after a full day's set of games. Technically speaking, the \\"games behind\\" statistic changes by half a game once a game is over while other games are still in progress, which is why the deficit may in fact have been 13 1/2 games for a few minutes or hours on August 11, when some games had already ended and others were still in progress. Sign stealing In ensuing years, rumors began to circulate that during the second half of the 1951 season, the Giants engaged in systematic sign stealing‚Äîstealing the finger signals transmitted from catcher to pitcher that determine the pitch to be thrown. The Associated Press reported the rumor in 1962, but with no specifics, and based on an anonymous source. In 2001, many of the 21 Giants players still alive at the time, and one surviving coach, told the Wall Street Journal that beginning on July 20, the team used a telescope in the Giants clubhouse behind center field, manned by infielder Hank Schenz and later by coach Herman Franks, to steal the finger signals of opposing catchers. Stolen signs were relayed via a buzzer wire connected from the clubhouse to telephones in the Giants dugout and bullpen‚Äîone buzz for a fastball, two for an off-speed pitch. \\"Every hitter knew what was coming,\\" said pitcher Al Gettel. \\"Made a big difference.\\"Was the '51 Giants Comeback a Miracle, Or Did They Simply Steal the Pennant?

Whether the telescope-and-buzzer system contributed significantly to the Giants' late-season 37‚Äì7 win streak remains a subject of debate.

Thomson's game bat and shoes are the centerpieces of an exhibit dedicated to the Shot at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. The exhibit is one of the Hall's most popular attractions, according to curators. Thomson's game jersey is most likely in the collection of Dan Scheinman, a collector who owns a small minority stake in the Giants. In 2005, he bought two 1951 jerseys‚Äîone home and one road‚Äîfrom Thomson, who told him that he had worn them in the World Series, but could not remember whether he had worn the home jersey for the Shot game. Scheinman has said that he is \\"about 90 percent\\" confident that the home jersey is indeed the one Thomson was wearing when he hit the Shot: The Giants almost certainly wore the same uniforms for the Series‚Äîwhich began the day after the Shot game‚Äîthat they used during the second half of the season (as did the Yankees), and Scheinman's jersey displays distinct puckering around the numbers, probably as a result of steam pressing, that is visible in photos of Thomson taken during and immediately after the Shot game. According to a professional textile conservator, such puckering cannot be mimicked or reproduced, and would not repeat itself in exactly the same pattern on a different jersey. The location of the ball is unknown. Documentary filmmaker and author Brian Biegel attempted unsuccessfully to authenticate a vintage baseball, autographed by several 1951 Giants, that his father had purchased at a thrift store for four dollars, and believed to be Thomson's home run ball.

Since 1985 it has been the location of a series of nightclubs. Nightclubs From 1985 to 1989, nightclub entrepreneur Peter Gatien operated The Limelight nightclub in the building, one of his chain of nightclubs under that name; at some point he bought the building. In January 1989, Gatien sold the building to Fred Hoffman for $3.5 million. Hoffman spent $1 million renovating the building, and in 1989 opened Excalibur and Vision, two \\"sister clubs\\". At the time of their openings in 1989, the two clubs were the largest non-hotel entertainment facility in Chicago.Ziemba, Stanley. \\"Out of the Limelight, Excalibur to Emerge\\" Chicago Tribune (June 5, 1989) p.8 The northern portion of the building was Vision, which had its own entrance. Vision was a large multi- level, multi-room nightclub that catered to fans of hip-hop, trance, and or house music. Notable guests who played at Vision included Rihanna, MSTRKRFT, Moby, Paul van Dyk, Benny Benassi, Cosmic Gate, Armin Van Buuren, Ti√´sto, Gabriel & Dresden and Gareth Emery.

It was adopted in 1985 and replaced the previous vehicles, the BTR-60 and BTR-70, in the Soviet Army. It was first deployed during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. Description The Soviets-based the BTR-80 on the BTR-70 APC. It has a single 260-hp, V-8 turbocharged, water-cooled, diesel engine, an improvement over the twin gasoline engines installed in the BTR-60 and BTR-70 vehicles. The reconfigured rear portion of the hull accommodates the new, single engine. The Soviets removed the roof chamfers of the modified BTR-70, raised the rear, and squared off the rearward-sloping engine compartment. Standard equipment includes TNPO vision blocks, TNP-B and TKN-3 optical devices for the driver and commander, an OU-3GA2M infrared search light, six 81 mm smoke grenade launchers 902V \\"Tucha\\", a radioset (R-173 or R-163-50U), an intercom, and hydrojets for amphibious propulsion. =Capabilities= BTR-80 interior The Soviets modified the truncated cone turret used on the BTR-70 for the BTR-80 by redesigning the mantlet. This allows the KPVT and coaxial PKT machine guns to be elevated to a maximum of 60 degrees. This high angle of fire is useful in engaging targets on steep slopes, in urban fighting, and for engaging low slow flying air targets.Zaloga 1990: \\"The turret on the BTR-80 uses a new trunnion mounting which gives greater elevation for firing at enemy helicopters.\\" The Soviets had also modified the design and positioning of the firing ports; the ports are now round, rather than tear-shaped, and have ball mounts similar to those used on the BMP-1. The forward firing ports now sit in angled recesses, which allows infantry to fire to the front of the vehicle. The redesigned side doors are split horizontally. The upper portion opens forward; this gives dismounting troops some protection against small arms fire from the front of the vehicle. The lower portion opens down, forming a step. Six smoke grenade projectors are mounted on the rear of the turret. The BTR-80 can climb a slope with up to 60% gradient and climb a vertical step of 0.5 m. =Remarks= A Russian BTR-80 in water. In 1984, the Soviets began production of a diesel-engined variant of the BTR-70, which they called the BTR-80. The Soviets have retrofitted some BTR-70s with several of the improvements incorporated into the BTR-80, including the high-angle-of-fire turret. The twin doors are designed to allow the infantry to disembark while the vehicle is in motion, and allow the infantry inside to exit from one side if the other is receiving fire. The 30mm Cannon variants are effective against most targets apart from main battle tanks, against which they can still cause significant damage to optics, weapons, and important systems. The main gun is not stabilized, so accurate fire on the move is limited to low speeds, and the turret's rotation mechanism is manually operated. The gunner sits in a roof- mounted chair located above the flat floor behind the driver/commander and two passengers, and before the passenger bench. The gunner's station is basic, but uncharacteristically spacious for a Soviet armored vehicle. The gunner is equipped with both a day time optical sight and an infrared night sight.

In 1993, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.National Women's Hall of Fame, Emily Blackwell Biography Blackwell was born on October 8, 1826 in Bristol, England. In 1832 the family emigrated to the US, and in 1837 settled near Cincinnati, Ohio. Inspired by the example of her older sister, Elizabeth, she applied to study medicine in Geneva, New York, where her sister graduated from in 1849 but was rejected. She was then accepted to Rush Medical College for a year but the state medical society censured the college and she was only able to attend one semester. Eventually, she was accepted to the Medical College of Cleveland, Ohio, Medical Branch of Western Reserve University, earning her degree in 1854. In 1857 the Blackwell sisters and Marie Zakrzewska established the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children. From the beginning, Emily took responsibility for management of the infirmary and in large part for the raising of funds. For the next forty years, she managed the infirmary, overseeing surgery, nursing, and bookkeeping. Blackwell traveled to Albany to convince the legislature to provide the hospital with funds that would ensure long-term financial stability. She transformed an institution housed in a rented, sixteen-room house into a fully-fledged hospital. By 1874 the infirmary served over 7,000 patients annually. During the American Civil War, Blackwell helped organize the Women's Central Association of Relief, which selected and trained nurses for service in the war. Emily and Elizabeth Blackwell and Mary Livermore also played an important role in the development of the United States Sanitary Commission. Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, ca. 1860s After the war, in 1868 the Blackwell sisters established the Women's Medical College in New York City. Emily became professor of obstetrics and, in 1869, when Elizabeth moved to London to help form the London School of Medicine for Women, became dean of the college. In 1876 it became a three-year institution, and in 1893 it became a four-year college, ahead of much of the profession. By 1899 the college had trained 364 women doctors. Blackwell and Cushier's house in Montclair, NJ From 1883, Blackwell lived with her partner Elizabeth Cushier, who also served as a doctor at the infirmary. Blackwell and Cushier retired at the turn of the century. After traveling abroad for a year and a half, they spent the next winters at their home in Montclair, New Jersey and summers in Maine.Faderman (2000), p. 289 Blackwell died on September 7, 1910 in York Cliffs, Maine, a few months after her sister Elizabeth's death in England. Legacy Blackwell was denied admission to study medicine at the Geneva Medical College in Geneva, New York, from which her older sister had graduated. After being rejected by several other schools, she was finally accepted in 1853 by Rush Medical College in Chicago. However, in 1853, when male students complained about having to study with a woman, the Illinois Medical Society vetoed her admission. She was accepted by the Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland, Ohio, and earned her M.D. degree in 1854. She subsequently pursued further studies in Edinburgh under Sir James Young Simpson, in London under Dr. William Jenner, and in Paris, Berlin, and Dresden. The Woman's Medical College of the New York Infirmary. [Announcement, 1868‚Äì69]. At Western Reserve University, the medical education of women began at the urging of reform-minded Dean John Delamater, who was backed by the Ohio Female Medical Education Society, formed in 1852 to provide moral and financial support for the women medical students. Despite their efforts, the Western Reserve faculty voted to put an end to Delamater's policies in 1856, finding it \\"inexpedient\\" to continue admitting women. (The American Medical Association also adopted a report in 1856 advising against coeducation in medicine.) Western Reserve resumed admitting women in 1879, but did so only sporadically for five years. Admission of women at Western Reserve recommenced on a continuous basis in 1918.

The division offers a variety of alternative and special needs programs, and many are offered in multiple locations to improve accessibility for students. As a public system, Edmonton Public Schools accepts all students who meet age and residency requirements. Size Edmonton Public Schools operates 213 schools. There are a total of 125 elementary schools, 39 elementary/junior high schools, 5 elementary/junior/senior high schools, 27 junior high schools, 3 junior/senior highs, 14 senior high schools, and 13 other educational services offered. Approximately 102,000 students attend Edmonton Public Schools and there are over 9,200 full-time staff equivalencies. The proposed operating budget is $1.23 billion for the 2018-2019 fiscal year. Governance A group of nine elected trustees sit on the Board of Trustees for Edmonton Public Schools. Each trustee represents one ward in the city. They are elected every four years, in the regular municipal election. In the election, Edmonton voters can only vote for a trustee to one (not both) of the two main school boards. The last election was held in October 16, 2017. The public and Catholic systems operate independently of each other, and are both under the direct authority of the provincial government of Alberta. History Edmonton's first schoolhouse was built in 1881. The wooden frame building is situated on the same grounds as historic McKay Avenue School. Known now as the 1881 Schoolhouse, it was the first free public school in Alberta. While in use, until 1904, it sometimes served as a courthouse and meeting hall. Also a Provincial Historic Resource, the little school was restored as an Edmonton Public Schools' centennial project in 1982 and moved up from its river valley home of many years to within a few hundred meters of its original location. Edmonton Public Schools Archives and Museum Edmonton Public Schools Archives and Museum is located in historic McKay Avenue School. The building's cornerstone was laid in 1904 by the Governor General of Canada, Lord Minto. The year 1904 marked the beginning of an important new era of growth and prosperity in Alberta, and the building was designed to reflect this importance and inspire awe and grandeur. The design included unique features such as the Ionic Romanesque pillared entranceways. McKay Avenue School served as the site of the first two sessions of the Alberta Legislature (1906 and 1907). It was in the third floor Assembly Hall that the important decision was made to make Edmonton the capital of Alberta. McKay Avenue School was designated a Provincial Historic Resource in 1976. The venerable brick building had played an important role in the educational, social and political development of Edmonton and Alberta, but when in 1983 the enrollment fell to a low of 59 students the school was closed. At that time, in recognition of its importance in the early history of Edmonton and of Alberta, a history- conscious school board made a momentous decision:McKay Avenue School would be preserved to reflect the school district's past and to pass its history on to future generations. Site-Based Decision Making Edmonton Public Schools pioneered the concept of site-based decision making (decentralization) in Canada. Site-based decision making gives principals, who are ultimately responsible for everything that goes on in their schools, the authority, the financial resources and the flexibility to make decisions based on the individual needs of their schools. In 1976, the district initiated a pilot project in seven of its schools and in 1980 had expanded the concept to all of its schools. This initiative has led to Edmonton Public offering an innovative school of choice model in which students have more options as to what school they want to attend to suit their interests, and has led to the creation of many very successful alternative programs such as Vimy Ridge Academy, Old Scona Academic and Victoria School of the Arts. The Edmonton Society for Christian Education and Millwoods Christian School (not part of the former) used to be private schools; however, have both also become part of Edmonton Public Schools as alternative programs. Today, school-based management is functioning successfully in other educational jurisdictions across Canada.Kostek, M.A. (1992). A century and ten: The history of Edmonton Public Schools. Edmonton, AB: Edmonton Public Schools. Schools Edmonton Public Schools' continuum of grades are commonly found in two grade level groupings: kindergarten through grade six being Elementary and grades 7 through 12 being Secondary. Further, Secondary grade groupings can be broken into Junior High (7-9) and Senior High (10-12) schools. However, there are certain schools that include more than one grade level grouping or don't conform to the grouping system. =Elementary Schools= Elementary Schools offer instruction from kindergarten to grade six, unless otherwise noted. *Abbott School *Afton School *Aldergrove School *Athlone School *Bannerman School *Baturyn School *Beacon Heights School *Belgravia School *Belmead School *Belmont School *Belvedere School *Bisset School *Brander Gardens School *Brightview School *Brookside School *Caernarvon School *Calder School *Callingwood School *Centennial School *Clara Tyner School *Constable Daniel Woodall School *Coronation School *Crawford Plains School *Daly Grove School *Delton School *Delwood School *Donnan School *Dovercourt School *Duggan School *Dunluce School *Earl Buxton School *Ekota School *Elmwood School *Evansdale School *Forest Heights School *Fraser School *Garneau School *George H.

Members of its genus (Aconitum) are also known as wolfsbane. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service government lists it as a threatened species. It grows in rare portions of New York State and in portions of the Driftless Area. Northern monkshood is noted for its very distinctive, blue hood-shaped flowers. The flowers are about 1 inch in length, and a single stem may have many flowers. Stems range from about 1 to 4 feet in length. The leaves are broad with coarse, toothed lobes. * Only found in Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio, and New York. * Typically found on shaded to partially shaded cliffs, algific talus slopes, or on cool, streamside sites. These areas have cool soil conditions, cold air drainage, or cold groundwater flowage. On algific talus slopes, these conditions are caused by the outflow of cool air and water from ice contained in underground fissures. These fissures are connected to sinkholes and are a conduit for the air flows. Northern monkshood is a perennial and reproduces from both seed and small tubers. The flowers bloom between June and September and are pollinated when bumblebees pry open the blossom to collect nectar and pollen.  Causes of threatened status  * Habitat loss or degradation - Threats to northern monkshood include contamination and filling of sinkholes, grazing and trampling by livestock, human foot traffic, logging, maintenance of highways and power lines, misapplication of pesticides, quarrying, and road building. * Collection - Some populations have been adversely affected by scientific collection. * This plant is very rare it is currently only found in 4 states.  Protection  * Listing - Northern monkshood was added to the U.S. List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants in 1978. * Recovery plan - The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has developed a recovery plan that describes actions needed to help the plant survive. * Research - Many northern monkshood populations are being monitored to determine long-term population trends. Genetic studies are being conducted so population differences can be better understood. * Habitat protection - A variety of government and private conservation agencies are all working to preserve the northern monkshood and its habitat. Voluntary protection agreements have also been made with some private landowners.

Biography Peter Rowan (right) with Flaco Jim√©nez on stage at Farnham, U.K., 1985 DelFest 2009 Peter Rowan on the Americana Stage at MerleFest in 2017. Rowan was born in Wayland, Massachusetts to a musical family. From an early age, he had an interest in music and learned to play the guitar from his uncle. He formed the rockabilly band the Cupidsin 1956.Goldsmith 2004, p. 263.Von Schmidt, Rooney 1994, p. 64. Influenced by the blues musician Eric Von Schmidt, Rowan traded his electric guitar for an acoustic and began to play the blues. He was also influenced by the folk sound of Joan Baez. In college, he discovered bluegrass after hearing The Country Gentlemen and The Stanley Brothers. He soon discovered the music of Bill Monroe, and with some help from banjo player Bill Keith, he was invited to Nashville to audition for Monroe. Accompanied by Keith, Rowan went to Nashville and was hired in 1963 or 1964 as songwriter, rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist of Monroe's Bluegrass Boys.Goldsmith 2004, p. 263‚Äì264. His recording debut as a \\"bluegrass boy\\" took place on October 14, 1966 and he recorded a total of fourteen songs with Monroe, including the classic \\"Walls of Time\\" co-written with Monroe, before his tenure ended in the spring of 1967.Rosenberg, Wolfe 1991, p. 27‚Äì28. Rowan teamed up with David Grisman in 1967 forming the band Earth Opera which frequently opened for The Doors. In 1969, Rowan joined Seatrain, along with Richard Greene.Goldsmith 2004, p. 264. In 1973, Rowan, together with Greene, Grisman, Bill Keith, and Clarence White, formed the bluegrass band Muleskinner. The band released one album.Goldsmith 2004, p. 265. The same year (1973), Rowan and Grisman formed Old & In the Way with Greene, Jerry Garcia, and John Kahn.Jackson 2000, p. 240. He wrote the song ‚ÄúPanama Red‚Äù that year. Greene was later replaced by Vassar Clements.Jackson 2000, p. 241. Old & In the Way disbanded in 1974; shortly thereafter, Rowan joined The Rowans, a reconstituted version of his brothers' band (The Rowan Brothers, who had recorded and toured since 1970) for three years. For a time, he was touring with Greene in Japan and playing clubs with fiddler Tex Logan. He also formed the Green Grass Gringos. Rowan has been part of Mother Bay State Entertainers and played mandolin on their record of 1963, The String Band Project. He has recorded and performed with his brothers, Lorin and Chris, at various times, starting in 1972. He has composed songs performed by New Riders of the Purple Sage, including \\"Panama Red\\", \\"Midnight Moonlight\\" and \\"Lonesome L.A. Cowboy\\". Rowan also features on In No Sense?

Drummers Larry Attamanuik and Ken Owen and banjo player Jeff Mosier also appear with Rowan's Big Twang Theory when their schedule's permit. \\"I have always wanted a band that was rooted in bluegrass, but could add the twang of Hank Williams, Carl Perkins and Buddy Holly. They all absorbed Bill Monroe's bluegrass into honky-tonk and rockabilly. I grew up dancing to that music.‚Äù ‚Äì Peter Rowan. Peter Rowan's Twang an' Groove Twang an‚Äô Groove is a blend of rhythm and blues, reggae, and bluegrass music.

Biography  His early life is little known; he was probably born in Normandy and may have traveled in Italy. He worked at the church of Saint-Maclou, his earliest documented work,Goujon executed two columns beneath the organs, and bas-reliefs on doors. and the Rouen Cathedral, in 1541-42, where he executed the monument to Louis de Br√©z√©, seigneur d'Anet, before arriving in Paris, where he collaborated with the architect Pierre Lescot at the church of Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois about 1544, working on the pulpit, which was dismantled in the mid-eighteenth century.Goujon's bas-reliefs are conserved at the Mus√©e du Louvre. In 1544-1547 he was occupied with considerable works at the Ch√¢teau d‚ÄôEcouen for the conn√©table de Montmorency. He became \\"sculptor to the king\\" (Henry II of France) in 1547 and in the next years was occupied at the Ch√¢teau of Anet. He was then imprisoned at Ecouen in 1555.The attribution to Goujon of the Maison de Diane de Poitiers (bearing the date 1554) at Ecouen was made by Henri Stein, 1890, based on the document that placed Goujon at Ecouen, imprisoned under orders of the bailli of 27 September 1555 His most famous works are the sculptural decorations made in collaboration with Lescot for the western extension of the Louvre, 1555-62. A fine representative of Mannerism in France, Goujon's figures are elongated, sensual and fluid; his drapery work reveals knowledge of Greek sculpture, though certainly not at first hand. He is also responsible for engravings for Jean Martin's 1547 translation of Vitruvius and for work on the Ch√¢teau of Ecouen, for the Montmorency family. In 1562, Goujon left France for religious reasons (he was a Huguenot). The purity and gracefulness of his style were disseminated throughout France by engravings by artists of the School of Fontainebleau and had an influence in the decorative arts. His reputation was slightly eclipsed at the end of the century by more mannered tendencies, but was appreciated by French Classicism. Goujon was a Protestant; he escaped the French Wars of Religion by exiling himself in Italy in 1562. He probably died in Bologna, where he is last documented in 1563 as a member of a group of Huguenot refugees. Works His most famous works include: * Fountain of the Innocents (1547‚Äì1550) - Goujon sculpted the six nymphs that decorate this public fountain designed by Pierre Lescot. The fountain is currently located - in a much truncated form - in the Les Halles section of Paris; original bas-reliefs are located at the Louvre * Caryatids (1550‚Äì1551) - for the musician's platform in the Louvre, these are highly reminiscent of the Erechtheum in Athens. * Allegories on the facade of the Louvre (1549-155) - these are found in the Cour Carr√©e (or \\"square courtyard\\") of the Louvre * The Four Seasons (illustrations) made for the courtyard fa√ßade of the h√¥tel of Jacques de Ligeris, now housing the Mus√©e Carnavalet, Paris. To Goujon is usually attributed the engravings of the French version of Francesco Colonna's Songe de Poliphile (1546), based on the engravings of the original edition (which may be due to the studio of Mantegna). The famous Fountain of Diana (Diana with a Stag) (c. 1549) Louvre, designed for Diane de Poitiers for the Ch√¢teau d'Anet, was long believed to be by Goujon or his workshop. It is now thought more likely to have been the work of Germain Pilon.Blunt, Anthony; Beresford, Richard (1999). Art and Architecture in France, 1500‚Äì1700, 5th edition, pp. 80‚Äì81.

It was created by Gail Parent and Tracey Jackson and executive produced by Dolly Parton and Sandy Gallin's Sandollar Productions for 20th Century Fox Television.  Overview  The series follows a trio of obese sisters who had other things on their mind besides their weight: like work, relationships, popularity, and starting a family. The ladies also shared a small one-bedroom apartment in New York City, which added to the comic friction. The Gilbert sisters include Darlene (Susan Peretz), the eldest, who was a dog groomer and recently divorced (her husband had an affair with their weight-loss counselor); Charlene (Wendie Jo Sperber), the middle sister, who was a makeup artist for a commercial photographer and was the most active one out of the three; and Marlene (Lesley Boone), the youngest sister, a former toll collector (and later an actress in a pantyhose commercial and a soap opera), who was seen as a dreamer with a naive, yet trusting, personality. Also in the cast was Charlene's boyfriend, Ronnie Underwood (Rick Overton), a restaurant owner. He disappeared at mid-season, as a result putting all three sisters on the dating market. At that time, the girls' landlady, Florence Newman (Nedra Volz), became a regular. All three also had physical elements in their resume and it was evidenced in most of the episodes whenever something would tick off the sisters. Among the notable examples: Charlene getting blown up in a helium dress, Darlene breaking a hockey stick while attending a New York Rangers game that got her on probation and head-butting Ronnie over who was going to spend the night at the apartment, Marlene waking the sisters up with potato chips after they didn't hear her come in, and the sisters ganging up on a mime after he mocked them. Cast * Wendie Jo Sperber as Charlene Gilbert * Susan Peretz as Darlene Gilbert * Lesley Boone as Marlene Gilbert  Controversy and cancellation  The show was initially criticized by several groups for making fun of overweight people due to some of the jokes that were used in the show's early episodes, but the controversy faded as later episodes began to put a more positive spin on the characters when it came to weight issues (this was pointed out in one episode in which they vowed the word \\"fat\\" would not come up in the conversation while they had an argument). The girls had differing views of their body image, with Charlene being most concerned about health issues and frequented a gym, then was ridiculed by an attractive woman. An enraged Charlene later returns to tell off the heckler. Although it had the Top 30 hit The Simpsons as its lead-in, it could not hold on to a large enough percentage from that show, and also at least partially because of the controversy, it did not earn a second season and was cancelled at the end of the 1990-1991 season. EpisodesInternational broadcasts The series also aired in France under the title Jamais Deux Sans Trois (Never Two Without Three). In Israel the show was titled Nashim Gdolot (Big Women).

It is just as strong as kraft paper but has better printing qualities. Manila is buff- coloured and the fibres of the paper are usually visible to the naked eye. Manila is most commonly used for making file folders and envelopes, called Manila folders and Manila envelopes, respectively. Some fashion schools and people in the fashion industry use large rolls of Manila to create finalised clothing patterns. Because the paper is generally inexpensive, it is commonly given to children for making art. Manila paper was originally made out of old Manila hemp ropes which were extensively used on ships, having replaced true hemp. The ropes were made from Manila hemp (also called abac√°) or Musa textilis, which is grown in The Philippines; hence the association with Manila, the capital of that country. Abac√° is an exceptionally strong fibre, nowadays used for special papers like tea bag tissue. It is also very expensive, being several times more expensive than woodpulp, hence the change to that fiber for what is still called Manilla‚Äîusually with two Ls.

Although Ravel wrote in his autobiography that he wrote the sonatina after his piano suite Miroirs, it seems to have been written between 1903 and 1905.Maurice Ravel - Sonatine He most likely referred to the dates he finished both of the works. Composition Ravel wrote the first movement of the Sonatine for a competition sponsored by the Weekly Critical Review magazine after being encouraged by a close friend who was a contributor to that publication. The competition requirement was the composition of the first movement of a piano sonatina no longer than 75 bars,Dowling, Richard. (2003) Sonatine by Maurice Ravel with the prize being 100 francs. In 1941 the publication Music & Letters printed the article When Ravel Composed to Order by Michel Dimitri Calvocoressi. Calvocoressi discussed how he supposedly encouraged Ravel to write the piece in response to a competition posted in the Paris Weekly Critical Review. Peter Jost of G. Henle Publishers found the original article in the Review published in three March 1903 editions. The original manuscript that Ravel submitted had the text ‚Äòpar Verla‚Äô written and struck out, replaced with ‚Äòpar Maurice Ravel‚Äô. Ravel submitted the piece under a pseudonym and chose an anagram of his name. The Sonatine was first performed fully in Lyon on March 10, 1906 by Paule de Lestang. Shortly afterwards the piece received a Paris premiere, where it was played by Gabriel Grovlez. The work was dedicated to Ida and Cipa Godebski; he later dedicated his Ma m√®re l'Oye suite to their children. Structure The piece is in three movements: The leaping fifth melody of the first movement reappears in variations against different textures in the second and third movements.http://scholarlyrepository.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2430&context;=oa_dissertations The first movement is a well-structured, even straightforward, sonata form (albeit utilizing Ravel‚Äôs Impressionistic harmonic colorings). Two themes emerge in the exposition‚Äîthe first in tonic key of F-sharp minor, and the second in D major and B minor. Owing to its diminutive form, the following minuet exists without a trio. Shifting to the key of the dominant (here spelt as D-flat major), it unfolds as a slow waltz, elegant and restrained but nonetheless building through moments of passion and intensity. Lastly, the toccata finale is the most technically challenging of the Sonatine‚Äôs three movements. Inspired in part by the keyboard writing of Couperin and Rameau, the movement shifts restlessly between 3/4 and 5/4 time and abounds in energy, driving the work to a brilliant conclusion. https://www.classicalconnect.com/Piano_Music/Ravel/Sonatine/6261 Keys Both the first and third movements begin in F minor and end in F major. The middle movement is in D major. Reception Reception for Ravel's Sonatine has been mixed but generally favorable. Marcel Marnat wrote that Sonatine captivates us from the very first measure in its depth, adding that in its conciseness and radiance, it is one of Ravel's defining works. In contrast, Arbie Orenstein has written that while Sonatine is pleasant enough, it does not compare to the later Miroirs. Ravel was known to value the work and performed it frequently. Sonatine is easier than some of his other works, such as Gaspard de la nuit, and Ravel (who was anxious about his skills as a pianist) probably performed it because of this. He did not, however, perform the third movement, as it was technically challenging for him.https://www.henle.de/us/detail/?Title=Piano+Sonatina_1018 Arrangement Carlos Salzedo transcribed Sonatine for flute, harp and cello (or viola), titling the transcription Sonatine en Trio.

It was developed by Levitt and Sons in 1963. View of the Levittown Comfort Inn hotel (right) Levittown is divided into eight sections called secciones (the eighth section was renamed Urb. Fronteras) and several sub- divisions called urbanizaciones. Part of what is known as Levittown is located in the municipalities of Cata√±o and Bayam√≥n. Levittown is known for its large, light blue painted water tower (now converted into a public library) that was one of the first water towers in Puerto Rico used to provide potable water to residences. To the west sits Levittown Lakes or Los Lagos de Levittown, a small man-made lake formed by draining the marshland over which Levittown was built. The drainage canal that feeds the lake is called Ca√±o El Hato, which extends into the center of Levittown. To the east, the Bayamon River divides Levittown from the fishing village of Palo Seco, next to the Cata√±o municipality. It has a Blue Flag-rated public beach known as Punta Salinas and also one of the bigger public sports centers of the metropolitan area of San Juan with tennis courts and a stadium for track and field meets. Its Olympic- sized pool has been in use since its construction in 1977. Its high school, Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos High School, was built in 1970 and is named after an important political figure on the island. The school's football team, the Levittown Spartans, have been among the top high school football teams on the island. In 1975 they became the Co-Champions along with the Pirates from Antilles High School, in Fort Buchanan. Also, the Spartans track teams, coached by Wilfredo Meaux (who would later on coach the team from University of Puerto Rico at Bayamon) were perennial powers during the 1970s and 80s. Levittown High's Basketball team has produced several excellent players including Ramon Rivas, who played for the NBA with the Boston Celtics. Pier at Cochino Beach Levittown's main avenue is \\"Bulevar de Levittown\\". It has the largest collection of small business in the entire community. Los Dominicos Avenue is the second main avenue and connects Levittown to other areas, e.g., Sabana Seca sector and the city of Bayam√≥n. Levittown has more than three shopping centers including Plaza Davison and Rio Hondo Mall. Highway 165 connects Levittown with the towns of Toa Baja, Cata√±o and Dorado, Puerto Rico. It is a scenic route that provides a nice coastal view in which Punta Salinas' radar domes and El Morro can be seen. At night, the Morro Castle's lighthouse and the Palo Seco power plant are visible. The coastal area along the road near the Bayamon River is popular with local surfers and is known as Cochino Beach (Pigs Beach), probably because of the brownish waters caused by the sediments flowing out from the river. Punta Salinas, the public beach, is also the home of a Puerto Rico Air National Guard unit, the 140 ADS, that provides air traffic control support to the FAA, military and law enforcement operations. It is also the home of a Civil Air Patrol squadron, one of several in the municipality of Toa Baja. Levittown enjoys tropical weather all year round. The water tower, also known by pilots as the \\"Levittown Water Tank\\" provides a visual navigational checkpoint to aircraft flying either to Isla Grande Airport or to Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport. Transportation It is served by Route D37 of the Puerto Rico Metropolitan Bus Authority and private commuter buses connecting the community with Cata√±o and the Tren Urbano Rapid Transit station in Bayamon. The neighborhood is patrolled by the Toa Baja Municipal Police Department with a precinct in the western part of the neighborhood, and the 271st precinct of the Puerto Rico Police Department located behind the water tank and the high school. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 26,960 people living in the community. The average family size was of 3.09. The population density was 13,279/mi¬≤. There were 11,701 housing units.

In 1999 the game was re-released as shareware by Ambrosia Software and released as open source software and freeware in 2008. The key feature of the game was its ability to zoom in and out smoothly; this allowed the player to switch between a close-up view, which emphasized space combat skills, and a strategic view of the entire map. Story Ishiman vessels defend a newly captured station. The player is cast as the commander of the U.N.S. Apollo, humankind's first interstellar vessel, dispatched at light speed to investigate the source of a signal broadcast at Earth from one hundred and fifty light years away. On reaching the source, the crew is told that, due to relativistic effects, Earth has by now been taken over by the religious Cantharan Order, and the signal was a ruse from the friendly Ishiman, who wished to maintain humanity as a free race; the Ishiman planned to find a new world for the crew of the Apollo. Although the advanced but peaceful Ishiman are unwilling to enter into direct war with the Cantharans, the Apollo's crew is able to persuade them to supply a limited amount of their technology in an attempt to free Earth. Upon undertaking their new mission, the ship is renamed the Ares. Gameplay Ares offers combat situations and strategic planning combined by allowing the player to directly control a single spaceship, at the same time as building and commanding others. Ares is a saga between six main alien species, with humans being one of the less advanced races in the universe: the Audemedons, the Salrilians, the Ishimans, the Cantharan, the Gaitori and the Humans. There are numerous smaller species which come up throughout the solo play levels, such as the Obish, the Elejeetians, and the Bazidanese. These species are not available for online play. The single player game consists of a story plot and 21 levels. When released as a shareware game, Ares came with limited functionality and was limited to the first six levels. In multiplayer, five different game modes are available. Each game has with it a set of absolute strategies to use. Ares had its own page on the Macintosh Gaming League, organized by Ares supporters. Clans were also found around Ares briefly. One of the oldest and highest ranking clan was called \\"TAG\\".  Development  Ares was developed by Nathan Lamont for Classic Mac OS. It also runs natively in OS X Classic environment, available for non- Intel-based Macs. The game was published by Changeling Software and released in 1998. In 1997, during the game's beta testing, Changeling president Jeanine DeSocio expressed apprehension about how well the game would sell, due to retailer reluctance to stock Macintosh-only games.

It is located near the village of Seƒçovlje, south of Portoro≈æ, and less than from the Croatian border. The airport was opened on 27 September 1962. In addition to Portoro≈æ, the airport serves a number of other tourist destinations in the region, including Piran, Izola, Koper in Slovenia, Trieste in Italy and Umag in Croatia. The airport is intended for passenger and cargo transport, sport, tourist and business flights. It lies at two metres above sea level, the runway measures . History Portoro≈æ airport Portoro≈æ Airport from behind As in the case of the development of many airports, Portoro≈æ Airport had a humble beginning. In 1962, ground preparations are initially made for the creation of a sports airport with a grass runway. However, in response to the LZJ decision to allow the third Adriatic Parachute Cup competitions to take place in Portoro≈æ the following year, the plans for the grass runway are ultimately changed and the runway is extended to . On 27 September 1962, a flight inspection team examine Portoro≈æ Airport and recommend the issuance of a six-month temporary registration, which would classify it as a secondary sports airport, permitting the landing of aircraft weighing up to . The following year, on 3 April 1963, Aero club Piran is formed. Later in 1963, the third Adriatic Parachute Cup competitions are held. On 28 January 1971, the city of Piran decides to build an international sports airport at Portoro≈æ Airport. In July of the same year, the airport location is approved and the subsequent construction permits are issued for the construction and reconfiguration of the runway: 700 m long and 20 m wide (2,297 ft. long and 66 ft. wide). On 24 January 1972, the airfield construction and reconfiguration works are completed. The following year, 12 February 1973, the ZUCZP grants permission to register and license Portoro≈æ Airport for aviation sports purposes. Further development of the airport continues, and in January 1975, the Coast Flight Centre is established. Later in 1975, construction work begins on a runway refurbishment and extension project. The first building phase of the airport terminal and platform is also initiated. The following year, on 21 August 1976, the airport re-enters full operations after construction works at the airport are completed. These include an enhancement to the runway, which is extended to and widened to - as well as the construction of an apron. Work is also completed on the first phase of the airport terminal and platform. On 1 October 1978, Portoro≈æ Airport is formally re-opened and entered into the register of airports and the register for panoramic flights. In 1979, a 400 m¬≤ aircraft hangar is constructed and the first C-172 aircraft is purchased. Portoro≈æ Airport gained the status of a commercial passenger airport, when on 2 June 1980, the Federal Authority for Transport and Communications issues a permit that allows the airport to be operated as a category \\"D\\" airport for civilian use in both domestic and international flights. Upgrades to the airport continue, and in the same year, a fueling station, which supplies Avgas 100LL, is built. On 1 May 1981, an Aero Commander 500 (Turbo Commander) aircraft carrying 9 passengers lands from Passau. Also in 1981, the airport facilities are further expanded and include the construction of a control tower, border crossing, meteo and FIO. In 1983, the first Dash 7 lands at the airport. On 24 April 1984, the runway is lengthened to , and widened to . The following year, on 20 July 1984, the airport is registered to handle Dash-7 aircraft. On 20 March 1986, construction work is completed on a technical aircraft hangar and airport fire station. In 1989, in order to facilitate night operations, runway lighting and an approach lighting system in the vicinity of the airport are installed. As a consequence, on 21 March 1989, the Federal Secretary for Transport and Communication issues a permit, which allows night operations. Also, the ICAO classification 2C is established and the fire station receives a category 4 designation. Furthermore, a permit is issued for take-offs and landings of aircraft with a maximum weight of 27 tonnes (54,900 lbs.). Investment in Portoro≈æ Airport continued, and on 15 April 1991, the Casino Touristic Company Turistiƒçno podjetje p.o. Portoro≈æ adopt a memorandum of understanding and form a limited liability company: Aerodrom Portoro≈æ d.o.o. From 13 to 16 May 2004, aviation enthusiasts are welcomed at Portoro≈æ Airport, where the Aviatica general aviation air show takes place. Later that year, on 1 July 2004, Aerodrom Portoro≈æ d.o.o. signs an agreement with its new partners: The Municipality of Piran; Aerodrom Ljubljana, d.d.; Istrabenz, holdin≈°ka dru≈æba, d.d.; and Luka Koper, d.d. (Port of Koper). The recapitalisation plan is intended to facilitate further development of the airport in the near future. The entire airport is scheduled to undergo renovation in the near future. Moreover, there are plans for Portoro≈æ Airport's single runway to be lengthened to and widened to , in order to facilitate the handling of larger aircraft such as the Boeing 757-200. Technical information Although the airport fire station is currently declared CAT 2, it can be upgraded to CAT 4, provided a minimum of 12 hours advance notice is given - prior to commencement of the respective flight operations. Runway 33, which, as in the case of Runway 15, has a runway length of for takeoff purposes. However, unlike runway 15, runway 33 has a displaced threshold, meaning that aircraft landing on this runway, i.e. at a heading of 330¬∞, are required to touchdown (landing) at a position approx. from the beginning of the runway, thereby reducing the runway landing distance to approx. . Airport services Although relatively small, a wide-variety of services are offered at Portoro≈æ Airport: modern airport facilities including technical and fuel service, services under contract (such as air taxi), panoramic flights, business charter flights, a flight school, parachute jumping, minibus transfer, a hotel room booking service, a restaurant, a duty- free shop as well as car rental services.

It is a part of the area covered by the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA). History Batanagar was established to start the first shoe factory in India by Czechoslovak industrialist Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a. The Bata brand was established on 24 August 1894 in Zl√≠n, then in Austria-Hungary (now in Czech Republic). The company first established itself in India in 1931 by renting a building to start an experimental shoe production plant in Konnagar with 75 Czechoslovak experts. Jan Anton√≠n Ba≈•a then built up an industrial manufacturing city called Batanagar in 1934, as well as other factories in Delhi and Patna and elsewhere in India, employing more than 7,000 people. Later Batanagar became one of the bigger suburban cities near Kolkata. GeographyArea overview= Alipore Sadar subdivision is the most urbanized part of the South 24 Parganas district. 59.85% of the population lives in the urban areas and 40.15% lives in the rural areas. In the northern portion of the subdivision (shown in the map alongside) there are 21 census towns.

There is a plant of the Bata company here. The employees mostly reside in Batanagar. Not only the Bata India Shoe factory, another very remarkable feature of Batanagar, is that shoe-making is a predominant cottage industry in Batanagar. Countless houses and families are dedicated to manufacturing shoes of various makes - leather, PVC, jute, etc. for some of the leading shoe brands in India. For example - Khadim's, SreeLeathers, Titas and Liberty which are some of the most renowned shoe makers in India, have outsourced a major portion of their shoe making process to the various entities in Batanagar. Every alternate home in Batanagar houses a small unit which is manufacturing shoes. This feature was born out of necessity, as most of the families residing in Batanagar are dependent on the Bata factory for their livelihood, hence whenever the factory gets locked-out, these families are very severely affected. Hence shoe making from their homes has given them an alternate source of earning. Transport Batanagar is on the Budge Budge Trunk Road.Google maps Nangi railway station is located nearby. Education Techno International Batanagar, established in 2012, offers diploma, undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses in Engineering and Technology and other allied fields.

Design  Mainly, the purpose of the device was to provide a more economical solution for game data storage. The DexDrive was sold at retail for roughly the same price as two Sony- or Nintendo-branded memory cards--$50 MSRP in the U.S. The official cards had a capacity of only 128 KB, far less than even a floppy disk. Cost and capacity were much more favorable on a PC due to the efficiency of hard disk drives. For the cost of two memory cards, DexDrive owners had the opportunity to store effectively limitless amounts of game data by transferring files as needed between the memory cards and the PC. Additionally, as PC files, game data could be shared over the Internet or be used with console emulators.

Hosting over 75,000 students, its student body is comparable to Argentina's third-largest university (the National University of La Plata) and exceeded significantly only by the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) (over 300,000 students). It has 29 semi-independent branches of various sizes located all over the country. The engineering programs taught at most of those locations are: *Aeronautical Engineering *Chemical Engineering *Civil Engineering *Electrical Engineering (program heavily focused on Power Systems Engineering) *Electronic Engineering (program oriented towards electronics and telecommunications engineering) *Industrial Engineering *Information Systems Engineering *Mechanical Engineering It is the only national university in the country with a focus on engineering. Many of the available programs have an intermediate diploma as well, typically after completing up to the 3rd or 4th year (generally Analyst's and Technician's degrees). The university also offers a broad range of degrees at tertiary and postgraduate level, including those of Specialist, Master and Doctorate(PhD) in Engineering. Due to its strongly federalized approach, it is the only university with campuses across the country, graduating almost 50% of the new engineers in Argentina. Research and Development is conducted in 18 official centers. Some of the areas these centers specialize in are: Chemical Engineering, Information Technology, Energy research, Environmental Science, Robotics, Mechanics, and Construction Engineering. Enrollment As it is for most universities in Argentina, the only enrollment requirements are a secondary education degree and passing the university's entrance exam. Because of the low acceptance rate, it is common for applicants to take preparation courses given by either specialized private institutions, or by the university itself. Enrolling into the university's preparation courses given by the univiersity itself does not require a minimum GPA. It only does so if the aspirant desires to take said preparation course before year's end, otherwise applicants are able to enroll in february courses freely, provided they have a valid high school diploma. The students must declare the specialization of engineering they want to study at the moment of enrolling. If they wish to change it after their studies had begun, they have to take lectures in the specialized subjects. Only the foundational subjects are equivalent between degrees. Engineer's Degree After completing a five to six years program (or typically after passing 45 final exams in a longer time period) students earn an Engineer's degree (Eng.), or T√≠tulo de Ingeniero (Ing.) in Spanish. This is a professional degree with legal backing, enabling its graduates to perform any work in their chosen fields. All the programs include the same engineering foundational courses in Calculus, Physics, Algebra, Analytical Geometry, Probability, Statistics, Chemistry, Technical Drawing, Engineering in Society, Economics and Law. Because of the length, breath, rigid structure and declaration of intent when enrolling, the degrees are not equivalent to a Bachelor's degree. But the objectives and professional orientation of the courses are similar to the Master of Engineering and it enables graduates to apply for a PhD in Engineering or related disciplines. Some programs give students the option of getting an Intermediate Engineering Degree (IED) in their chosen fields after finishing the third or fourth year and completing an approved final project. The exact name of the IED varies depending on the field, for example the IED for the Chemical Engineer program is called University Chemical Technician, while the IED for Information Systems Engineer is University Systems Analyst. Curricular Modernization The curriculum has been going through a modernization process focused on analytic programs (\\"adecuaci√≥n curricular\\"), and some careers have passed through a certification process ordered by the government agency CONEAU (Comisi√≥n Nacional de Evaluaci√≥n y Acreditaci√≥n Universitaria). The stated goal of this process is to start adapting the current model in accordance with the Bologna process. History UTN, Buenos Aires, main building. The National Technological University (Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional, UTN) was established as the National Workers' University (Universidad Obrera Nacional) by Law 13229, signed by President Juan Per√≥n on August 19, 1948. It was created to cover the lack of technical specialists in the country at that time. The degree granted was that of Factory Engineer in many specialties. The university evolved rapidly. The necessity of professionals with a deeper knowledge was accomplished by big academic and organizational changes. By 1954 the University had 9 branches in Buenos Aires, C√≥rdoba, Mendoza, Rosario, Santa Fe, Bah√≠a Blanca, La Plata, Tucum√°n and Avellaneda. On October 14, 1959, the university was renamed as the National Technological University by law 14855. This marked the official beginning of the university as it is today. Since then, more than 30,000 degrees in engineering have been granted. Today, the university maintains a strong network of international cooperation, and over 75 overseas institutions have signed cooperation agreements with the UTN.

Greek stamps were introduced in 1914, but there were also overprints of the Samos types until 1915. ;Dates : 1912 ‚Äì 1915 ;Capital : Vathy ;Currency : 100 lepta = 1 drachma ;Main Article Needed : ;See also : Vathy (French Post Office)  San Marino  ;Dates : 1877 ‚Äì ;Capital : San Marino ;Currency : (1877) 100 centesimi = 1 lira : (2002) 100 cent = 1 euro ;Main Article Needed :  Sandjak d'Alexandrette  ;Refer : Hatay  Santander  ;Dates : 1884 ‚Äì 1903 ;Currency : 100 centavos = 1 peso ;Refer : Colombian Territories  Sao Tome e Principe  ;Dates : 1870 ‚Äì ;Capital : Sao Tome ;Currency : (1870) 1000 reis = 1 milreis : (1913) 100 centavos = 1 escudo : (1977) 100 cents = 1 dobra ;Main Article Needed : ;See also : Africa (Portuguese Colonies)  Sarajevo Government (Bosnia)  ;Refer : Bosnia & Herzegovina  Sarawak  ;Dates : 1869 ‚Äì ;Capital : Kuching ;Currency : 100 cents = 1 dollar ;Main Article Needed : ;See also : Malaysia  Sarawak (British Military Administration)  ;Dates : 1945 only ;Currency : 100 cents = 1 dollar ;Refer : BA/BMA Issues  Sarawak (Japanese Occupation)  ;Dates : 1942 ‚Äì 1945 ;Currency :100 cents = 1 dollar ;Refer : Japanese Occupation Issues  Sardinia  Sardinia is a large island in the western Mediterranean, south of Corsica. Before the unification of Italy, the Kingdom of Sardinia was the name applied to a union of Sardinia and Piedmont, although the island was very much the junior partner. Stamps of this state were issued in Turin 1851‚Äì1862 but the country's name is not shown. Gibbons list these stamps under Sardinia, which is strictly correct, but historians generally refer to the state as Piedmont. To prevent confusion between the 19th century state and the present island province, this work has Piedmont as the specific entry and Sardinia as a minor entry. ;Capital : Cagliari ;Refer : Italian States; : Piedmont  Sarkari  ;Refer : Soruth (Saurashtra)  Sarre  ;Refer : Saar  Saseno (Italian Occupation)  ;Dates : 1923 only ;Currency : 100 centesimi = 1 lira ;Refer : Italian Occupation Issues  Saudi Arabia  ;Dates : 1932 ‚Äì ;Capital : Riyadh ;Currency : (1932) 110 guerche = 10 riyal = 1 gold sovereign : (1952) 440 guerche = 40 riyal = 1 gold sovereign : (1960) 100 halalas = 20 guerche = 1 riyal : (1976) 100 halalas = 1 riyal ;Main Article Needed : ;Includes : Hejaz; : Hejaz-Nejd; : Nejd  Saurashtra  ;Refer : Soruth (Saurashtra)  Saxony  ;Dates : 1850 ‚Äì 1868 ;Capital : Dresden ;Currency : 10 pfennige = 1 neugroschen; 30 neugroschen = 1 thaler ;Refer : German States  Saxony (Russian Zone)  ;Dates : 1945 ‚Äì 1946 ;Capital : Halle ;Currency : 100 pfennige = 1 mark ;Refer : Germany (Allied Occupation) ReferencesBibliography * Stanley Gibbons Ltd, Europe and Colonies 1970, Stanley Gibbons Ltd, 1969 * Stanley Gibbons Ltd, various catalogues * Stuart Rossiter & John Flower, The Stamp Atlas, W H Smith, 1989 * XLCR Stamp Finder and Collector's Dictionary, Thomas Cliffe Ltd, c.1960 External links * AskPhil ‚Äì Glossary of Stamp Collecting Terms * Encyclopaedia of Postal History Sa ","title":"Compendium of postage stamp issuers (Sa‚ÄìSb)"},{"id":"2464653","text":"Each \\"article\\" in this category is a collection of entries about several stamp issuers, presented in alphabetical order.

The Qajar Persian empire, who had reasserted century long Iranian suzerainty over the Caucasus following the ascension of Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, had eventually indefinitely lost all their territories in the North and South Caucasus during the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813) and Russo-Persian War (1826-1828). In 1828, after the Russian victory in the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828) and the ceding of the final Persian territories in the greater Caucasus region to Russia, Ivan Paskevich, then governor general in the newly conquered regions wrote a letter to St.Petersburg to propose that Mir-Fettakh a high Muslim cleric from Tabriz, Persia, should be made head of the Muslim ulema in the Caucasus. Russia had already created an assembly in 1794 in Crimea as an intention to connect the state with its Muslim subjects and their precise responsibilities being changed in response to demands from St.Petersburg. Paskevich hoped that by the help of Mir-Fettakh's high stature in the Muslim community, he could make a very valuable contribution to the Russian consolidation of power in the Caucasus. The Russians however did not seem aware this could cause a problem as Mir-Fettakh was a Shia, while the majority of the Muslims in the Caucasus were Sunni. On a related note, the Russian administration did realize eventually that only religious figures from the Caucasus could have significant influence in the region. Nevertheless, Mir-Fettakh was appointed head of this spiritual assembly in the entire Caucasus and he would continue to dominate the administration according his ideas for the next decade. He proved his worth many times as he kept the Shiite population quiet in the 1829 Murid uprisings in the North Caucasus, but even persuaded many to fight amongst the Russian ranks. However, things made a drastic turn when Paskevich was made to combat the Polish insurrection in 1831 in Warsaw. Under his successor, General Rosen, the Murid uprisings proved themselves to be capable of setting firm resistance under the rebellious Imam Shamil, which made the Russians reluctant to create a strong Muslim leader under its own auspices. Slowly but eventually, the power and hegemony of Mir-Fettakh as head of the Muslim community was decimated. After many petitions and misfortunes in his personal life, he returned to Persia in 1841. In 1839, Rosen was followed by Yevegni Golovin. He sealed the further future of the Caucasian Muslims. According to him, the sole reason why figures like Imam Shamil had only gained influence due to the corrupt rule of the khans appointed by the Qajar Dynasty who had ruled the regions quasi-independently for centuries. He and other members of the Caucasus administration would openly advocate a policy of making Islam decline and erode in the following years to come expecting a natural and eventual Russification. While being adviser to Ivan Paskevich and head of the Assembly, he lived in Tiflis, Georgia (then recently part of the Russian Empire) where he established a famous garden on the left bank of the Kura River (Mtkvari) known as the Mushthaid Garden. The disastrous events in the Caucasus which came some years after, are believed to be due to Paskevich's and Mir-Fatah's departures from office, and bad ruling policies of subsequent governor generals, which forced him to return to Tabriz in 1841. Soon after his departure, the situation in the Caucasus worsened with the rise of figures such as Imam Shamil and others. It would take Russia around 50 years to fully annex the North Caucasus.

All Aulonocara species are maternal mouth brooders. Particularly in the aquarium hobby, Aulonocara species are also known as peacock cichlids, aulonocaras or simply \\"peacocks\\". This genus is strongly sexually dichromic, even by haplochromine standards. As aquarium fish, they are best kept with other medium-sized nonaggressive cichlids from Lake Malawi. Peacock cichlids are known to be less aggressive than their Mbuna counterparts, and thrive in warmer waters that have a slightly basic pH.

He is known for his advocacy of the Green Party of England and Wales. Porritt frequently contributes to magazines, newspapers and books, and appears on radio and television. Early life Jonathon Porritt was born in London, the son of Arthur Porritt, Baron Porritt, 11th Governor-General of New Zealand and his second wife, Kathleen Peck. Lord Porritt, who served as a senior officer in the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War II, was also the bronze medalist in the 1924 Summer Olympics \\"Chariots of Fire\\" 100 metres race. As well as receiving a life peerage, Lord Porritt had previously been awarded a baronetcy in 1963. Jonathon Porritt therefore became the 2nd Baronet on Lord Porritt's death on 1 January 1994. Porritt was educated at Wellesley House School, Broadstairs, Kent; Eton College; and Magdalen College, University of Oxford, where he earned a first class degree in modern languages. Porritt started training as a barrister, but switched to teaching English at St Clement Danes Grammar School (later Burlington Danes School) in Shepherd's Bush, West London, in 1974. He taught there from 1974 to 1984, serving as Head of English from 1980 to 1984. In 1985 he married Sarah Staniforth CBE, daughter of Malcolm Arthur Staniforth. Environmental and political involvement The Green Party = In the 1970s and early 1980s, Porritt was a prominent member of the Ecology Party (now the Green Party of England and Wales). Porritt served as chair of The Ecology Party from 1979 to 1980, and from 1982 to 1984. He presided over changes that made the party much more prominent in elections, himself standing as a parliamentary candidate in general elections in 1979 and 1983. In 1979 he received 4.1% of the vote in London Central, receiving attention from national media. Under his stewardship, membership grew from a few hundred to around 3,000. In 1984, Porritt published his first book, Seeing Green: Politics of Ecology Explained. It was written while he was policy director of the Ecology Party. As of 1999, it was still described as \\"the best general guide to the politics of ecology by an 'insider'\\". Reviewed nearly 30 years after its publication, it stands up as \\"prophetic in many respects\\", although somewhat off in the timing of its predictions, perhaps in part because Porritt did not anticipate the rise of indebtedness. Writing before the rise of the internet, Porritt even predicted the development of an \\"information-rich, knowledge- poor\\" age. The Greens achieved 15% of the European Parliamentary vote in 1989, but were able to win only 1.2% of the vote in the 1992 general election, in which environmental issues were largely ignored. During this time Porritt became a strong public advocate of change in the Green Party. Along with Sara Parkin, he advocated for a more professional organisation with identifiable leaders, a change that was eventually approved. In 1992 Porritt backed the election of Cynog Dafis who was successfully elected to Parliament as the joint Plaid Cymru-Green MP for Ceredigion. However, in 1994, the regional council of the Green Party suspended Porritt for supporting Dafis, and demanded that Dafis stop identifying himself as Green. Between 1996 and 2009, Porritt largely withdrew from active party politics, concentrating instead on non-partisan and activist roles independent of the Green Party. In March 2009, Porritt spoke at the launch of the South West Green Party European Election campaign in Bristol, stating that he had always remained a member of the Green Party and that it was the correct time to reaffirm his support. He noted that many of the policies in the Ecology Party's manifesto of 1979 were now accepted by mainstream political parties, and emphasized the importance of active support. Prior to the 2015 general election, he was one of several public figures who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party's Caroline Lucas. =Friends of the Earth= In 1984 Porritt gave up teaching to become Director of Friends of the Earth in Britain, a post he held until 1990. Although criticized initially as inexperienced, in the long term he has been seen as an important factor in the group's success in the late 1980s. He edited the Friends of the Earth Handbook (1987) and encouraged Friends of the Earth to promote practical solutions in its local environmental campaigns, as well as thinking more globally and internationally. During his time as director, the membership of the organization expanded from 12,700 to 226,300. Looking back in 2012, Porritt stated that becoming director of Friends of the Earth \\"was probably the best decision of my life.\\" However, his affection for the organization has not stopped him from harshly criticizing it, as he did in 2015, when the group's top ten priority issues list did not include nuclear power. =Beyond Agenda 21= Porritt attended United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, eventually writing an introduction for The way forward : beyond Agenda 21 (1997). From 1993‚Äì1996 he chaired Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future, then known as United Nations Environment and Development UK (UNED UK). The organization encourages international stakeholders to engage in decision-making for sustainable development. =Forum for the Future= With Sara Parkin and Paul Ekins, Porritt founded Forum for the Future in 1996, a sustainable development charity. The nonprofit offers advice on sustainability planning to multinational companies including Kellogg's and Unilever. After founding Forum of the Future, Porritt largely withdrew from party politics to concentrate on non-partisan political work. =Sustainable Development Commission= In 2000 Porritt was appointed the inaugural Chair of the incoming Labour government's Sustainable Development Commission (SDC), set up by prime minister Tony Blair. He was reappointed twice for three-year terms, the last of which began 26 July 2006. From 2000 to 2009, Porritt chaired the SDC. He was, however, critical of the Labour government for its environmental record and its pro-nuclear stance, and has campaigned against nuclear power. While at SDC, Porritt encouraged the work of economist Tim Jackson, whose SDC report Prosperity Without Growth was later published as a book under the same title. Since retiring from the SDC in September 2009, Porritt has publicly supported the report's analysis of economic growth as it relates to environmental and human well-being, and the potential for a sustainable economy. The Sustainable Development Commission closed on 31 March 2011. =Population Matters= Porritt is a patron of the population concern charity Population Matters, (formerly known as the Optimum Population Trust). Porritt has stated that population growth is a serious threat to the global environment and that family planning, including both birth control and abortion, is a part of the answer to global warming. He recommends that people should have no more than two children. Porritt has asserted that \\"promotion of reproductive health is one of the most progressive forms of intervention\\" that could be used to reduce carbon emissions. Porritt's views are based in part on a 2009 report by Thomas Wire at the London School of Economics, commissioned by Optimum Population Trust. It compared the cost-effectiveness of access to family planning with other interventions such as low-carbon technologies, and concluded that access to family planning, by decreasing population and the subsequent human carbon footprint, could have a substantial impact on global warming. Similar views are supported by other researchers and international organizations. Porritt's remarks on the subject in 2009 caused outrage among anti-abortionists and some religious leaders. Porritt was also criticized for praising China for its 'one child family' policy, which has reduced birth rates but is described as coercive, cruel and causing \\"immeasurable suffering\\". Although the Green Party, Population Matters and other organizations assert that they only support voluntary use of family planning, calls for population control raise fears that it will be coercively used in ways that infringe human rights. Porritt remained definite about his position. Environmental commentator George Monbiot, who also uses carbon emissions for ecological footprinting, has criticized Porritt's emphasis on family planning. He asserts that radical family planning will have little impact unless people limit their consumption. \\"People might populate less as they become richer, but they do not consume less; rather they consume more. That is, as the habits of the super-rich show, there are no limits to human extravagance.\\" The carbon footprint of people in poorer countries has been shown to be much lower than that in wealthy countries. Increasing availability to contraceptive usage in poor countries, although it may have decrease population growth in those countries, may therefore do little to limit carbon impact. Porritt argues that this does not lessen the responsibility of wealthy countries to address population, asserting that population affects both the rich and poor worlds, and that \\"Every country needs a population strategy, including the US and the UK.\\" Porritt is also an advisor to Project Drawdown, which \\"maps, measures, models, and describes the 100 most substantive solutions to global warming\\". Among the top ten solutions, according to Project Drawdown, are the education of women and the availability of family planning services. =Other activities= Porritt served as chairman of Sustainability South-West, the South-West Round Table for Sustainable Development in England, from 1999 to 2001, and later as president. Porritt served as a trustee of the World Wildlife Fund (UK) from 1991‚Äì2005. Porritt is on the advisory board of BBC Wildlife magazine and actively supports the efforts of experts promoting renewable energy and sustainable development such as Walt Patterson. Porritt is an endorser of the Forests Now Declaration, presented at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting, held in Bali in December 2007. The Declaration calls for new market based carbon policies and reforms to prioritize the protection of tropical forests. Porritt has strongly criticized proposals by the UK government to sell off Britain's remaining 635,000 acres of public woodlands, and helped to form the organization Our Forests in 2012 to protect and expand public and private woodlands throughout England. Porritt acts as advisor to many bodies on environmental matters, as well as to individuals including Prince Charles. His best-selling book Capitalism: As if the World Matters was originally published in 2005, and revised and republished by Earthscan in September 2007. In it he argues that capitalism must be controlled and redirected to create a sustainable world. In line with this view, Porritt has worked to encourage businesses to move towards sustainability. As of 2004, Porritt became a Trustee of the Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy. In 2005 he became a Non-Executive Director of Wessex Water, and in 2008 he became a non-executive director for the Willmott Dixon Group. Porritt also serves on the Sustainable Retail Advisory Board for Marks & Spencer, advising the company on its long-term sustainability strategy. Porritt is a convenor of the cross-party political movement, More United. Porritt's book The World We Made (2013) is a futurist account of how the world will have changed by 2050, noted for both its comprehensiveness and optimism. Honours and awards In 2000, Jonathon Porritt was named a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE). Porritt became an honorary Doctor of Laws of the University of Sussex in 2000. Porritt received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2001. In July 2008, he became an honorary graduate of the University of Exeter. On 9 February 2012 he became Chancellor of Keele University.

It is a federally listed endangered species.Iowa Pleistocene Snail (Discus macclintocki). Endangered Species. USFWS Midwest Region. 2013. Biology This snail is limited to patches of algific talus slope habitat. It is a relict species from the last ice age. Much of its remaining habitat is located on the Driftless Area National Wildlife Refuge in Iowa. Known from fossil evidence about 400,000 years old, it is one of many glacial relict species that remain in the Driftless Area, a glacier-eroded plateau that now makes up parts of Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Much of the area was covered by glaciers about 500,000 years ago, while parts of the Driftless Area were unglaciated. The algific talus slope habitat that harbors the snail is a landscape cooled by air and water emerging from masses of subterranean ice. The ground temperature rarely exceeds 50 ¬∞F even in summer. Here the snail feeds on leaf litter from trees (mainly birch, maple and dogwood) and shrubs. During the winter, it burrows underground and becomes dormant. It breeds from March to August, laying two to six eggs in the litter. Juveniles emerge in about 28 days. The life span of the snail is 5 to 7 years. The adult is about 5-8 millimeters wide,Driftless Area National Wildlife Refuge: Wildlife & Habitat. USFWS. with a brownish or greenish shell. Conservation status The Iowa Pleistocene snail was thought to be extinct until it was discovered in 1955 by a scientist working in northeastern Iowa. It was listed as endangered by the United States in 1978. The main cause of the snail's decline is climate change, as it is restricted to patches of cold habitat in warmer surroundings. The snail is considered to be a relic of the ice age. About 75% of this snail‚Äôs original habitat has been destroyed since 1850. Other causes include loss of habitat to logging, quarrying, livestock, pesticides, the construction of roads, and predation by shrews.Discus macclintocki. Status of Listed Species and Recovery Plan Development. USGS. The International Union for Conservation of Nature assessed the snail as a species of least concern for the Red List, because its populations are apparently stable and none were lost in the decade prior to the assessment. Driftless Area National Wildlife Refuge The Driftless Area National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1989 to protect native flora and fauna, including endangered and threatened species such as the Iowa Pleistocene snail. The refuge conserves the algific talus slope habitat and other local habitat such as cold, moist sinkholes. Other glacial relict snails occur on the refuge, including the Midwest Pleistocene vertigo (Vertigo hubrichti). Rare plants include the northern blue monkshood (Aconitum noveboracense), which thrives in the same cool talus habitat as the snail.

He was the eldest son and the heir apparent to his father, Emperor Wu of Han, until his death at age 38 during the political turmoil that occurred during 91 BC. Contrary to his less- than-flattering posthumous name, Liu Ju was generally regarded by historians as a well-mannered, benevolent, morally upright man who, by circumstances beyond his control, was forced into an uprising against his father's army and died as a consequence of the rebellion.  Family background and birth  Liu Ju's mother, Wei Zifu, was Emperor Wu's second wife. Emperor Wu's first wife, Empress Chen Jiao, had long lost the Emperor's favour due to infertility, as well as her spoilt and jealous personality. When Empress Chen was found employing witchcraft to curse Emperor Wu's other concubines (aimed at Wei Zifu in particular), she was officially deposed in 130 BC, leaving open the position of empress. Wei Zifu, who had been Emperor Wu's favourite consort since 138 BC, had by then already bore him three daughters. In 128 BC, she gave birth to Liu Ju, Emperor Wu's first son, and was created empress as a result. It was recorded that Emperor Wu, who was already 29 years old when his first son was born, was overjoyed and ordered poets to write paeans celebrating the arrival of the \\"grand prince\\", hinting Liu Ju would become his imperial heir by default. Prince Ju was later formally created crown prince in 122 BC, at the age of 6.  As crown prince  Emperor Wu had high hopes for Prince Ju, and made sure he got the best education possible, even constructing the \\"Broad Vision Academy\\" (ÂçöÊúõËãë) to allow his son exposure to all schools of scholars. It is unclear when Liu Ju become involved in government affairs, but as he matured and Emperor Wu began to take more time away from the capital, from 113 BC he was entrusted as the prince regent while his father was absent. His mother Empress Wei, whose sexual attraction decreased in the eyes of Emperor Wu, was still entrusted to look after domestic palace affairs. Both Liu Ju and Empress Wei remained well respected by Emperor Wu. Unlike Emperor Wu, who was at times megalomanic and always looking for territorial expansion which burdened his people to their limit, Liu Ju was regarded as a man of peace, interested more in the social well-being and economic recovery of the people, and openly opposed his father on many policies. He was well known for his hospitality and openness to different opinions, and he maintained a large group of advisers and friends at his palace. Because Liu Ju favoured more lenient policies and often helped overturn wrongful convictions. He frequently had conflicts with legal officials who had received promotions from following his father's harsher, more authoritarian policies. In 113 BC, Liu Ju married his only well-known consort, Lady Shi (Âè≤ËâØÂ®£), who bore him a son Liu Jin (ÂäâÈÄ≤). Liu Jin would later produce a young grandson, who was only months old when his entire family were killed during the 91 BC political turmoil. Liu Ju also had two other sons and a daughter. While Liu Ju's well-respected uncle, General Wei Qing was alive, Crown Prince Ju was safe politically. After Wei Qing died in 106 BC, certain officials and factions started plotting against Liu Ju.  Forced into rebellion  Near the end of his reign, the physically deteriorating Emperor Wu became increasingly paranoid and fearful of others using witchcraft against him, especially after incidents involving the sighting/hallucination of an armed stranger walking by as well as a nightmare of hundreds of small wooden puppets beating him with sticks. A massive crackdown was ordered and those who were suspected of witchcraft were often summarily executed along with their entire clans. Many important people became victims of this witch-hunt, which peaked during early 91 BC, including the entire family of Prime Minister Gongsun He (ÂÖ¨Â≠´Ë≥Ä, Liu Ju's maternal uncle-in- law), Liu Ju's sisters (and Emperor Wu's own daughters) Princesses Yangshi (ÈôΩÁü≥ÂÖ¨‰∏ª) and Princess Zhuyi (Ë´∏ÈÇëÂÖ¨‰∏ª), as well as Wei Qing's son Wei Kang (Ë°õÂøº), effectively removing almost all of the Crown Prince's political supporters in the Han court. Furthermore, Emperor Wu's favourite concubine was now the young Lady Zhao (Ë∂ôÂ©ïÂ¶§), who was also known as \\"Lady Fist\\" (Êã≥Â§´‰∫∫) or \\"Lady Hook\\" (Èâ§ÂºãÂ§´‰∫∫) due to legend that she was born with a contractured clenched fist, which somehow magically opened up when Emperor Wu massaged it, revealing a jade hook in the palm. She gave birth to Emperor Wu's youngest son Liu Fuling after a rumoured 14-month-long pregnancy, same as the legendary Emperor Yao. Overjoyed that he could still father a son with such divine implications at the age of 66, the superstitious Emperor Wu named Lady Zhao's household the \\"Gate of Yao's Mother\\" (Â†ØÊØçÈñÄ). This gesture did not go unnoticed, and speculations started to rise that he intended to replace Liu Ju with the 3-year-old Prince Fuling as the new crown prince. Such speculation fuelled further conspiracies to dethrone Liu Ju. One of the conspirators against Crown Prince Ju was Jiang Chong (Ê±üÂÖÖ), the ruthless and opportunistic head of the secret intelligence, who once had a run-in with Prince Ju after arresting one of Prince Ju's assistants for improper use of an imperial right of way. Fearing that with Emperor Wu's health declining, Crown Prince Ju would one day ascend to the throne and punish him for their past clashes, Jiang Chong decided that he had to remove the Crown Prince once and for all. One other conspirator was Emperor Wu's chief eunuch Su Wen (ËòáÊñá), who had falsely and repeatedly accused Liu Ju of committing adultery with Emperor Wu's junior concubines. Su Wen also blocked any attempts by Liu Ju and Empress Wei to communicate with Emperor Wu, who was then staying at his summer palace in Ganquan (ÁîòÊ≥â, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). In the same year, Jiang Chong and Su Wen decided to move against Liu Ju, once again using witchcraft as an excuse. Jiang, with the approval of Emperor Wu, searched through various palaces, ostensibly for witchcraft items, eventually reaching Empress Wei and Liu Ju's household. Jiang's men dug holes everywhere, leaving barely room for the Empress and Crown Prince to lay their beds. Jiang Chong then planted dolls and pieces of cloth with mysterious writing in Liu Ju's palace, and then announced that he found evidence of witchcraft. Liu Ju, initially believing that he had nothing to hide, was shocked and forced to consider his options, and his teacher Shi De (Áü≥Âæ∑), invoking the story of Zhao Gao's plot to murder Ying Fusu and raising the possibility that Emperor Wu might already be deceased, suggested that Liu Ju should start an uprising to remove Jiang. Liu Ju initially hesitated and wanted to speedily proceed to Ganquan Palace and explain himself to his father, but he found out that Jiang's messengers were already on their way to report the \\"crime\\". So he decided to accept Shi's suggestion. Liu Ju arranged for one of his men to impersonate a messenger from Emperor Wu and arrest Jiang Chong's party. However, Su Wen managed to escape arrest. After they were subdued, Liu Ju personally executed Jiang. He then reported his actions to his mother, who authorised him the right to mobilise her palace guards and distribute weapons to any civilian supporters he could muster in preparation to defend himself against any retaliation from Jiang's co-conspirators. Meanwhile, Su Wen fled to Ganquan Palace and told Emperor Wu that the Crown Prince was going to overthrow him in a rebellion. Emperor Wu, refusing to believe his benevolent son would commit treason and (correctly at this point) concluding that Prince Ju was merely angry at Jiang Chong. So the Emperor decided to send a low-ranking eunuch to the capital Chang'an to summon Prince Ju to provide an explanation for his actions. This messenger did not dare to proceed to Chang'an, but instead falsely reported to Emperor Wu that he fled because Prince Ju was going to kill him. By now enraged, Emperor Wu ordered his nephew, Prime Minister Liu Qumao (ÂäâÂ±àÁäõ), to put down the rebellion. Prince Ju also sent two messengers in attempts to mobilise regular armies. One was sent to a detachment of surrendered Xiongnu cavalry stationed outside the capital, but Emperor Wu's messenger had arrived just earlier and ordered the cavalry to attack Prince Ju instead. The other messenger was sent to the North Army in charge of guarding the capital, but the commander-in-charge, Ren An (‰ªªÂÆâ), refused to get involved. Without regular army support, Prince Ju's forces, consisting only palace guards and armed civilians, were no match for Liu Qumao's army. Furthermore, after Emperor Wu's banner was displayed outside the capital city, it became clear that Emperor Wu was still in charge and Prince Ju did not have his father's authorisation. So public support for the Crown Prince disappeared. The two sides then battled in the streets of Chang'an for five days, and Liu Qumao's forces prevailed. Prince Ju was forced to flee the capital with two of his sons. His mother, Empress Wei, committed suicide after Emperor Wu sent messengers to seize her seal as a punishment of supporting her son's uprising. The rest of Prince Ju's family were then killed, with the only exception of the months-old grandson Liu Bingyi, who was thrown into prison. Emperor Wu ordered that Prince Ju be hunted down, but after a junior official, Linghu Mao (‰ª§ÁãêËåÇ), risked his life and spoke on Prince Ju's behalf, Emperor Wu's anger began to subside, but he had not yet issued a pardon for his son. At this point, Liu Ju had fled to Hu County (ÊπñÁ∏£, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan) and took refuge in the home of a poor shoemaker. Knowing the financial burden imposed on his warm-hearted host, Liu Ju attempted to seek help from an old friend living in Hu County, but this exposed his whereabouts. Local officials quickly tracked down and surrounded the house. Seeing no chance of escape, Liu Ju committed suicide by hanging. His two sons and the family hosting them all died when government soldiers finally broke in and killed everyone. The officials in charge, Li Shou (ÊùéÂ£Ω) and Zhang Fuchang (ÂºµÂØåÊòå), then wasted no times to take Liu Ju's body to Chang'an and claim rewards from Emperor Wu, who had to keep his word despite great sorrow over his son's death.  Posthumous developments  Eventually, Emperor Wu began to realize that the witchcraft cases during 91 BC were often false accusations. In 89 BC, when Tian Qianqiu (Áî∞ÂçÉÁßã), then the superintendent of Emperor Gao's temple, filed a report claiming that \\"a white-haired old man\\" told him in a dream that for the offence of armed uprising, Prince Ju would at most be caned, not killed, as a punishment, Emperor Wu realised what had really happened. Furious that the conspirators had abused his trust and plotted his son's death, he had Su Wen burned alive, Jiang Chong's immediate and extended family executed, and killed every official who had received promotions for tracking down the Crown Prince. He also promoted Tian Qianqiu to prime minister, and made major policy changes that supported the ideals supported by his dead son. To express his regret over causing his son's death, Emperor Wu also built the Palace of Son-Grieving (ÊÄùÂ≠êÂÆÆ) and Platform of Longing for Return (Ê≠∏‰æÜÊúõÊÄùÂè∞), officially rehabilitating Liu Ju's name. Liu Ju's only surviving offspring, his grandson Liu Bingyi, would eventually become emperor (as Emperor Xuan) in 74 BC following the death of Crown Prince Ju's childless younger brother Emperor Zhao and a brief reign by their nephew, Prince He of Changyi. Out of respect for Emperor Zhao, Emperor Xuan did not initially attempt to restore the title of his grandfather. It was not until 73 BC that he restored Crown Prince Ju's title (but with the rather unflattering posthumous name of \\"Li\\", which means \\"unrepentant\\") and reburied his grandparents and parents.

It was located just north of the Westchester bluffs and district of Los Angeles, California, from 1940 until its closure in 1985. It was directly south of and along Jefferson Boulevard and Ballona Creek, the location of the present day planned community development of Playa Vista. History In 1940, Howard Hughes bought of the Ballona wetlands south of Jefferson Avenue in south-west Culver City. A total of were available for a runway and an unpaved runway 23/5 was operational in 1943. In 1948, were paved with asphalt, extended by 1962 to . Takeoffs to the west had to be coordinated with nearby Los Angeles International Airport. The field served a number of aircraft and helicopter development projects of the Hughes Aircraft Co. and Hughes Tool Company (Summa Corporation). At one time, according to Noah Dietrich, it \\"was the longest runway on the West Coast.\\" Spruce Goose The \\"Spruce Goose\\", officially known as the Hughes H-4 Hercules, was built here and moved in sections to the Port of Long Beach where it was re-assembled and made its first and only flight. Afterward, a climate controlled hangar was built there, where it remained until 1980 when it was acquired by the Aero Club of Southern California, which put it on display under a large dome next to the Queen Mary until 1988 when it was sold to the Evergreen Aviation Museum where it sits today. A full-time crew of 300 workers, all sworn to secrecy, maintained the plane in flying condition in a climate-controlled hangar at the Port of Long Beach location. The crew was reduced to 50 workers in 1962 and then disbanded after Hughes's death in 1976. By the mid-1990s, the former Hughes Aircraft hangars here, including the one that held the Hercules, were converted into sound stages. Scenes from movies such as Titanic, What Women Want, and End of Days have been filmed in the aircraft hangar where Hughes created the flying boat. It also features in the computer game Crimson Skies. The hangar will be preserved as a structure eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Buildings.

Celia Kitzinger Kitzinger is Professor of Conversation Analysis, Gender and Sexuality in the Department of Sociology at the University of York. She has a career in academia, having published nine books and contributed over one hundred articles relating to language, feminism and homosexual issues. Kitzinger earned a MA degree from the University of Oxford and a PhD from the University of Reading. After having served from 1999‚Äì2000 as Visiting Professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, she accepted her current post at York. Kitzinger is qualified as a chartered psychologist within the British Psychological Society (BPS), of which she was elected fellow in 1997. Furthermore, the American Psychological Association has also honoured her by accepting her as fellow in 2000. The BPS awarded Kitzinger the 2016 Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of her contributions to social justice and the psychology of sexualities. Currently, Professor Kitzinger is using conversation analysis to explore the ordinary mundane reproduction of heterosexism in everyday talk-in-interaction, and aside from her work at the University of York she also serves as associate editor of Feminism & Psychology. Sue Wilkinson Wilkinson is an emeritus Professor of Feminist and Health Studies in the Department of Social Sciences at Loughborough University in Leicestershire. Wilkinson completed her undergraduate studies at the University of Leicester, graduating with a BSc degree in psychology. From there, she proceeded to earn a PhD specialising in gender issues, particularly regarding the role of women in psychology. Wilkinson's first academic post was as a lecturer at the University of Liverpool; following this she took position as Head of the Psychology department at Coventry University. After Coventry, Wilkinson accepted a research post at the University of Hull, then left this post to accept a Visiting Professorship at the University of Waikato. After this position in 1999, Wilkinson was granted a full professorship at Loughborough, having been associated with the university since 1994. Despite this, Professor Wilkinson decided to accept a sabbatical between 2001 and 2002; she spent this year firstly working at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and then serving as a visiting scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles. The following year she took special leave to take chair as the Ruth Wynn Woodward Endowed Professor of Women's Studies at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada. It was whilst in Canada that Professor Kitzinger and Professor Wilkinson decided to marry. Wilkinson has received great recognition as an accomplished academic, and has a strong involvement with the British Psychological Society, being instrumental in the foundation of its Psychology of Women section, for which she served as the first head, and also its Lesbian and Gay Psychology section. Wilkinson is currently researching the expression of emotions in talk-in-interaction, as part of her role at Loughborough. Wilkinson has co-authored four books with Kitzinger, and serves as the editor of the academic journal Feminism & Psychology. Marriage status The couple married in Yaletown, Vancouver, in August 2003, a few weeks after same-sex marriage became legal in British Columbia, where Wilkinson had been working as a Visiting Professor at Simon Fraser University. On their return to the UK, the couple discovered that their relationship had no legal status at all. Two years later, with the implementation of the Civil Partnership Act, the relationship was automatically converted to a civil partnership. The couple sued for the recognition of their marriage, the trial beginning on 5 June 2006 before Sir Mark Potter, President of the Family Division. For an overseas marriage to be recognised in the UK, it must be shown that the marriage was legal, recognised in the country in which it was executed, and that nothing in the country's law restricted freedom to marry; Kitzinger and Wilkinson argued that their marriage fulfilled these requirements even though people cannot legally enter into same-sex marriages in the UK. They rejected entering a civil partnership, believing them to be both symbolically and practically a lesser substitute, and asked the court to recognise their overseas marriage in the same way that it would recognise the marriage of an opposite-sex couple. They argued that a failure to do so breached their human rights under Articles 8 (right to respect for privacy and family life), 12 (right to marry) and 14 (prohibition of discrimination), taken together with Article 8 and/or 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which was incorporated into domestic UK law by the Human Rights Act 1998. In a 21 September 2005 press release issued by Liberty, the British civil rights organisation which supported their case, Kitzinger and Wilkinson said: > This is fundamentally about equality. We want our marriage to be recognised > as a marriage - just like any other marriage made in Canada. It is insulting > and discriminatory to be offered a civil partnership instead. Civil > partnerships are an important step forward for same-sex couples, but they > are not enough. We want full equality in marriage. James Welch, Legal Director at Liberty, said: > Our clients entered into a legal marriage in Canada. It is a matter of > fairness and equality that they should be treated the same way as any other > couple who marries abroad: their marriage should be recognised here. They > shouldn't have to settle for the second-best option of a civil partnership. The High Court announced its judgement on 31 July 2006, finding that the marriage would continue to be recognised as a civil partnership in England and Wales, but not as a marriage.BBC News: Lesbians lose legal marriage bid In handing down his ruling, the President of the Family Division, Sir Mark Potter, gave as his reason that \\"Abiding single sex relationships are in no way inferior, nor does English Law suggest that they are by according them recognition under the name of civil partnership\\"BBC News: Lesbians lose legal marriage bid (video) and that marriage was an \\"age-old institution\\" which, he suggested, was by \\"longstanding definition and acceptance\\" a relationship between a man and a woman. He described this as an \\"insurmountable hurdle\\" to the couple's case. While agreeing that they were discriminated against by the Civil Partnership Act 2004, he considered that \\"To the extent that by reason of that distinction it discriminates against same-sex partners, such discrimination has a legitimate aim, is reasonable and proportionate, and falls within the margin of appreciation accorded to Convention States.\\"Wilkinson v Kitzinger & Ors [2006] EWHC 2022 (Fam) (31 July 2006), paragraph 122 The Attorney General, as Second Respondent, sought ¬£25,000 in costs. The couple announced their intention to appeal against the decision of the High Court, but later abandoned this due to lack of funds. On 13 March 2014, their overseas marriage was recognised by the Government as a legal marriage as the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 came into force.The Guardian: Gay couple who wed overseas celebrate in UK as same-sex marriage law arrives See also *Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom *Obergefell v.

The forest is broken into several separate sections and extends over . To the east the forest borders Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park and Bridger‚ÄìTeton National Forest. Most of the forest is a part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Description Caribou and Targhee National Forests were combined from original forest lands created in 1891. Two designated wilderness areas are located in the easternmost sections of the forest, bordering on National Park lands. The Jedediah Smith Wilderness is adjacent to Grand Teton National Park on the western slope of the Teton Range. Known for karst limestone formations, the wilderness has many caves and provides excellent views of the less often seen west face of the Teton peaks. The smaller Winegar Hole Wilderness borders Yellowstone National Park and the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway, and was set aside primarily to protect prime grizzly bear habitat. While western sections of the forest have a mixture of sagebrush and grasses, the higher elevations in the east support lodgepole pine, and numerous species of spruce and fir. In addition to grizzlies most of the major megafauna associated with Yellowstone National Park can be found in Caribou‚ÄìTarghee National Forest. Mammalian species of black bear, wolf, elk, moose, mule deer, bison, cougar, and pronghorn have all been seen by visitors on forest lands. An active peregrine falcon recovery program was begun to return this bird species to some of their ancestral range. Cutthroat trout, brook trout and pike are found in the streams and lakes and the forest is considered one of the best fishing areas in the world for cutthroat trout. Minnetonka Cave is one of only two caves administered by the U.S. Forest Service Dozens of campgrounds and 1,600 miles (2,500 km) of trails allow access to much of the forest. There are two trails that access the high altitude Alaska Basin immediately west of the main Teton Range peaks and allow access to trails in Grand Teton National Park. Caribou National Forest, the smaller and more southerly of the two, is located in southeastern Idaho, western Wyoming, and northern Utah, and has a total area of . There are local ranger district offices located in Malad City, Montpelier, Pocatello, and Soda Springs in Idaho. The larger and more northerly Targhee National Forest is located in eastern Idaho and northwestern Wyoming, and has an area of .Table 6 - NFS Acreage by State, Congressional District and County - United States Forest Service - September 30, 2007 There are local ranger district offices located in Ashton, Driggs, Dubois, and Island Park in Idaho. In Island Park is Big Springs (Idaho), a first-magnitude spring that is the source of the South Fork of Henrys Fork. Linkage of limited habitat, through ecological corridors, is the current, most favored, method of effectively restoring native wildlife communities. Many such corridors have been identified where wildlife conservation is a concern. The montane nature of the Caribou National Forest and its juxtaposition make it a very important, fragile and unique link between the northern and southern Rocky Mountains. If restoration of native species is to be achieved throughout the wildlands of the American West, the Caribou will play an important role. The combined Caribou‚ÄìTarghee National Forest is managed by the Forest Service from offices in Idaho Falls, Idaho. Wilderness areas There are two officially designated wilderness areas within the Caribou‚ÄìTarghee National Forest that are part of the National Wilderness Preservation System.
