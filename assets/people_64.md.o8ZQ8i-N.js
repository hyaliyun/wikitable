The ecoregion includes the lowland rain forests on New Britain, New Ireland, and nearby smaller islands, including Umboi, Long Island, and Karkar, near the New Guinea coast west of New Britain. The islands north of New Ireland, including New Hanover (Lavongai), the Saint Matthias Group, Tabar Group, Lihir Group, Tanga Islands, and Feni Islands, are also part of the ecoregion.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J.

New Britain is the largest island in the ecoregion, with an area of 36,520 km¬≤. New Ireland is the second-largest, with an area of 7,404 km¬≤. The archipelago is mostly made of volcanic rocks, with extensive areas of limestone. Several of the ecoregion's volcanoes are still active. The islands are generally mountainous, with Mount Ulawun on New Britain reaching 2,334 m (7,657 ft).

Paul opposes the bill's language for being overly broad, including attacks which he felt were not extreme enough to qualify as \\"lynching\\", stating that \\"this bill would cheapen the meaning of lynching by defining it so broadly as to include a minor bruise or abrasion\\" and has proposed an amendment that would apply a \\"serious bodily injury standard\\" for a crime to be considered as lynching.

It is used by bilateral and multilateral donors, development banks, NGOs, the private sector and individual professionals. Globally it competes with Devex.com and ReliefWeb.int. Origin and development In 2006, DevelopmentAid CEO and founder Luc Vocks established a recruitment agency focused on international development. This recruitment agency provided services to a wide range of experts and organizations, creating connections to many actors in international development who would later join the new platform. In 2007, in order to expand the recruitment firm, cooperation was sought with existing online platforms. Most of these attempts were unsuccessful, as many platforms did not accept recruitment companies as members. That is why the decision was taken to set up a new platform. Whilst retaining the recruitment company, the online platform was launched in 2008. The platform had a slow start and took a few years to mature into a business. In 2010, in order to get more traction in the market, the company started to classify and provide information about companies and experts working in the development cooperation sector in a structured format. In 2015, the platform became noticeably dominant in its niche, servicing over 1000 member organizations. On October 25, 2016, DevelopmentAid launched a news streaming facility as part of the platform. It has since streamed over 15,000 articles, which include both cross-posted, as well as original content. The organization recently announced a new application called TenderWell.App. This application is meant to help manage tender acquisitions. For the project, a grant was received through Tekwill from USAID and the Government of Sweden. Organization The DevelopmentAid.org portal is owned by DEVAID LTD from Cyprus. DEVAID maintains a substantial back-office in Moldova where most of the day-to-day work takes place. Approximately 150 people are currently engaged at the DevelopmentAid.org portal. These are spread over Cyprus, Moldova, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. The company also employs freelancers from other countries who contribute content to the platform, mostly in the form of news articles.

The slogan was used as early as 1986, following the murder of Michael Griffith at the hands of mob of white youths.  History  Graffiti during the 1992 Los Angeles riots after the acquittal of white police officers in the beating of Rodney King Linguist Ben Zimmer writes that use of the slogan \\"No justice, no peace\\" during protests goes back as far as the 1986 murder of Michael Griffith. Griffith, a Trinidadian immigrant, and three friends, all black, were assaulted by a mob of white youth in the Howard Beach, Queens, New York City. Griffith fled the attackers onto a nearby highway, where he was fatally struck by a passing car. In 2014, civil-rights activist Al Sharpton recounted: \\"In the midst of the protest, someone yelled the slogan, 'No justice, no peace'. Others began doing the same, and from then on I adopted it as a rallying cry each and every time a grave miscarriage of justice has befallen the disenfranchised.\\" Other sources suggest that the phrase was actually popularized by activist Robert \\"Sonny\\" Carson, who is quoted on February 12, 1987 as stating, \\"'No justice! No peace!' [...] 'No peace for all of you who dare kill our children if they come into your neighborhood...We are going to make one long, hot summer out here...get ready for a new black in this city!,\\" while the New York Times reported on July 6, 1987: \\"'No justice, no peace,' said Mr. Carson repeatedly in what he said he hopes will emerge as the rallying cry for his cause.\\" Carson appears to have used the phrase conditionally (). The 1992 Los Angeles riots, sometimes termed the \\"Los Angeles uprising\\", are remembered for the use of the slogan, which expressed collective frustration with the existing social and economic order. = \\"...No racist police\\" = Protestors chanting \\"No justice, no peace, no more racist police\\" in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, after the death of George Floyd The variant \\"No justice, no peace, no racist police\\" has been recorded in print since at least 1995. This followed the murder of Joseph Gould, a homeless black man, by an off-duty white Chicago police officer, who fled the scene of the crime while Gould lay dying.  Conditional or conjunctive  The meaning of \\"no justice, no peace\\" may change between conditional and conjunctive depending on the speaker. In the conditional interpretation, the slogan is rendered as an \\"if-then\\" statement, which implies that peaceful action is impossible without justice, and which urges citizens to demonstrate against injustice even if doing so results in violence. After the 2014 shooting of Tamir Rice, journalist Glen Ford wrote: Zimmer writes that during the 1980s and '90s, No justice, no peace' was unequivocally understood as conditional, not conjunctive\\", such as in a 1988 statement by lawyer Ron Kuby before the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Criminal Justice: By contrast, in the conjunctive interpretation, one is stating that neither peace or justice can exist without the other. After the acquittal in the Trayvon Martin murder case, the chaplain of the University of Pennsylvania said, \\"A lack of justice has resulted in a lack of peace\\", \\"Heavy hearts now lack peace because of the lack of justice in our nation\\", and \\"No peace because of no justice.\\" Sharpton writes, No justice, no peace' [...] is a way to expose inequality that would otherwise be ignored.\\" Similar phrases In 1967, Martin Luther King, Jr. visited Santa Rita Jail in California, where protesters against the Vietnam War were imprisoned. There, he drew an explicit parallel between the anti-war movement and the Civil Rights Movement. Using a phrase that is explicitly conjunctive, King said, \\"There can be no justice without peace. And there can be no peace without justice.\\" King had previously used the same phrase in a letter to Willem Visser 't Hooft following King's receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize, and in a 1965 television appearance where he reaffirmed his call for an end to the war, stating: During the January 1972 World Day of Peace celebrations, Pope Paul VI said, \\"If you want peace, work for justice.\\" Another variant of the phrase is \\"know justice, know peace\\".

In 2013, Haresco decided to run and won as a district representative of the Lone District of Aklan in the 16th Congress of the Philippines. In 2016, he ran again for the same position but lost to former Aklan Governor Carlito Marquez during the Philippine's May 2016 Elections.

History  Sugarfactory's building is a former sugar refinery. This building and the rest of the steet block between Stadsschouwburg, Lijnbaansgracht and Leidsegracht has been used by De Granaatappel as sugar refinery since at least 1854. After multiple city expansions, by 1920 the refinery found itself located in what was now the centre of Amsterdam. This and the competition and crisis after World War I, led to the refinary shutting down and selling its equipment and buildings in September of 1920. The building on the Lijnbaansgracht was bought by cookie company De Lindeboom. By the late 1970s, the building was renovated to provide studio spaces for art and later theatre rehearsals. In 2005, Sugarfactory acquired the building and positioned itself as an alternative nightspot. Manne van der Zee became director of Sugarfactory in 2012.

Early life Clarke was the daughter of Ivy and Herbert Brookes, and granddaughter of Australian prime minister Alfred Deakin. Her father was a businessman, philanthropist, and activist who served as president of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures. Her mother Ivy was a gifted musician, active with national and international councils of women and Melbourne Women's Hospital. Clarke completed an Arts/Social Work degree at the University of Melbourne, where her mother served on several faculty boards, before doing further studies in New York. Career While in New York, Clarke was offered a position as junior delegate to the League of Nations Union in Geneva. In 1934, at just twenty years old, Clarke wore a spectacular costume representing the State of Victoria in The Pageant of Nations, a centenary celebration of European arrival in Victoria. The pageant was an initiative of the International Club of Victoria led by Clarke's mother, Ivy. The celebrations featured a visit from Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. Clarke's dress was painted with scenes of Melbourne, with a cloak representing the State's irrigation scheme, and a headdress representing the Yallourn Power Station. She later donated the hand- painted skirt, two hooped petticoats, and the green velvet cloak to the State Library Victoria. The headdress and bodice were destroyed in the Ash Wednesday fires of 1983. After serving in Switzerland, Clarke later returned to Australia before the outbreak of the Second World War. She was a welfare officer with the Victorian International Refugee Emergency Council when Sir Frank Clarke made negative comments about refugees when addressing the Australian Women's National League. She took him to task for his remarks on \\"rat-faced refugees.\\" Clarke married his son, William Anthony Francis Clarke, a few days after the outbreak of war. Clarke worked as a voluntary social worker with the Lord Mayor's Patriotic and Welfare Fund, helping with the issues of army wives and relatives in Sydney, and later in Melbourne, where her husband was stationed. =Nappie Wash= Jessie and William Clarke, along with Mary Adam and Harold Moran, started a napkin wash service in 1946 in response to the post war baby boom.

If the person is living, this is done via their ORCID iD, and if dead, via their Wikidata identifier. The specimen data associated with, and used by, Bionomia are the aggregated GBIF data. This mechanism of contributing to specimen data arose from a project initiated by the Mus√©um national d‚Äôhistoire naturelle, Paris (MNHN) in March 2019, and is motivated (in part) by \\"the world-wide importance of natural history collections, (which) are at risk because they are critically underfunded or undervalued. A contributing factor for this apparent neglect is the lack of a professional reward system that quantifies and illustrates the breadth and depth of expertise required to collect and identify specimens, maintain them, digitize their labels, mobilize the data, and enhance these data as errors and omissions are identified by stakeholders.\\" It is also motivated by the fact that the important work of taxonomists in identifying specimens in collections across the world fails to be recognised, and this failure, fails both institutions and taxonomists. In August 2018, Bionomia was launched (under the name Bloodhound Tracker) as a submission to the Ebbe Nielsen Challenge. Other papers which set the scene, the rationale and the purpose of Bionomia are: The primary task in Bionomia is to resolve the name strings of the various collectors and the taxonomists who have determined the species of a specimen into unique human beings. This having been done, the records of plant and animal specimens contained in GBIF downloads (permanently referenced by DOIs), together with the papers derived from them, and linked to the Bionomia people profiles. Hence, the taxonomic work fundamental to plant research can be tracked back to both the holding institution and to the taxonomist, linking institution, taxonomist, and the science generated. Thus, Bionomia, by quantifying taxonomists' contributions, allows their work to be counted, not only in terms of specimen counts, but also in terms of counts of scientific papers.  Contributing  To attribute collection/identification data in Bionomia and to see the profile data of collectors/identifiers, a person needs to be logged on to the Bionomia site via an ORCID id (preferably public). Collector profiles are by default private, which means that the profile of any living person who has contributed to specimen data aggregated by GBIF cannot be seen until the particular collector/identifier makes their profile public. A private profile means that a collector's data is neither visible nor verifiable by others. (However, one can attribute specimens to that person.) On pressing \\"Help Attribute\\" for a profile, GBIF specimen records with strings forming part of the person's name appear. Sometimes it is clear from the collector/identifier string, the date, the institution and the country in which it was collected, that the specimen should be attributed to the person. Often, however, all the data transcribed for the specimen must be examined, and there may also be a reasonably high resolution photograph of the specimen itself together with all its annotations over the years. enabling one to accept or reject the specimen as having been collected by the person. When one is examining the specimen, one is in the GBIF database itself, and when one notes an error, it is possible to notify the problem by email to the curator of the institution which provided the data.  Examples  Living people = For example, Kevin Thiele's profile on Bionomia shows that he has determined (identified) some 11,291 botanical specimens from at least 12 countries, collected some 4,797 specimens collected from at least 4 countries, and that 21 of these specimens (identified or collected) have been used in 10 published papers, and that as of June 5, 2020, there remain a further 6% of specimens which may or may not have been collected or identified by him. Pressing on the tab \\"Specialities\\" shows that he has collected 542 Myrtaceae specimens and 459 Poaceae specimens, while identifying 3829 Dilleniaceae and 2916 Rhamnaceae specimens. The tab \\"Deposited At\\" reveals that the specimens he has collected are spread across 22 institutions. Shelley James' profile shows she has determined 2836 botanical specimens from at least 20 countries, collected 3522 from 5 countries, and that 4457 of the specimens she has identified or collected have been used in 33 scientific papers, while Stylianos Chatzimanolis (a beetle systematist) has collected 31,493 specimens identified from at least 38 countries, 33,667 specimens collected from at least 15 countries, of which 6 have been used in 3 scientific papers. = Earlier collectors = Mary Ann McHard, a Western Australian pioneer, who collected for Ferdinand von Mueller (and whose profile is also public) is seen to have collected at least 2072 extant specimens, and these still contribute to scientific knowledge with 12 of her specimens contributing to a scientific paper. Hermann Beckler, who collected in Australia between 1856 and 1862, has 3179 extant specimens collected by him, some supposedly collected in the US (source GBIF), (thus illustrating the power of this project/website in that transcription and interpretation errors made in databasing specimens may be noticed and corrected.)

Systematics  The species was first described by French entomologist Gaston Allard in 1867. He initially named the species Lycaena martini. The type specimen was from Lambaesis, in Algeria. The species was placed in the genus Plebejus, and the subgenus Plebejides, but was later moved to the genus Kretania, along with other species placed in Plebejides.  Subspecies  Several subspecies have been described.Les Rhopaloc√®res du Parc Naturel d'Ifrane. * Kretania martini martini (Allard, 1867) ‚Äî from Algeria * Kretania martini ungemachi (Rothschild, 1926) ‚Äî from the High Atlas and the Middle Atlas mountains of Morocco * Kretania martini mgouna (Tarrier, 2002) ‚Äî from the M'Goun mountain in Morocco * Kretania martini regularis (Tennent, 1995) ‚Äî from the Rif region of Morocco  Description  The imago of the species is a small butterfly which is sexually dimorphic. The top of the male is blue purple with a thin black border and a white fringe, while that of the female is dark brown with a blue basal suffusion, white fringe, and a series of orange submarginal half moons and black marginal spots on the hindwings. The underside of the wings is beige gray decorated with black spots circled in white, with a series of orange submarginal half moons bordered by black and white chevrons, and a series of black marginal spots. The ornamentation resembles a similar species, Kretania allardii.  Biology  Phenology = The species emerges from May to late June. = Host plants = Plants that host the species include Astragalus massiliensis and Acanthyllis numidia for K. m. martini, Astragalus incanus incurvus for K. m. ungemachi and Astragalus armatus for K. m. regularis. Astragalus alopecuroides and Astragalus nemorosus also host the species. The catepillars exist in myrmecophily with ants from the genus Crematogaster.

It is situated in the Cascade Range, northwest of Mount Adams, northeast of Mount Saint Helens, and south of Mount Rainier. Its nearest higher neighbor is Burnt Rock, to the southeast, and Jumbo Peak lies to the south-southwest. Precipitation runoff from Sunrise Peak drains into tributaries of the Cowlitz River drainage basin. The Sunrise Trail (#262) and Juniper Ridge Trail (#261, #261A) provide access to this remote peak, with minor scrambling at the summit. Geology The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity occurred. Mount Adams, a stratovolcano that is southeast of Sunrise Peak, began forming in the Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to Mount Saint Helens' proximity to Sunrise Peak, volcanic ash is common in the area. Sunrise Peak is composed of Pliocene-Miocene andesitic magma that intruded up into older volcanic rocks more than five million years ago and is now surrounded by a forest of old-growth Douglas fir and mountain hemlock. Climate Sunrise Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.

A level n-structure is given by a fixed basis of : H_1(X_\\\\Omega, \\\\mathbb{Z}/n) \\\\cong \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\cdot L/L \\\\cong n\\\\text{-torsion of } X_\\\\Omega where L is the lattice \\\\Omega\\\\mathbb{Z}^g + \\\\mathbb{Z}^g \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{C}^{2g}.

The series is set in London and stars Coel as Arabella, a young woman who seeks to rebuild her life after being raped. The series premiered on 8 June 2020 on BBC One and on 7 June 2020 on HBO.  Plot  Arabella (Michaela Coel) is a Twitter-star-turned-novelist who found fame with her debut book Chronicles of a Fed-Up Millennial and is publicly celebrated as a Millennial icon. Whilst struggling to meet a deadline for her second book, she takes a break from work to meet up with friends on a night out in London. The following morning, she struggles to remember what happened to her, but recalls the events of the night with the help of her friends Terry (Weruche Opia) and Kwame (Paapa Essiedu).

The first episode had already premiered in advance on 7 June 2020 on HBO in the United States.  Production  Coel stated in a lecture at the 2018 Edinburgh Festival Fringe that she had been sexually assaulted while writing Chewing Gum, and that the experience provided inspiration for the series. Originally titled January 22nd, the series is produced by Coel's production company, FALKNA Productions. It is executive produced by Coel, Phil Clarke, Roberto Troni, and Jo McClellan for BBC One. Coel is also co-director and writer for I May Destroy You. She turned down a $1 million (¬£800,000) offer from Netflix for the show because the deal would have taken full rights ownership away from the creator.  Critical response  The show holds an average score of 86 out of 100 based on reviews from 25 critics on review aggregator Metacritic, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". On Rotten Tomatoes, 97% of 72 reviews are positive, with an average score of 8.55/10. The website's critical consensus is, \\"I May Destroy You is at once brave and delicate, untangling the trauma of sexual assault with dark humor and moments of deep discomfort all held together on the strength of Michaela Coel's undeniable talent.\\" Writing for The New York Times, critic Mike Hale called the series \\"touching and quietly hilarious.\\" He praised Coel and the show's willingness to push boundaries. In her review for Time, critic Judy Berman noted the show's unique and complex telling of a story centered around sexual assault after the Me Too movement.

The Grand Fauve de Bretagne were large rough-coated hounds, their coats were short, dense and harsh, and they were a uniform pale golden-brown in colour. Grand Fauve de Bretagnes were renowned for their unruly natures, being very difficult to control; their temperament suited them for hunting dangerous game like wolf and wild boar, but due to their unruliness they were also known to kill sheep and goats against their huntsman's wishes. The Fauve de Bretagne hounds were known in France from the 16th century, in 1520 Francis I of France was presented with a hound \\"Miraud\\" by the Breton Admiral Claude d'Annebault; Francis subsequently kept a pack. In 1570, Charles IX of France in his La Chasse Royale listed the Fauve de Bretagne as one of the principal breeds of French hounds. With the extirpation of wolves from much of France in the mid-19th century these hounds became rare; by 1873 it was recorded that purebred examples were hard to find and it was believed only three packs retained the bloodlines; in subsequent decades the breed became extinct.

She is known for collecting a small number of fern specimens in New Zealand, which were used by Joseph Dalton Hooker in his Handbook of the New Zealand Flora. Born in Stepney in London,1871 Wales Census for Emma Jones: Anglesey, Llanddeusant ‚Äì Ancestry.com Emma Buchanan was the eldest daughter of Emma and Andrew Buchanan. The Buchanan family emigrated to New Zealand on the Dinapore in 1857. Also on board were a widower, Humphrey Stanley Herbert Jones (1817‚Äì1902), and his sister Elizabeth Stack. Four months after arriving in Auckland she married Jones, the commissary general of the British forces in New Zealand. They were married by Bishop George Selwyn at St Stephen's Chapel in Auckland, on 1 December 1857. In the same ceremony, Jones's sister Edith Buchanan married Alexander Clerk, Humphrey Jones's deputy in the commissariat. Eliza Stack's journal records that almost as soon as they had arrived in New Zealand, a Dr Prendergast helped Jones to identify ferns she collected from caves at Three Kings. Stack also recounts several trips taken with Humphrey and Emma Jones around New Zealand, including collecting trips for ferns and mosses for Stack's and Jones's collections. The Joneses built the house Clovernook in Auckland, but eventually returned to England. They did not have any children. It is not known when Emma Jones died.

Botanical contributions  Jones was the author of the Handbook to the Ferns of New Zealand, chiefly compiled from Dr Hooker's \\"Flora Novae Zelandiae\\", Sir Wm. J. Hooker's \\"Species Filicum\\", etc. The 32 page pamphlet was sold for two shillings and six pence to raise funds for expenses incurred in the erection of St. Mary's Church, Parnell, Auckland. The handbook was printed in 1861, and Eric Godley regarded it as the first Flora printed in New Zealand, 'holding the fort' until the printing of Hooker's Handbook of the New Zealand Flora appeared in 1864. Godley notes that although much of the material in the handbook was borrowed from Hooker, the sections which are Jones's own show her to be \\"no mean botanist\\". Hooker‚Äôs Handbook of the New Zealand Flora (1864) references the following Jones' collections: Todea africana at Hokianga; Adiantum formosum at Kaipara and Whangarei; Loxsoma cunninghamii at Waitemata; Gymnogramme leptophylla on the summit of Mount Wellington; Hypolepis distans at Manakau Heads; Loxsoma cunninghamii at Coromandel; Nephrodium molle at Rotomahana; Aspidium cystostegia, Cystopteris fragilis, Lomaria elongata, Lomaria vulcanica and Marattia salicina in the Mt Egmont Range; Hymenophyllum aeruginosum at Wellington; Lomaria vulcanica at Nelson.

Simpson murder case was announced and Simpson was acquitted on both counts of murder. The public reaction to the verdict remains a popular subject because initial polling showed that most blacks (70%) agreed with the verdict while most whites (75%) did not. The media called this the \\"racial gap\\" In 2016, FiveThirtyEight reported that the gap has narrowed with most African Americans now believing Simpson was guilty. The narrowing racial gap is primarily attributed to several factors: Daniel Petrocelli disproving all of the blood planting claims at the civil trial, Defense witness Dr. Henry Lee published a study that effectively disproved the contamination claim presented at trial, and the fading of Simpson's celebrity status since the trial.  Criticism of the Jury  Jurors Amanda Cooley, Carrie Bess and Marsha Rubin-Jackson published Madame Foreman: A Rush to Judgement? They describe why they felt there was reasonable doubt despite personally believing Simpson might be guilty. Because it was published only a few months after the verdict and before the other attorneys and detectives published their books, it is considered an accurate picture of what the jury believed when they acquitted Simpson. Critics panned the book and it became a source of embarrassment for the authors as critics claim it proves many of their claims about the jury. = Misunderstanding of DNA evidence = Toobin, Rantala, and Buligosi all claim the jurors misunderstood the DNA evidence in the case. Rantala based this on the claims they made in Madame Foreman. Bess wrote she thought the blood at the crime scene belonged to Simpson's children while Cooley wrote she thought the blood actually belonged to criminalist Andrea Mazzola. In Outrage, Bugliosi opined they misunderstood the defenses argument because \\"contamination cannot change someone's DNA into someone else's\\" which is what the jurors apparently believed..https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reaction_to_the_verdict_in_the_O._J._Simpson_criminal_trial&action;=edit&section;=24#> Toobin wrote they misunderstood the facts of the case regarding the DNA evidence.https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Run_of_His_Life/TS_ZCwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv;=1&bsq;=There%20was%20only%20one%20reference%20to%20DNA%20tests Jackson wrote she thought Simpson's blood at the crime scene was there before the murders happened. Bess also admitted to not knowing that Simpson's blood was on the glove found at his home that Fuhrman allegedly planted. Cooley admitted to discarding blood evidence without any justification at all. The jurors stopped claiming there was reasonable doubt about the DNA evidence after learning that both of the forensic DNA experts for the defense, Dr. Henry Lee and Dr. Edward Blake, had rejected the contamination claim that Scheck and Neufeld argued. Dr. Blake also admitted that was the reason why he was dropped from the witness list. Cochran mentioned Blake in opening statements but never produced him as a witness and in closing arguments Clark had mentioned Blakes absence as proof the results were reliable. = Dismissal of domestic violence being racially motivated = Clark wrote that she believed the jury dismissed Simpson's abuse of Nicole for racial reasons. She wrote that \\"race trumped gender\\" and they identified with the abuser rather than the victim due to race. The jurors called the domestic violence argument a \\"waste of time\\" and Juror Brenda Moran said \\"this is a murder trial, not a domestic violence trial\\". They claim they discarded it because there were no new incidents of abuse since 1989. A 911 call of an incident eight months before Brown's death was presented at trial and again during summation. The jurors also claimed that they did not believe Brown thought her life was seriously in danger but one of the documents they saw at trial was a Will stating her wishes in the event of her death. Shapiro, Dershowitz, Uelman also agreed with Clark. Dershowitz stated: \\"[the jurors] were black first, women second\\". Uelman stated their research suggested that black women typically are opposed to interracial marriage and would be hostile to Brown. In 2016, regarding Nicole, Carrie Bess said, \\"I lose respect for any woman who takes an ass-whoopin' when she don't have to. Don't stay under the water if it's over your head, you'll drown,\\" in her own way expressing her apathy towards Nicole for apparently \\"allowing\\" Simpson to abuse her. Detective Mark Fuhrman was also accused of opposing interracial couples, but he was labeled a racist for doing so. Shapiro wrote that the jury consultants stated that \\"black women often will be defensive and even protective of black men who are accused of such behavior by white women.\\" Dismissed juror Jeanette Harris was cited as an example of this: She concealed her domestic abuse so she could be on the jury, then denied it so she could stay on the jury and then minimized it after being dismissed in order to protect Simpson, even after his domestic abuse had been proven. Darnel Hunt opines that the worst part of the Simpson Case was the indifference by contemporary African Americans to the domestic violence. The revelation of the abuse had turned public opinion against Simpson but his support among African Americans remained relatively unchanged. The tension over Interracial marriage in the United States stems from it once being criminalized. These laws were created by the white majority and were indisputably motivated by Racism. All of the jurors were raised at a time when those laws were still in place in some parts of the country before finally being ruled unconstitutional in Loving v. Virginia in 1967. The jurors stopped claiming the abuse was irrelevant after Dr. Lenore E. Walker revealed that she was dropped from the witness list by the defense because her research concluded that over 80% of murdered spouses who are victims of abuse are killed by their abusers. Rubin-Jackson later apologized to Denise Brown, who became an advocate for survivors of domestic violence, for calling it a waste of time. The strong public reaction to Brown's letters and statements that were later ruled inadmissible as hearsay spurred passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, which Clark and Douglas referred to as the \\"O.J. rule\\". The act was a direct response to the Simpson case and included provisions that required mandatory arrests in domestic violence situations, allowed prosecution of abusers even if the victim doesn't testify, and provided hearsay exceptions in domestic violence situations so statements made by the victim are admissible even if they are unavailable for cross- examination. After the trial, researchers reported increased reporting, arrests, and harsher sentences for those convicted of domestic violence. = Bias against the prosecution = Critics claim the jury was biased against the prosecution and the police and made absurd arguments for discarding evidence. Alan Dershowitz stated the jury \\"wanted to let Simpson go\\" and cited their dismissal of Alan Parks testimony for \\"trivial\\" reasons as evidence of this. Bess said she dismissed the significant testimony of Alan Park because he didn't know how many cars were parked in Simpson's driveway, which had nothing to do with his testimony. Bess also said she discarded the evidence of Simpson's blood at the crime scene because she believed Vannatter could have planted it there when he returned to Simpson's home that evening even though the crime scene wasn't even there. Shelia Woods discarded all of the DNA evidence at the crime because she incorrectly thought all of it was found on the back gate and she found that suspicious. Cooley admitted to discarding blood evidence without any justification at all. In Ezra Edelman's 2016 documentary O.J.: Made in America, Carrie Bess said she believed \\"90% of the jury\\" actually decided to acquit Simpson as payback for the Rodney King incident, not because they believed in his innocence, and when asked if she believed the decision was correct, she merely shrugged indifferently. Following the acquittal, Bill Hodgman claimed that in conversation with the deputy sheriff who had released the jurors, the sheriff had witnessed reunions and celebrations between the jurors and their families and heard numerous times that the acquittal was indeed revenge for Rodney King. Juror Yolanda Crawford, however, denied that claim. She said the verdict was due to the prosecution's mistakes, such as presenting Fuhrman as a witness and having Simpson don the gloves. In an interview with Meredith Vieira, she said the verdict may have been different had they seen the photos of Simpson wearing the Bruno Magli shoes that he denied owning but in the same interview, Kim Goldman disputed Crawford's claim, arguing that the only Physical evidence linking Simpson to the crime was DNA evidence and that didn't change from the criminal trial. All the bloody shoeprints at the crime scene were made by those shoes. All of the jurors expressed a belief that fraud had taken place but during the subsequent civil trial Daniel M. Petrocelli had deductively disproven all of the blood planting conspiracy claims made at the criminal trial by Scheck. Petrocelli noted that the evidence used to disprove those claims was available at the criminal trial which lead to further criticism that the jury discarded evidence and the verdict was a racially motivated Jury nullification. The only fraud claim that could not be deductively disproven was Fuhrman planting the glove at Simpson's home but there was no physical or eyewitness evidence to support this. Jeffrey Toobin wrote that the defense was planning on making that claim months before the trial began because that was the only explanation for why that glove was found at Simpson's home. The only two arguments made to support that claim were Simpson struggled to put on the gloves and the Fuhrman tapes which suggested he was capable of such conduct. The investigation into the Fuhrman tapes found no evidence of wrongdoing and instead found evidence that he was playacting for the Hollywood screenwriter like he later claimed and Shapiro admitted that Simpson was acting (as the prosecution claimed) when he appeared to struggle to put on the gloves. Vincent Bugliosi wrote that the conspiracy allegations were designed to explain incriminating evidence that the defense couldn't refute. Simpson's blood on the Bundy back gate, Brown's blood on the sock, the bloody footprint in Simpson's Bronco and the location of one of the bloody gloves (Simpson's home) couldn't be explained by either contamination or incompetence so the defense made conspiracy claims of fraud instead. When the prosecution began offering evidence refuting the contamination claim and demonstrating the irrelevance of the mistakes made, the conspiracy allegation expanded to claim that virtually all of the evidence was planted. Darnel Hunt wrote that African American distrust of the police is not unfounded but the claim of a wide- ranging police conspiracy was entirely implausible. Hunt said the jury accepted every fraud claim the defense made without question and that is what later led to their criticism after those claims were refuted. Years later, some of the jurors are still reiterating those claims: In 2016 juror Shelia Woods stated she still thinks that Simpson's blood on the back gate at Bundy was planted by the police despite the blood being photographed there prior to Simpson's blood being drawn from his arm. Prosecutor William Hodgman was supposed to be Clark's co-counsel but was replaced with Darden after he became hospitalized. During a press conference, Johnnie Cochran claimed that the prosecution were merely using Darden as a black man to boost their case, which caused the jury to consider Darden a token black assigned to the case. Mark Fuhrman wrote feeling the same way about Darden. Jeffrey Toobin claimed that everything Cochran was saying about Darden was basically \\"Uncle Tom\\", and expressed his disgust at Cochran's behavior. = Deliberation time = Many have observed that the jury's deliberation time, three hours, was unduly short. In O.J.: Made in America, Jeffrey Toobin stated that in general, every week of trial requires one day of deliberation. The history of domestic violence, Simpson's legal history of stalking Nicole and making death threats towards her, Nicole filing a safety deposit box of photographs of past beatings and a will, her assertion that Simpson would kill her and go unpunished, the overwhelming amount of physical evidence linking Simpson to the crime and Simpson's lack of a sufficient alibi have led many to believe that the jury's \\"not guilty\\" verdict was actually a racially-motivated Jury nullification. In the documentary, Ezra Edelman asked both Carrie Bess and Yolanda Crawford how they managed to reach such a verdict in three hours. While Crawford stated that she had thought about all the evidence each night of the trial and reached her conclusion over time, Bess shrugged and smugly told Edelman, \\"We had to go home\\" and that the verdict was payback for the Rodney King beating, not because they believed Simpson was innocent of the murders. Prosecutor Bill Hodgman said that he had a \\"feeling of numbness\\" after hearing the verdict, while Marcia Clark claimed that part of her had expected the \\"not guilty\\" verdict from the black jury after such a short time. = Reversal of opinion by some jurors and defense attorneys = Several jurors have reversed their previous opinions of Simpson's innocence. In 2016, Carrie Bess admitted that while she still believes that acquitting Simpson was the correct decision in the atmosphere of the 1990s, she regrets the not guilty verdict following Simpson's arrest in Las Vegas, and labelled Simpson as \\"stupid\\" for getting himself into more trouble. Juror number nine, Lionel Cryer, a former member of the Black Panther Party who notably gave Simpson a black power raised fist after the verdict, said that in retrospect, he would render a guilty verdict. Juror Ansie Aschenbach, who initially voted guilty before changing her vote, stated she regrets the decision and believes Simpson is guilty because he is not looking for the \\"real killer\\" like he promised he would. As of 2020, Carrie Bess remains the only author of Madame Foreman who has not apologized to either the Browns or Goldmans for the verdict or the book and who continues to assert that acquitting Simpson as payback for Rodney King was not an incorrect decision. In O.J.: Made in America, film director Peter Hyams, who had worked with Simpson in Capricorn One, claimed that he had discussed the possibility of Simpson's guilt with Dershowitz, who had admitted that in order for Mark Fuhrman to successfully frame Simpson, he would have to know that Simpson had no alibi whatsoever and that he was not risking his own job or life as well, since Fuhrman would have been facing the death penalty himself if he had attempted to frame Simpson for a double homicide, and went on to admit that he believed Simpson was the killer. Bailey continued to assert that Fuhrman planted the glove to frame Simpson, while Scheck refused to give a definitive answer as to whether or not he truly believed all the evidence against Simpson had been planted as he had claimed at the trial.  Criticism of the prosecution  Prosecutor Hank Goldberg published The Prosecution Responds: An O.J. Simpson Trial Prosecutor Reveals what Really Happened (1999) and wrote that the verdict was the result of a \\"perfect storm\\" of mistakes by investigators, prosecutors, and the court, all taking place in the aftermath of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Former Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi published Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O. J. Simpson Got Away with Murder. Bugliosi primarily attributes the verdict to poor decisions by the prosecutors but added that poor stewardship by Judge Lance Ito, and the change of venue that he claims resulted in a jury that was hostile to the prosecution, contributed as well. = Inaccurate estimate of Simpsons blood draw = According to Goldberg, Hodgman, Darden and Marcia Clark, the principal mistake made in the case was during the preliminary phase when Thano Peratis incorrectly estimated how much blood he drew from Simpson. He estimated initially that he withdrew 8mL's from Simpson but the records only show that 6.5 mL's was accounted for and the defense alleged that 1.5mL's of Simpson's blood was missing. That mistake threw the prosecution on the defensive as Scheck claimed it was missing due to fraud. Peratis was scheduled to testify again early in the trial to clarify but he became hospitalized and the jury never heard him correct his estimate until the rebuttal stage of the trial, after Scheck had already made all of his blood planting claims. = The glove demonstration = It was prosecutor Christopher Darden who asked to have Simpson try on the gloves at trial. In O.J.: Made in America, Marcia Clark claimed that she had implored Darden not to have Simpson try the gloves on and they had fought many times about it. Though Darden accepted, Bailey fooled him into having Simpson try them on, stating that if he didn't, the defense would. The gloves not fitting was national news because of the perceived impact it had on the jurors and also universally recognized as a prosecutorial blunder. Bugliosi was very critical of Darden and wrote that asking Simpson to don the gloves was akin to asking Simpson if he was guilty and expecting him to reply affirmatively. Juror Brenda Moran said she acquitted Simpson because the gloves didn't fit but juror Lionel Cryer said the glove demonstration was pointless because it was obvious they had changed from their original condition because Darden produced a new pair of the same type gloves and they fit Simpson just fine. = Failure to introduce incriminating evidence = Prosecutor William Hodgman, prior to being replaced as Clarks co-counsel, decided not to introduce the evidence of the Bronco chase, the suicide note, the items found inside the Bronco and the video of Simpson's police interview. Clark agreed and chose not to present it after Hodgman was replaced. Bugliosi was very critical of Clarks decision because that evidence was very incriminating - Simpson admitted to cutting his finger on the police interview the same day as the murders, he apologized to the family of Ron Goldman for what could only be his murder because they had never even met, he took his passport with him when he fled implying he intended to leave the country and brought a disguise kit so he wouldn't be recognized. Clark agreed with Bugliosi that the evidence was incriminating yet defended her decision and noted the public was aware that his actions implied guilt yet thousands of people were supporting his attempt to flee prosecution and were sympathetic to his feelings of guilt. Jeffrey Toobin added that the jury was already aware of the Bronco chase, the suicide note and the items found in the Bronco because they had watched it on TV and decided to discard it nonetheless. = Dropping the domestic violence portion of the case = Prosecutor Marcia Clark was the one who decided to drop the domestic violence portion of the case halfway through presenting it. Darden wrote that the domestic violence was the motive for the murders. Vincent Bugliosi wrote he would have gone into more detail about it and noted that the abuse had turned public opinion against Simpson and opined that it would have also turned the jury against him as well if Clark and Darden had presented it better. Daniel M. Petrocelli credited the difference in the outcome in civil trial to the jury being receptive to the argument that domestic abuse is a prelude to murder. Darden wrote that the presentation of that part of the case was hampered by Judge Ito ruling the letters and statements by Nicole inadmissible as Hearsay. Witness accounts were admissible but Ito again delayed the prosecution from calling them until after all the forensic evidence had been presented. By then, Darden wrote, the jury was exhausted and appeared disinterested in hearing anymore about the abuse. Clark claimed she dropped it because she felt the DNA evidence in the case was insurmountable but the media speculated it was due to the comments by dismissed juror Jeanette Harris and Darden confirmed that to be true. Harris was a victim of domestic violence but failed to disclose it and was dismissed as a result. But afterwards, she gave an interview and called Simpson's abuse of Brown \\"a whole lot of nothing\\" and said other jurors on the panel felt the same way. In Evidence Dismissed and Murder in Brentwood, Detectives Lange, Vannatter and Fuhrman all wrote that they considered the history of domestic violence to be a weak motive for murder as well. = Changing the venue = In Outrage, Buligosi criticized the prosecution for holding the trial in downtown Los Angeles rather than Santa Monica where the murders took place. Alan Dershowitz stated the prosecution did this intentionally but Toobin wrote that changing the venue is the domain of the courts, not the district attorney, and the trial \\"could never have been held anywhere except the criminal courts building in downtown Los Angeles\\" because that was the only area at the time that could accommodate it. Darden wrote in In Contempt that it was hypocritical to criticize the defense for allegedly trying to seat black jurors while also criticizing the prosecution for not wanting to hold the trial in Santa Monica so there would be fewer black jurors. During the jury selection process, both the defense and the prosecution were accused of intentionally trying to seat or exclude black jurors respectively which was illegal because California courts barred peremptory challenges to jurors based on race in People v. Wheeler.476 U.S. 79 (1986)22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P. 2d 748 (1978)  Criticism of the defense  alt= = Race= In July, polling suggested that 90% of African Americans did not believe that race was a factor in the murders of Brown and Goldman. The controversy of the June 27 Time Magazine cover, which had a darkened mugshot of Simpson, seemed to have generated sympathy for Simpson due to allegations of racism, even though he had been accused of a double murder. Shapiro admitted the defense played the \\"race card from the bottom of the deck\\". Dershowitz, who later criticized Cochran for introducing race into the trial, later wrote in Reasonable Doubts: The Criminal Justice System and the O.J. Simpson Case that \\"we played the only card we could\\". In O.J.: Made in America, Jeffrey Toobin agreed with Darden's initial request of banning racial issues from the trial because they were irrelevant and \\"would blind the jury...and cause extreme prejudice to the prosecutions case\\" and Darden stated. Toobin opines that while Cochran's closing statement is best known for his phrase, \\"If it doesn't fit, you must acquit\\", the question that Cochran was truly putting to the jury was \\"Whose side are you on?\\" Dismissed juror Jeanette Harris confirmed that the jury was dividing themselves along racial lines as a result of race being introduced into the trial. Cochran's statements during his summation also suggest this as well: \\"If you grew up in this country, then you know there are Fuhrman's out there\\" was a naked appeal to racial solidarity to the black jurors according to Toobin and his statement \\"acquit Simpson and send the police a message\\" was an appeal for a Jury nullification for the murders according to Alan Dershowitz. After the verdict was read, juror Lionel Cryer gave Simpson a Raised fist black power salute. Robert Shapiro wrote in The Search for Justice: A Defense Attorney's Brief on the O.J. Simpson Case that Cochran introducing race into the trial is the primary factor that drove the dream team apart: \\"Race is not the issue...A defense built on race will never help us.\\" Shapiro wrote that Cochran used race to argue for a Jury nullification in his summations, Bailey used it to argue that Fuhrman planted the glove, Scheck used it to argue his blood planting claims, and Dershowitz used it to support his police conspiracy allegation. Regarding Bailey, Scheck and Dershowitz's conspiracy claims, Shapiro wrote he doesn't believe that Simpson was framed by the police. After his closing argument, Cochran received numerous death threats, and hired bodyguards from Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, which particularly angered Shapiro, as Farrakhan was famous for his black supremacist and anti-Semitic views. After the verdict, Shapiro stated in an interview that he would never again work with Cochran. Sociology professor Harry Edwards stated that \\"[Simpson's] sentiments were, 'I'm not black, I'm O.J.'\\" regarding his apathy towards racial issues. Vincent Bugliosi criticized the prosecution in Outrage for not using aspects of Simpsons personal life to refute the defenses claim that he was a hero of the black community - he left his black wife for a white women, had affairs only with white women, had two biracial children, moved into a white neighborhood and after divorcing had a white girlfriend. The defense was aware of all of this and made attempts to conceal it. Robert Kardashian admitted during an interview with Barbara Walters that, prior to the jurors visiting Simpson's home, the defense had staged his home and switched out his photos of white women for black women and children, including switching a picture of a nude Paula Barbieri (Simpson's girlfriend at the time, who was white) for a Norman Rockwell painting from Cochran's office. = Unethical behavior = Jurors Cooley, Bess and Rubin- Jackson wrote in A Rush to Judgement? that Barry Scheck was the most persuasive attorney at the trial. Vincent Bugliosi, Darnel M. Hunt, Daniel M. Petrocelli, and defense witness Dr. Henry Lee all wrote that Scheck engaged in palpable fraud in trying to convince the jury there was reasonable doubt about the physical evidence. Hunt wrote in O. J. Simpson Facts and Fictions: News Rituals in the Construction of Reality that Scheck \\"floated ridiculous conspiracy theories to the jury\\". Jeffrey Toobin wrote in The Run of His Life: The People v. O.J. Simpson that \\"the most remarkable thing was that Scheck actually accomplished this goal...Schecks arguments presupposed a conspiracy so immense within the LAPD that, analyzed objectively, it seemed a practical impossibility but Scheck made his theories real for the jury and for that reason he was primarily responsible for that verdict.\\" In Triumph of Justice: Closing the Book on the O.J. Simpson Saga, Petrocelli explains how he disproved all of Scheck's blood planting claims. Scheck implied that Vannatter could have planted Simpson's blood at the crime scene when he returned later that evening to Simpson's home to deliver his blood reference vial to Dennis Fung but the crime scene is actually at Nicole Brown's home. Scheck then suggested that another police officer could have \\"sprinkled Simpson's blood at the crime scene\\" but the prosecution demonstrated that the blood was photographed being there prior to Simpsons blood being drawn by the nurse. Scheck then implied that Vannatter could have planted the victims blood in the Bronco when he returned to Simpson's home but the Bronco had been impounded prior to his arrival and wasn't even there. Scheck then suggested that the victims blood in the Bronco could be the result of contamination in the LAPD crime lab but defense witness Dr. Lee wrote in Blood Evidence: How Dna Is Revolutionizing the Way We Solve Crimes the prosecution disproved that claim when the second collection from the Bronco returned the same matches as the first collection, proving they weren't contaminates. Scheck then produced two witnesses who claimed there was no blood in the impounded Bronco implying the blood was planted by the police afterwards but the prosecution produced photographs of the blood in the impounded Bronco which disproved that fraud claim as well. In 2014, Scheck acknowledged that public perception of defense attorneys changed as a result of his blood planting claims at the trial. Darden wrote in In Contempt that nearly all of Scheck's blood planting claims were originally made by Stephen Singular in his book proposal for Legacy of Deception: An Investigation of Mark Fuhrman and Racism in the L.A.P.D. The key difference is that he claimed that Fuhrman, not Vannatter, planted all of the blood evidence. Singular cited an unnamed source in the LAPD but both Johnnie Cochran and Carl Douglas dismissed Singulars claims because Fuhrman never had access to Simpson's reference vial. Reporters Philip Bosco and Tracie Savage both reported that another unnamed source in the LAPD had told them the match of Nicole Brown's blood on the socks in September and allegedly before the test was even done. The defense argued this meant the blood was planted because the source already new what the result would be and wanted Savage testify to that. Like Singular, neither reporter revealed who the source was and Ito ruled it was irrelevant for them to do so because the claim was \\"bogus\\": the test was actually done on August 4, a month before not after, the source revealed the match. Savage has since then disowned that claim entirely. Other members of the dream team produced witnesses that gave misleading testimony. Cochran produced LAPD videographer Willie Ford who showed a video of Simpson's bedroom without the socks present which Cochran implied proves they were planted but Ford admitted the video was made after the Socks had already been collected. Blood spatter expert Herbert MacDonell stated that the only way the stains observed on the socks could be made was if the blood was planted on the sock after it had been taken off but admitted that the same pattern can be produced if Simpson simply touched the socks after removing them.  Witness perjury  Sylvia Guerra, a housekeeper for Simpsons neighbor claimed that her and another housekeeping, Rosa Lopez, were both offered $5,000 to lie and say they saw Simpson's Bronco parked in front of his house the night of the murders. The tow truck driver John Meraz and William Blasini Jr both testified that there was no blood in the impounded Bronco despite photographs of the blood that clearly demonstrate they were lying. Unreliable Expert Testimony Simpson's Dream Team retained many high- profile experts. Many of them were initially approached by the prosecution but decided to represent Simpson instead because of the larger retainers. The conventional wisdom at the time is that experts can only truthfully represent one side of a case because it is presumed that their interpretation of the facts would be the same regardless of who retains them. The Simpson case challenged that belief because experts in this case gave testimony that favored Simpson but contradicted many of their claims they had made in previous cases. In the aftermath of the verdict, many of the experts began walking back their claims. = Dr. Lenore Walker = The defense retained renowned advocate for victims of domestic abuse, Dr. Lenore E. Walker. Cochran said she would testify that Simpson doesn't fit the profile of an abuser that would murder his spouse but she was dropped from the witness list for \\"tactical reasons\\" after her report on the case concluded that \\"80.3% of murdered spouses who were also victims of abuse were in fact killed by their current or ex-husband.\\" Dr. Walker's colleagues were appalled by her decision to defend Simpson and accused her of betraying her advocacy for a $250,000 retainer by knowingly giving testimony that contradicted her own research as her report demonstrated. The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence wrote of Dr. Walker's assessment of Simpson \\"[it] is absolutely the opposite of the assessment of most battered women‚Äôs advocates in this country.‚Äù During the civil trial, Dr. Walker dropped Simpson as a client and testified against him instead for the Goldmans. = Michael Baden = Dr. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist, testified that the murders happened closer to 11:00pm, which is when Simpson has an alibi and stated that Brown was still conscious, standing, and took a step after her throat was cut and that Goldman was standing and fighting his assailant for ten minutes with a lacerated jugular vein. Daniel M. Petrocelli wrote in Triumph of Justice: Closing the Book on the Simpson Saga that Baden's claims were nonsensical and he tried to avoid making them again at the civil trial. The claim that Brown was standing and conscious after her throat was slashed was untenable because the injury severed her cervical spinal cord which would have paralyzed her from the neck down. His claim of Goldman's ten minute struggle was also untenable as well because it only takes five minutes for someone to completely exsanguinate from such an injury. Baden admitted his claim of Goldman's long struggle was inaccurate at the civil trial and would later say that testifying for Simpson was a mistake because he was consistently being discredited for the claims that he made at the trial that he later admitted were not true. Vincent Bugliosi wrote in Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O. J. Simpson Got Away with Murder that Baden's claims were \\"silly\\" and claimed that he knowingly gave false testimony in order to collect a $100,000 retainer because the week before he testified, Dr. Gerdes admitted that Goldman's blood was in Simpson's Bronco despite Goldman never having an opportunity within his lifetime to be in the Bronco. Christopher Darden opined in In Contempt that prosecutor Brian Kelberg irritated Baden when he implied that he was being \\"rented out\\" by Simpson and he responded by making those absurd claims to get back at him. = Fredrich Rieders = In Blood Evidence: How DNA is revolutionizing the way we solve crimes, Dr. Lee writes that Dr. Fredric Rieders was initially approached by the prosecution to interpret the results from the EDTA testing but he chose to represent Simpson instead. His decision ended up being a mistake because the defense ultimately withheld key details that would have resulted in him not testifying. His testimony that the presence of EDTA suggested the blood was planted from the reference vials gave the appearance of scientific credence to the defenses fraud claims. However, the defense neglected to mention to Rieders that one of those blood drops had been photographed being there prior to the reference vial existing, proving it couldn't have come from there. Furthermore, Detective Vannatter, who was accused of planting the other blood drop on the sock never went inside the evidence van where the socks were stored which proves he didn't plant that blood either. FBI special agent Roger Martz later demonstrated that the results were actually false positives from having tested the reference vials first before the evidence samples. Thomas Lambert accused Rieders of knowingly giving false testimony at the criminal trial in exchange for a $46,000 retainer because there was clear evidence then the results were not reliable: the blood on the back tested positive for the presence of EDTA despite it being impossible to have come from the reference vial, the substrate control for that blood drop tested positive for EDTA despite having no blood on it at all, the results for the two evidence samples and Agent Martz's unpreserved blood were exactly the same and no where near the levels seen in the reference vials and Dr. Rieders himself said that it was impossible for Agent Martz to have that much EDTA in his unpreserved blood. In Triumph of Justice, Petrocelli wrote that Dr. Robbin Cotton had conclusively proven at the civil trial that it was impossible for the blood on the socks to have come from Brown's reference vial by showing that the blood in the reference vial is more degraded than the blood on the sock, which is impossible if that was its source. Afterwards, Rieders conceded \\"this might not be blood from a purple top test tube\\". In Outrage, Bugliosi opined if the tests had been done correctly, they would have conclusively disproven the blood planting claims. In Run of his Life, Toobin wrote that the prosecution did prove that no EDTA was present but the testimony was \\"highly technical\\". Dr. Lee in Blood Evidence wrote that the testimony of Dr. Rieders and Agent Martz was almost incomprehensible and opines that the jury believed Rieders over Martz because he was a renowned scholar even though Martz had evidence and literature to backup his conclusions. = Henry Lee = Bugliosi in Outrage wrote that Dr. Lee knowingly gave misleading testimony and allowed Scheck to imply he supported the fraud claims. Lee's \\"somethings wrong\\" claim implying the police tampered with one of the blood swatches at the crime scene was absurd because that blood belonged to Nicole Brown and its ridiculous for anyone to plant her blood at the crime scene when her body was already there. Furthermore, Bugliosi wrote that Dr. Lee was aware that Scheck was arguing that Dennis Fung had tampered with the swatches and seriously doubts that the Chinese born scientist really believed that the Chinese-American criminalist would participate in a racially motivated conspiracy to frame Simpson. In Triumph of Justice, Petrocelli wrote that Dr. Henry Lee clarified his statements and said \\"he never meant to imply that the police tampered with evidence.\\" Regarding the wet transfer stain, the prosecution said the wet stain was simply due to one of the swatches still being wet and Lee admitted \\"I offered that same explanation since day one\\". = John Gerdes = According to Dr. Henry Lee in Blood Evidence: How DNA is revolutionizing the way we solve crimes, Dr. Gerdes \\"had no experience whatsoever in forensic DNA matching\\" and made more factually inaccurate claims than any other witness at the criminal trial. Darden wrote in In Contempt that all of Gerdes claims were misleading conjecture. None of the defense attorneys in their books about the trial - Shapiro, Dershowitz, Cochran, or Uelman - mention Gerdes even though the jurors in A Rush to Judgement? specifically cite him as the one who raised what they believed to be reasonable doubt about the DNA evidence. In Outrage, Bugliosi opines the reason why is because \\"contamination cannot change someone's DNA into someone else's\\" which is what the jurors believed to be true Howard Coleman, president of GeneLex, a Seattle-based forensic DNA laboratory called the contamination claim \\"smoke and mirrors\\" and said \\"everything we get in the lab is contaminated to some degree. What contamination and degradation will lead you to is an inconclusive result. It doesn't lead you to a false positive.\\" Dr. Lee explains in Blood Evidence why he rejected Gerdes claims. Gerdes claimed that contamination could happen from repeated use of the reagents used for Amplification but neglected to mention that all the reagents tested negative for contamination. Petrocelli wrote in Triumph of Justice that Gerdes lied when he said that Collin Yamauchi spilled Simpson's blood in the lab. Gerdes claimed that the results from the second Bronco collection were unreliable because the car had been burglarized but admitted the DNA matches are the same before and afterwards, disproving that claim. Rantala wrote that Gerdes most flagrant deception came when he implied that the evidence locker was in the PCR amplification room when he said that Yamauchi took the PCR extraction product back to \\"the same location\\". Rantala wrote that Gerdes said that so his contamination claim would be plausible but was being openly dishonest because he toured the lab and knew that wasn't true. Lee wrote in Blood Evidence that \\"Gerdes conceded the PCR extraction product was not returned to the specific area near the extraction room or evidence-handling area but was taken to a completely separate area located a comfortable distance away making a contamination scenario highly improbable\\". Pundits were skeptical of Gerdes claims too because he was not the defense's first choice: renowned forensic DNA expert, Dr. Edward Blake, was supposed to be making the case for contamination but was dropped from the witness list after rejecting it. They also noted that Gerdes claimed it was impossible to distinguish blood from the reference vials from blood from the body despite Dr. Rieders demonstrating just that the week prior using EDTA. That false claim notwithstanding, his testimony wasn't reliable they said because he was clearly pandering to the defense: all of his contamination occurred through random carelessness in the lab yet the only three matches he said were valid were the same three the defense claimed were planted while the remaining 58 matches were all false positives despite admitting that has never happened before. The substrate controls that are used to determine if contamination like he was suggesting occurred were also coincidentally all false negatives. So Gerdes was claiming that the contamination only got on the evidence items despite they and the substrate controls all being handled interchangeably at the same time. Clinical molecular geneticist Dr. Brad Popovich called Gerdes claims \\"ridiculous\\". Thomas Lambert was given high marks for his cross- examination of Gerdes forcing him to admit \\"there's no direct evidence of contamination in any of the test results that I looked at in this case.\\" Prosecutor and DNA expert George \\"Woody\\" Clarke wrote in Justice and Science: Trials and Triumphs of DNA Evidence that Gerdes contamination claim was rejected by every DNA expert at the criminal trial. The only reason it appeared convincing to the jury is because Judge Lance Ito allowed Gerdes to testify for six hours about contamination that occurred years ago in other cases instead of narrowing his testimony to only incidents in this case of which there were none.  Criticism of the court  leftJudge Lance Ito was criticized by Marcia Clark, Christopher Darden, Vincent Buligosi, Daniel Petrocelli, Darnel Hunt, and Jeffrey Toobin for his alleged poor stewardship of the trial. The criticism focused on allegations that he failed to control the court room and was unduly influenced by the media. Critics often compare his stewardship to judge Hiroshi Fujisaki who presided over the civil trial against Simpson. = Failure to control the courtroom = Defense attorney Robert Shapiro wrote in The Search for Justice that Judge Ito did give Scheck and Cochran more latitude than what was normally permitted. For instance, he allowed Johnnie Cochran and Barry Scheck to interrupt Marcia Clark's summation sixty-one times. Typically, no objections are permitted during opposing counsels closing statements. Buligosi criticized Ito for allowing the defense to argue that evidence was tampered with despite him ruling \\"there is no concrete evidence of tampering\\". Fuhrman criticized Ito for allowing Cochran to say during summations that \\"he lied when he said he didn't plant the glove\\" despite Ito ruling \\"It is a theory without factual support.\\" Prosecutor and DNA expert George \\"Woody\\" Clarke in Justice and Science: Trials and Triumphs of DNA Evidence criticized Ito because the only reason Gerdes contamination claim appeared convincing to the jury is because he allowed him to testify for six hours about contamination that occurred years ago in other cases instead of narrowing his testimony to only incidents in this case, of which there were none. Petrocelli opined in Triumph of Justice that \\"Ito had given the defense lawyers an astonishing amount of leeway...Ito did so because he believed, beyond any doubt...that Simpson would be found guilty so he gave the defense every break and benefit so that when the inevitable appeal was filed, the verdict would be bulletproof.\\" Superior Court Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki presided over the wrongful death civil trial and was praised for his stewardship as compared to Ito's at the criminal trial. Fujisaki gave neither Daniel M. Petrocelli, the plaintiff's attorney, nor Robert Baker, Simpson's attorney, any leeway beyond the scope of his ruilings. Judge Fujisaki prohibited all conspiracy claims because the defense could not provide any evidence supporting them and from attacking the LAPD and said \\"attack the evidence not the LAPD\\". Judge Fujisaki only allowed Dr. Gerdes to testify about contamination in the Simpson case only because the other cases were \\"irrelevant because it did not address the actual DNA test results in Mr. Simpson's case.\\" Dr.Gerdes admitted there were none in the Simpson Case. Judge Fujisaki also prohibited the defense from referencing Fuhrman's racism or perjury at the civil trial because the defense could not \\"show it had anything directly to do with this case\\" and the perjury \\"was not material to any facts in this case\\". Fuhrman did not testify at the civil trial after invoking his Fifth Amendment rights but Judge Fujisaki ruled the evidence that Fuhrman found was admissible because it was witnessed by the other officers present. Toobin wrote in Run of his Life that Judge Fujisaki was given high marks for his stewardship of the civil trial. Robert Baker said \\"He‚Äôs just a good judge, unbiased and fair.\\" = Media influence = Ito's decision to allow the trial to be televised was widely criticized. In 1998, Christopher Darden published his book, In Contempt, in which he criticized Ito as a \\"starstruck\\" judge who allowed the trial to turn into a media circus and the defense to control the court room while he collected hourglasses from fans and invited celebrities into his chambers. In interviews with Oprah Winfrey and Barbara Walters, Darden asserted his view that Simpson, Cochran, Shapiro and Bailey were running the courtroom, not Ito. References Category:O. J.

The ecoregion includes the mountain rain forests on the islands of New Britain and New Ireland, which lie northeast of New Guinea. Geography The ecoregion includes the montane rain forests on New Britain and New Ireland, two large islands in the Bismarck Archipelago lying northeast of New Guinea. it includes the portions of both islands above 1000 meters elevation.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment. Washington, DC: Island Press. New Britain is the largest island in the ecoregion, with an area of 36,520 km¬≤. New Ireland is the second-largest, with an area of 7,404 km¬≤. The archipelago is mostly made of volcanic rocks, with extensive areas of limestone. Several of the ecoregion's volcanoes are still active. The islands are generally mountainous. The highest point on New Britain is Mount Ulawun at 2,334 m (7,657 ft), and the highest point on New Ireland is Mount Taron at 2,340 m (7,680 ft). The montane rain forests are surrounded at lower elevations by the New Britain-New Ireland lowland rain forests. Climate The ecoregion has a montane tropical wet climate. Annual rainfall varies from 3000 to 6000 mm, depending on location. Temperature generally decreases with altitude, humidity increases, and fog and clouds are common.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment. Washington, DC: Island Press. Flora The predominant vegetation in the ecoregion is montane tropical rain forest. The transition from lowland rain forest to montane rain forest is gradual. Above 1000 meters elevation, species composition and forest structure change. Montane forests generally have a lower canopy than the lowland forests and lack buttressed roots, and many trees have smaller, glossy, dark-green leaves, called as laurophyll or lucidophyll. Epiphytes, including mosses, lichens, and orchids, are abundant. Soils are generally richer in humus than lowland soils.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment. Washington, DC: Island Press. Common trees in the montane forests include species of Araucaria, Lithocarpus, Castanopsis, Nothofagus, Syzygium, and Ilex. Castanopsis and Lithocarpus are common in montane forests of New Britain and on New Guinea, but mostly absent from New Ireland. Metrosideros salomonensis dominates the high-elevation forests of New Ireland. Fauna The ecoregion has 45 species of mammals. The majority are bats, and the rest are murid rodents or marsupials. The ecoregion has 3 endemic bird species ‚Äì the New Britain goshawk (Accipiter princeps), Bismarck thicketbird (Megalurulus grosvenori) and Bismarck honeyeater (Vosea whitemanensis). There are 27 near-endemic species, many of which also inhabit the lowland rain forests ecoregion.  Protected areas  A 2017 assessment found that 65 km¬≤, or less than 1%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. About half of the unprotected area is still forested.Eric Dinerstein, David Olson, et al. (2017).

Abrams's Bad Robot production company).  Background  Cardigan self- released a series of singles throughout 2018 that continually were placed on Spotify's New Music Friday editorial playlist. Within an 8 month span these songs accumulated 1 million streams. A quick rise in streaming numbers and a series of sold-out hometown shows attracted the attention of several record labels. On the writing of Vulnerabilia, he's said: > \\"It‚Äôs wild, actually: as a Pop music scene started forming in Nashville, > every writer in town that didn‚Äôt work on country music sort of got thrown > under that umbrella.

Through ‚Äô18 I would test songs out by > slipping them in and out of set lists at my shows, and the EP became > whatever resonated the most on stage.\\" He's commented that the title was imagined after a silent retreat at a monastery, and that it means \\"a collection of personal moments\\". Like his previous work, Cardigan self-produced and played every instrument on the EP. It was completed before Cardigan was signed to Capitol Records, and at one point was planned as an independent release..

The I√±upiaq name means \\"point\\" or \\"promontory of land\\" and refers both to the landform and the village. Archaeological evidence indicates that Point Barrow was occupied for over 1,500 years prior to the arrival of the first Europeans. Occupation continued into the 1940s. The headland is an important archaeological site, yielding Ipiutak artifacts, many burials and artifacts associated with the Thule culture, as well as artifacts from pre- and post-contact Iupiat occupation.  Research  Explorers = The first recorded visit of non-Natives to Nuvuk took place in 1826, in the form of an expedition led by Captain Frederick Beechey of the British Royal Navy, in command of the fifteen-gun sloop HMS Blossom. Although Beechey and Blossom did not get far past Icy Cape due to ice andshoal water, Blossom‚Äôs barge under the command of Thomas Elson and William Smyth made it as far as Point Barrow and the settlement of Nuvuk. By the early 1850s the residents of Nuvuk were aware of other European and American ships, and in some cases may have seen them while traveling, but the next ship to actually reach Point Barrow seems to have been HMS Plover under the command of Rochfort Maguire. Plover overwintered in 852 and 1853 in Elson Lagoon, adjacent to the village of Nuvuk . The village residents and the crew interacted quite a bit and Maquire recorded a considerable amount of information on the community. = Scientific investigations = The earliest primarily scientific expedition to North Alaska was the US Army Signal Corps expedition under Lt. Patrick Henry Ray. In 1881 the expedition established a station at Cape Smythe for the 1st International Polar Year (IPY). Although the expedition was primarily to collect meteorological and magnetic data, it produced one of the most important references for pre-and post-contact North Alaskan archaeology. The expedition purchased a large collection of I√±upiat material culture from the residents of Nuvuk and Utkiaƒ°vik (modern Barrow). Expedition member John Murdoch recorded ethnographic information and wrote a volume covering that as well as an exhaustive description of the material culture collected by the expedition. Vilhj√°lmur Stef√°nsson, came to the Barrow area in 1912 and spent some time with Charles Brower. He purchased many artifacts excavated by local residents, including from Nuvuk and Birnirk, which later were reported in several work . James A. Ford began his archaeological work on the North Slope in 1931. He had a full field season in 1932, working between Nuvuk and Walakpa, although his excavations at Nuvuk were quite limited. In 1951, Wilbert Carter began the first of three seasons of excavations at Piƒ°niq (Birnirk) and Nuvuk. The crew staged out of the Naval Arctic Research Laboratory (NARL), worked at Nuvuk (which at the time was actually on an island, since the Point Barrow spit was breached) until seasonal ice melt impeded access, then shifted operations to Piƒ°niq for the rest of the season. Over the three seasons, several cuts were excavated at Nuvuk. The material has yet to be published to any great extent. There are several preliminary reports and a so-called Final Report which remain unpublished.  Nuvuk Archaeological Project  The Nuvuk Archaeology Project (NAP) started after the repeated finding of eroding graves.The main focus of the NAP was the excavation of a cemetery that was discovered eroding at Nuvuk . Over 90 burials have been excavated from the eroding spit. They range in age from at least the Early to Late Western Thule cultures. Bayesian chronological modeling suggests that Northern Maritime occupation may have begun as early as 530‚Äì650 cal AD. These people are considered to be ancestors by the I√±upiat residents of Barrow, a point of view supported by genetic data. Researchers recorded the remnants of two Ipiutak structures which repent the first evidence of the Ipiutak north of Point Hope. They were located beneath the Thule and Inupiaq occupations, which were already known at Nuvuk. Nearly a meter of sterile gravel separated these structures from more recent occupation evidence; the beach ridge and sea level were much lower in Ipiutak times. One of the two loci suggested a catastrophic termination of the occupation by a storm surge, based on a strandline deposit which cut across the archaeological deposit. This material is dated to 300‚Äì400 cal AD, an early date for Ipiutak cultural material. Both loci were completely eroded within two months of their discovery. Another feature is a whaling captain‚Äôs work area likely from the 1870s or 80s, based on the combination of Euroamerican and traditional whaling gear. It was first exposed during geomorphological work on the erosion face in 2006 and was completely eroded within two years, before which only portions had been excavated. It is the only such feature on the North Slope to have been extensively excavated.

Built in the 1960s, it is today one of the biggest marinas in Europe.Quels sont les plus grands ports de France  History  In 1963, the N√Æmes Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI), with the assistance of Jean Bastide, launched the project to build a new marina on the Languedoc coast, as part of the Racine mission. The architect selected was Jean Balladur, who also drew up the plans for La Grande-Motte. Its construction began in 1969 with the creation of ponds, quays and piers. Then the first marinas were built. In 1974, the harbor office appeared. In 1980, the second phase of work concerning marinas was launched and in 1985 the initial CCI construction plan. Since then, under market pressure, town planning has continued to evolve with the construction of many additional marinas, apartments and villas. His R√©gie was chaired by √âtienne Mourrut when he was mayor of Le Grau-du-Roi .  Economy  With 4,600 berths, Port-Camargue is one of the top marinas in Europe. More and more permanent residents live there and commercial activity has intensified, with more than a hundred shops. Tourism, along with yachting and boating, is the essence of the economy of Port-Camargue. Note, moreover, the presence near Port-Camargue of numerous campsites and vast beaches (including that of Espiguette, which extends to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer).  Navigation and nautical information  Access to the marina is by a channel open to the northwest, in an axis leaving little room for swell. The bottom is sandy and dredged on average at 5 metres. Landing under sail in fairly strong mistral weather can be difficult but without any major risks. Note the presence for the arrival from the south of wave buoys opposite the Pointe de l'Espiguette. These are sometimes removed for maintenance reasons. They make it possible to indicate the limit of the area of sandbanks bordering along the beaches of the bay. When navigating nearby, the use of the depth sounder is highly recommended. Most of the rocky sand bars extend underwater for more than ten meters. Avoid approaching them too closely. The harbor master's office is on (almost) permanent standby on channel 9 and can be reached by telephone. Refueling is possible; the station is located after the reception area, following the most northerly channel (to port). Finally, note the presence of an SNSM speedboat, two sailing schools and a UCPA center.

In Super Smash Bros. for Wii U he won several minor tournaments but failed to take any of the premier- events, and was ranked as the 16th best player of all time in the game. In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate he has fared considerably better, winning several premier tournaments and claiming 3rd and 5th in the rankings for the first and second half of 2019, respectively. Marss has primarily used Zero Suit Samus in all three games in the Super Smash Bros franchise that he has competed in. As of Smash Ultimate, he is considered the best Zero Suit Samus player in the world, and has been noted for his aggressive style that capitalizes on the character's superior mobility. CareerEarly career and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U= Marss began competing in Smash with Super Smash Bros. Brawl. In 2013, he took 9th place at a minor tournament, Mega Mass Madness 5. He used Zero Suit Samus at the event. After Super Smash Bros. for Wii U released in late 2014, Marss quickly rose to prominence. He claimed the top spot in the regional rankings for his home region of New England, and alongside his brother, who played with the handle \\"Pugwest\\", also dominated the region's 2v2 competition. His first singificant result in a Smash competition came in December 2015, when he took second at the regional KTAR XV tournament, defeating several top players before losing to Nairoby \\"Nairo\\" Quezada in the finals. The next month, he tied for 7th at Genesis 3, before taking 3rd place at Pound 2016 in April. As a result of his strong showing in early Smash for Wii U events, Marss was ranked the 13th best player by the inaugural Panda Global Rankings. While Marss was able to attend more major tournaments in the second half of the year than the first, Pound 2016 was his highest placing at a premier tournament that year. He tied for 7th at The Big House 6, 9th at Evo 2016, Super Smash Con 2016, and UGC Smash Open, and 25th at CEO 2016. He did, however, claim another second-place finish at a mid-tier tournament, 2GGT: KTAR Saga. With these results, he fell two places to 15th in the second edition of the Panda Global Rankings, which covered the latter half of the year. In August 2016, shortly after his 9th-place finish at Evo 2016, Marss was signed by multi-esport organization Denial eSports. For the remainder of Marss' Smash for Wii U career, he would be unable to meet or beat his 13th place spot in the inaugural rankings. 2017 started out strong, with a 5th-place finish at 2GGC Civil War and 7th-place finishes at both CEO 2017 and CEO Dreamland, but after parting with Denial eSports in June, he did not attend most of the major tournaments held in the second half of the year. His best result of the year was 2nd at The Big House 7 in August, which saw him defeat Gonzalo \\"ZeRo\\" Barrios, the best Smash for Wii U player in the world, before losing to Samuel \\"Dabuz\\" Buzby in the finals. He also tied for 13th at Shine 2017, tied for 17th at GameTyrant Expo 2017, and tied for 25th at 2GGC: MKLeo Saga. He rose one position to 14th, then fell down to 19th, in the Panda Global rankings for the first and second halves of 2017, respectively. In 2018, Marss only appeared in three of the year's nine biggest tournaments, tying for 9th at CEO 2018, 17th at Frostbite 2018, and 49th at 2GG: Hyrule Saga. He also won two minor tournaments, Immortal Tech 2018 and Midwest Mayhem 12.8:36 With his absence from many events and his low placing at 2GG: Hyrule Saga, Marss dropped to 25th in the final bi-annual Panda Global Rankings for Smash for Wii U. Panda Global would later release a special list of the top 100 Smash for Wii U players of all time, and Marss was ranked 16th. Marss primarily used Zero Suit Samus in tournaments. His secondary characters were Lucario and Captain Falcon. =Super Smash Bros. Ultimate= Super Smash Bros. Ultimate was released in December 2018. In the first months of Smash Ultimate competition, Marss placed highly in several major tournaments and won several smaller events. After weak showings three of the major events held ‚Äì placing 17th in one and 25th in the other two ‚Äì Marss went on a streak of top-four finishes. In March, Marss was signed to Panda Global. He immediately went on to win the minor tournament Full Bloom 5, also winning its 2v2 event alongside fellow Panda Global player Brian \\"Cosmos\\" Kalu. He took 3rd in Pound 2019 in April, 2nd at Get On My Level 2019 and 3rd at MomoCon 2019 in May, and 4th at Smash 'N' Splash 5 and 2nd at CEO 2019 in June. In the inaugural Panda Global Rankings Ultimate, Marss was ranked 3rd, behind only Leonardo \\"MkLeo\\" L√≥pez P√©rez and Gavin \\"Tweek\\" Dempsey, the players that defeated him in the finals of CEO 2019 and Get On My Level 2019 respectively. In the second half of 2019, Marss continued to perform well. In July he traveled to Cholula, Puebla, Mexico and won Smash Factor 8, defeating MkLeo. In August he tied for 13th at Evo 2019, the largest offline tournament by number of entrants in the Smash Bros. franchise's history. Later that month he took 4th at two other major tournaments, Super Smash Con 2019 and Shine 2019. In September he won DreamHack Montreal 2019, took 3rd at Mainstage 2019, and tied for 7th at SwitchFest 2019. He would round out the year with a tie for 9th at the Smash Ultimate Summit 2 invitational tournament in October, and a win at Dreamhack Atlanta in November. Despite his wins at the two DreamHack events and strong showings at other tournaments, Marss fell to 5th in the Panda Global rankings for the second half of the year. In the first major tournament of 2020, Lets Make Big Moves, Marss tied for 5th. At the end of January he won Genesis 7, defeating MkLeo and denying the latter a fourth consecutive Genesis win. However at the next tournament, February's Frostbite 2020, Marss finished tied for 17th. Frostbite was the last major tournament held before Panda Global Rankings suspended the 2020 competitive season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While CEO 2020 no longer counted towards the rankings, the event still took place, though with a significant number of player cancellations. Marss took 4th in the event. As in previous editions of Smash, Marss primarily uses Zero Suit Samus in competition. In the first months of the game's release, he used Captain Falcon, Ike, and Mega Man as secondaries, though by the end of 2019 he had dropped Captain Falcon and Ike. =Zero Suit Samus= In a 2019 interview, Marss stated that he chose to use Zero Suit Samus because \\"she just looked cool\\". He is known for an extremely aggressive style of play,3:03 utilizing the character's high speed and mobility to overcome that many of her attacks are not powerful or are risky to use.2:33 The conventional wisdom in Smash games is to attempt to hold the center of the stage ‚Äì as the only way to die in the game is to be sent off of one of the edges ‚Äì but Marss often fights on the edges of the maps, using Zero Suit Samus' mobility to send people off the edge while safely recovering himself. He is also willing to \\"trade stocks\\" ‚Äì sacrifice one of his lives to ensure that he takes one from his opponent ‚Äì a technique few players are willing to use as consistently as Marss does. Marss is considered the best Zero Suit Samus player in the world. Personal life Marss was born in Rhode Island, United States. He is known for wearing pajama pants during competition.

His most familiar works are on Turkish themes.Biography and works @ the National Gallery (Athens)  Biography  His parents were prosperous merchants, and he was originally sent to study at the School of Commerce on the island of Heybeliada. In his spare time, he displayed a talent for drawing and sketching. As a result, he was enrolled in the architecture school at Athens Polytechnic University, where he studied from 1878 to 1880. While there, he made the acquaintance of , a shipping magnate who was a benefactor for numerous charities. With his support, Savvidis was able to attend the Academy of Fine Arts Munich, where he studied with Wilhelm von Diez, Ludwig von L√∂fftz and Nikolaos Gyzis. Upon completing his studies in 1887, he decided to remain there and stayed for over forty years. During that time, he made several trips to Asia Minor to gather material for his work. He held numerous exhibitions in Berlin, Leipzig, Hamburg, Vienna, Paris and London. Occasionally, he would have a showing in Athens. In his later years, he abandoned the Munich style in favor of more colorful, Impressionistic works. A man of wide ranging interests, he used the colors of dawn and sunset to develop a method for weather prediction. Despite his wide ranging activity, his works never achieved commercial success. The First World War broke most of his professional connections and left him close to poverty. In 1925, poor and sick, he moved to Athens, where he died two years later. A major retrospective was held there in 1931. The National Gallery of Greece presented a large exhibition of his paintings in 2006.

Biography Abdillahi was the son of Sultan Deria Hassan whom he succeeded. Sultan Abdillahi was a vehement anti- colonialist and felt strongly about the cessation of Haud Reserve and the Ogaden regions to Ethiopia. In the year 1948, he led a delegation of politicians and Sultans to the United Kingdom in order to petition and pressure the government in returning the lost Somali territories. In Imperial Policies and Nationalism in The Decolonization of Somaliland, 1954-1960, Historian Jama Mohamed writes: > The N.U.F. campaigned for the return of the territories both in Somaliland > and abroad. In March 1955, for instance, a delegation consisting of Michael > Mariano, Abokor Haji Farah and Abdi Dahir went to Mogadisho to win the > support and co-operation of the nationalist groups in Somalia. And in > February and May 1955 another delegation consisting of two traditional > Sultans (Sultan Abdillahi Sultan Deria, and Sultan Abdulrahman Sultan > Deria), and two Western-educated moderate politicians (Michael Mariano, > Abdirahman Ali Mohamed Dubeh) visited London and New York. During their tour > of London, they formally met and discussed the issue with the Secretary of > State for the Colonies, Alan Lennox-Boyd.

Early life Atiman was born in Tindirma, French Sudan, on the Niger River. He belonged to the Songhai ethnic group and was captured at a young age by members of the Tuareg, who sold him as a slave in Timbuktu. He passed through different hands before arriving in Metlili, Southern Algeria, where he was ransomed by the Missionaries of Africa, or White Fathers, who sent him to school in Algeria and Tunisia. Cardinal Lavigerie, archbishop of Carthage and Algiers, was impressed by Atiman's performance and arranged for him to study medicine at the University of Malta. Career In 1888, Atiman left on a mission with the White Fathers for Karema, on the shore of Lake Tanganyika, where he arrived in 1889. Karema was a new mission station on land recently transferred from the Congo Free State to German East Africa. Here he established himself as a medical catechist, or m√©decin-cat√©chiste. He married the daughter of the chief Wabende and had a son called Joseph. He frequently travelled to Kigoma and Albertville, where he could consult with other doctors in order to keep his medical knowledge up to date, as well as making long circuits through the countryside to provide medical aid in the villages.J. Grosjean, Atiman (Adrien), Biographie Belge d'Outre-Mer, vol. 7-C (1989), 12-16. He was awarded four British decorations, including the Royal African Society's Wellcome Medal, and received three Belgian awards for care given to colonial troops during World War I between 1916-18. In recognition of his career, Pope Pius XII appointed him a Knight-Commander of the Order of St. Sylvester. Death Atiman died in Karema at the age of more than 90, on 24 April 1956.

Monterrosa was on his knees and had his hands above his waist when Tonn shot him through the windshield of his unmarked police pickup truck. The police later said Tonn shot him because he erroneously believed a hammer in Monterrosa's pocket was a gun. Monterrosa later died at a local hospital. The event sparked outrage in the Bay Area, particularly in Vallejo, which has a long history of police violence, excessive force complaints, and high-profile killings, including the February 2018 shooting of Ronnell Foster and the February 2019 shooting of Willie McCoy.  Background  San Francisco, CA Sean Monterrosa (age 22) was of Argentinean descent. He grew up in San Francisco and attended an arts high school. He had worked for a Boys & Girls Club and had recently been working as a carpenter. Less than an hour before Monterrosa was shot, he texted his sister a petition demanding justice for George Floyd, who was killed by Minneapolis police a week earlier. Monterrosa was laid to rest on June 19, 2020. Monterrosa had prior arrests on suspicion of theft, shoplifting, shooting into a home, attempted murder, and weapons charges. Jarrett Tonn has been a police officer in the Vallejo Police Department since 2014, after working for the Galt Police Department from 2007 to 2014. Monterrosa's killing was the fourth time in five years that Jarrett Tonn had shot at a person while on duty, including two shootings within six weeks in 2017 and a shooting in 2015 where Tonn fired 18 times. None of the three prior shootings resulted in a death and Tonn was cleared of wrongdoing by internal investigations in each case. Fifteen days after the fatal shooting of Monterrosa, Tonn was named in an unrelated excessive force and civil rights lawsuit in federal court. Vallejo Police Department Over the last decade, Vallejo police have shot 32 people, 18 of whom were killed, in which time no officer has been fired for their role in a shooting. As of May 2019, the department had the highest per capita rate of police shootings in Northern California. Vallejo police killed people at a per capita rate over four times as high as neighboring city Richmond, a city with a similar population and similar high crime rate.  Incident  Monterrosa was killed at 12:30 a.m. on June 2, while the city of Vallejo was under curfew in response to looting. Police did not reveal his death until a June 3 news conference. Police chief Shawny Williams said police were responding to a report of a possible looting at a branch of Walgreens and when officers arrived they saw 10 to 12 people in the parking lot. Two vehicles, a black sedan and a silver pickup truck, fled the area, resulting in a car chase where the black car rammed an officer's car and injured an officer. Three detectives who were not involved in the chase arrived at the scene, in an unmarked pickup truck. Two detectives were in the front seat, and one was in the rear. As the truck arrived at the scene, the detective in the backseat mounted and aimed his rifle; the body camera he was wearing did not record sound in the seconds preceding the encounter. Just as the truck came to a stop, the detective in the back seat, later determined to be Jarrett Tonn, fired a rifle five times, through the windshield of the vehicle. One bullet struck Monterrosa in the back of the head. Immediately upon exiting the truck Tonn was recorded saying \\"What did he point at us?\\" The driver responded \\"I don't know man.\\" Tonn then shouted \\"Hey, he pointed a gun at us!\\" At no point in the immediate aftermath of the incident was the shooting officer separated from other involved officers. Tonn claimed Monterrosa appeared to be running towards the black sedan involved in the chase but he suddenly stopped, took a kneeling position, and placed his hands above his waist. No firearms were found with Monterrosa. The involved detectives claim that they mistook the end of a 15-inch hammer sticking out of his sweatshirt pocket for a gun.  Investigations and litigation Civil litigation= The Monterrosa family is represented by civil rights and police brutality attorney John Burris. Burris issued a statement condemning Tonn's overreaction as Monterrosa had done nothing to threaten the police and was not threatening anyone with a weapon, even if he had been armed with one. Burris said that \\"[t]here is a 22-year-old kid who is now dead who appeared to be surrendering and he is shot down in cold blood.\\" Burris also announced his intention to file a civil suit against the city of Vallejo. Following the release of the body camera footage, Burris said the footage made clear that there had been \\"no de-escalation\\" and \\"no justification\\" for the use of lethal force, and noted that police officials had offered multiple conflicting accounts of the shooting. On August 6, 2020, the Monterrosa family filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city of Vallejo and Jarrett Tonn. The lawsuit alleges that Monterrosa's civil rights were violated by unjustified use of deadly force when he was shot and killed by Tonn. =Destruction of essential evidence= On July 15, 2020, the Vallejo city manager's office announced that the windshield through which Tonn shot and killed Monterrosa had been destroyed without permission by a city employee, who had been placed on administrative leave and recommended for independent criminal investigation. =Independent investigation= In June 2020, U.S. Representative Mike Thompson and Assemblyperson Tim Grayson called for an independent investigation into the shooting, with Grayson saying that \\"it is absolutely unacceptable that the public was forced to wait for over 24 hours to learn of the conditions of those involved in the shooting,\\" regardless of the circumstances. On June 5, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced a general review of the Vallejo Police Department dating back to 2013. On July 2, 2020, Solano County District Attorney Krishna Abrams announced that she would recuse herself from investigations into the shooting, despite her office's key role in potential criminal charges against Tonn. On July 15, after confirming that essential evidence in the case had been destroyed by city staff, the city of Vallejo called for the California Department of Justice to begin an independent investigation. On July 17, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called for an FBI investigation into the killing and the Vallejo Police Department. On July 17, 2020, Becerra announced that the California Department of Justice would investigate the destruction of essential evidence by the city of Vallejo. Becerra said that the investigation was limited to the destruction of evidence and that he would relay any findings back to the Solano County District Attorney. As of October 2020, no state or federal criminal investigation or prosecution is currently underway. Monterrosa's sisters have called on Becerra and Governor Gavin Newsom to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the shooting and the Vallejo Police Department, as well as to charge and prosecute Jarrett Tonn and other officers and city staff involved in the shooting and the destruction of evidence. =Release of body camera footage= The Monterrosa family called for the release of videos related to the shooting, including police body camera footage, video from the police cruiser, and surveillance video from Walgreens. On June 16, 2020, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution urging the city of Vallejo to release the body camera video of the incident. Body camera footage was eventually released several weeks after the shooting. The footage does not show Monterrosa before he was shot, but shows Tonn firing from inside his car before he had fully stopped his vehicle. Tonn asked the driver, \\"What did he point at us?\\" to which the driver responded, \\"I don't know, man.\\" Tonn is heard shouting \\"This is not what I fucking needed today!\\" =Release of information= On June 2, 2020, at 4:08 am, police released a statement indicating that there had been an \\"officer-involved shooting\\" but declined to offer specifics on whether it was fatal and who was involved. Monterrosa had been declared dead two and a half hours before that press conference took place. At 3:00 pm on the afternoon of June 3, 2020 the Vallejo police chief announced that the previously disclosed shooting involved an officer fatally shooting someone. When asked to explain the delay in informing the public that an officer had killed someone, the chief stated that at the time of the initial statement Monterrosa had not been pronounced dead. In media reports on June 10, 2020 the public learned that the police chief's statement on June 3rd was not accurate information. In the later-released body camera footage of the incident, Tonn is heard saying first that Monterrossa pointed something at the police vehicle, then saying that Monterrossa pointed a gun at the police vehicle. In a press conference on June 5, 2020, the police chief said that the officers saw Monterrossa running toward a car at the scene, that he stopped, took a kneeling position, and placed his hands above his waist, revealing what appeared to be the butt of a handgun. On June 5, the Vallejo police union released a statement, saying that Monterrosa ‚Äúabruptly pivoted back around toward the officers, and crouched into a tactical shooting position,‚Äù that the hammer ‚Äúappeared to be the butt of a gun, and that the officer fired, ‚Äúas a last resort.‚Äù The name of the officer involved was not released by the police department. The Bay Area News Group identified the shooter as Jarrett Tonn on June 5. On June 15, the Vallejo police union filed a temporary restraining order to prevent the release of the name of any officer involved in the killing. On June 16, the city of Vallejo announced it would oppose the motion in court and would ‚Äúseek to defend the [c]ity‚Äôs right to release the name of the officer(s) at a time and through a method of its choosing.‚Äù  Memorials, protests, and reactions  In June 2020, protestors began gathering in Vallejo and across the Bay Area to ask for officers involved to be charged \\"to the fullest extent of the law\\" and to call for the release of body camera video. On June 5, a \\"Justice for Sean Monterrosa\\" protest was held at Mission and 24th Street in San Francisco. In July and August 2020, a billboard calling for \\"Justice for Sean Monterrosa\\" and featuring a portrait of Monterrosa from the Justice for Our Lives project was displayed above 624 Irving Street in San Francisco. On September 22, 2020, a \\"Justice for Sean Monterrosa\\" billboard was put up a block away from the Vallejo Police Department. On September 27, after a march from Wilson Park to the billboard, a moment of silence was held and Monterrosa's sisters gave statements. On October 2, 2020, the four-month anniversary of Monterrosa's death, a protest was staged on the driveway outside Governor Gavin Newsom's house. A group of 17 protestors, including Monterrosa's sisters and members of Justice League CA, demanded Newsom appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the case. The protestors were later arrested and detained overnight in Sacramento County Jail.

The situation in Afghanistan  Amanullah Khan on a visit to Moscow. Since 1919, close diplomatic relations were established between the RSFSR (hereinafter referred to as the USSR) and the Kingdom of Afghanistan, contrary to British interests. In April 1923, a new constitution was adopted in Afghanistan. Among the reforms carried out by Amanullah Khan were the prohibition of polygamy and marriage with minors, the abolition of the obligatory wearing of a veil for women , which led to the creation of a powerful opposition (primarily Muslim clergies). In March 1924, a major uprising broke out in Hazarajat. In September 1924, at the invitation of Amanullah Khan, a mission from 11 Soviet flight instructors arrived in Kabul. It was planned to create their own air force in Afghanistan. The United Kingdom, which had already provided Amanullah with de Havilland airplanes , protested, but Amanullah Khan ignored it. On 6 October, Soviet pilots in British aircraft made combat sorties to the Khostinsky rebels area, and on October 14, they bombed rebel bases in the Khost and Nadral regions. On 15 September 1927, the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided to transfer to the southern neighbor 12 R-1 airplanes, 2 anti-aircraft batteries (8 guns) and funds for the flight school.. At the same time, a wave of emigrants from the Central Asian republics who fled from Soviet power swept the north of Afghanistan. In their midst, with the financial and material (arms) support of the United Kingdom, a movement was strengthened that was called Basmachism in the Soviet Union, and its members called themselves Mujahideen. The most influential leader of this movement was Ibrahim Bek. The Soviet government exerted strong pressure on the Afghan government. Amanullah Khan sharply limited access to help the British intelligence agencies. In November 1928, a new uprising broke out in eastern Afghanistan. It was led by the HabibullƒÅh KalakƒÅni (Bacha-ye Saqao). Many researchers believe that he was supervised by T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia). Tajik historian Kamoludin Abdullaev does not confirm this idea. Habibullah Kalakani. Habibullah was supported by religious leaders. He accused Amanullah Khan of violating the Sharia, declaring the abolition of all bourgeois reforms, promising the abolition of the land tax, conscription, and announcing the cancellation of debts, which attracted a huge crowd. Justice was to be administered by the Sharia court. Schools were closed, and education was transferred under the control of the mullahs. In addition, Khabibulla established close contacts with the leader of the Basmachi movement, Ibrahim Bek, and former Emir of Bukhara, Mohammed Alim Khan. On 11 December 1928, Habibullah was proclaimed the Padishah of Afghanistan, and on January 13 he was declared emir \\"Habibullah II\\". On 14 January 1929, Amanullah Khan abdicated and fled to Kandahar. On 17 January, Habibullah occupied Kabul. Ethnic and religious slaughter began in the city. Pashtuns, professing Sunni Islam, massacred the Shia Hazaras. The pogroms of schools, factories, radio stations began. State control over other provinces of Afghanistan was lost. Chaos reigned in the country. Ibrahim Bek recalled that riots had begun, one village went to another, settling old accounts. Afghan historian Mir Gulam Muhammad Gubar, a contemporary of those events, wrote that the reign of Habibullah was a tragedy for the country.  Squad formation  Vitaly Primakov. Selection in the detachment was conducted by the deputy commander Germanovich. The Afghan detachment was replenished by the Red Army from the 81st cavalry and 1st mountain rifle regiments, as well as the 7th cavalry artillery division of the Red Army with 4 mountain guns, 12 easel and 12 light machine guns. The detachment had a powerful mobile radio station, was perfectly armed, equipped and had a sufficient supply of provisions. All the Red Army men were dressed in Afghan uniforms. The commanders received Asian names, which were to be called in the presence of the Afghans. The command of the detachment was entrusted to V. M. Primakov (under the pseudonym of the Turkish officer Ragib Bey, the call sign was ‚ÄúVitmar‚Äù). The chief of staff was appointed personnel officer Afghan Hai Dar. Formally, the detachment was subordinate to the Afghan General G. Nabi Khan. On 10 April, a detachment of about 2,000 soldiers was already ready for action.  Invasion of Afghanistan  Attack on Patta Gissar = In the early morning of 15 April 1929, six aircraft equipped with machine guns crossed the Soviet-Afghan border in the Uzbek city of Termez and appeared over the Afghan border post of Patta Gissar. The garrison employees, not taking proper precautions, went out to look at the aircraft. Airplanes, having made two rounds of the deployed front, sank and fired machine guns at the Afghan border guards. Several bombs were dropped that destroyed the barracks. Of the 50 Afghans who made up the garrison, only two survived. The entire operation lasted 10 minutes. Meanwhile, a detachment led by Vitaly Primakov, crossed the Amu Darya and landed on the Afghan coast via motor boats, cabins and barges. Two surviving Afghan border guards made their way to the neighboring Siya-Gert border post, 20 miles away, and reported what had happened. A garrison of 100 sabers immediately went to Patta Gissar, but after five miles of the road collided with the enemy and was destroyed by machine gun fire. At the same time, Amanullah Khan with 14,000 Hazaras advanced from Kandahar to Kabul. = Capture of Kelif, Khanabad and Mazar-i-Sharif = On 16 April, Primakov‚Äôs detachment approached the city of Kelif. The garrison was given an ultimatum with a proposal to lay down their arms and go home. The Afghans rejected the demands of the Soviet side, but, after several exchanges of gunfire and machine-gun fire, they fled. On 17 April, the city of Khanabad was taken, the defenders of which took refuge in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif. On the night of 18 April, the governor of Mazar-i-Sharif, Mirza Kasym, summoned the Soviet Consul General, with whom he had friendly relations, and demanded clarification on what was happening. The consul was put in a difficult position, since he himself was not informed about this operation of the Red Army on Afghan territory. On the morning of 22 April, Primakov‚Äôs detachment began shelling Mazar-i-Sharif. Machine guns hit the defenders on the walls. Two hours after the start of the battle, the gunners brought the guns to the entrance to the citadel and, having launched a volley, broke the gate. The detachment burst into the city. Part of the remaining garrison fled to Tashkurgan, while others took refuge in the nearby fortress of Dehdadi. A huge number of corpses mutilated by artillery fire lay at the gate. On the same day. a telegram was sent to Tashkent, and from there a dispatch was sent to Moscow: ‚ÄúMazar is busy with Wittmar‚Äôs detachment‚Äù. According to the then Soviet Consul General in Mazar-i-Sharif: According to another eyewitness, the illegal representative of the intelligence agency in Mazar-i-Sharif, Matveev: During the week of the campaign, 500 Hazaras joined the detachment, of which they formed a separate battalion. = The hold of Mazar-i-Sharif = At the council of heads of administrations, military leaders and Islamic scholars, it was decided to declare a jihad against the invasion of the \\"infidels\\" on their land, to gather a militia to meet the enemy. On 24 April, the garrison of the Dehdadi fortress and tribal militias tried to drive Primakov‚Äôs detachment from Mazar-i-Sharif. The fight lasted all day. Numerous, but poorly armed Afghans, with prayers and religious chants, went on the attack in a thick formation in an open area under gun and machine-gun fire. Despite the enormous losses, one wave of attackers was replaced by another.By the end of the day, the attacks stopped, but the position of the besieged was critical. The city was surrounded by a dense ring. A radio transmission was sent to Tashkent asking for help. On 25 April, a machine-gun squadron was urgently deployed through Amu Darya to Afghanistan, but on the way to Mazar-i-Sharif he was met by superior forces of Afghan militias and was forced to return. On 26 April, 10 machine guns and 200 artillery shells were delivered to Mazar-i-Sharif by airplanes. Unable to take the city by force, the Afghans, in order to force Primakov‚Äôs detachment to surrender, blocked all the irrigation ditches leading to the city at night and set about sieging. The situation in the city was getting worse. A less disciplined Afghan battalion began to murmur. Primakov delivered a report to Tashkent:  Second Unit Invasion  On 5 May 1929, to help Primakov‚Äôs detachment, a second Red Army detachment of 400 men was sent with 6 guns and 8 machine guns, under the command of a certain Zelim Khan (there is no direct documentary evidence of this, but many facts indicate that it was the commander of the 8th cavalry brigade of the Central Asian Military District, Ivan Yefimovich Petrov). The detachment was also dressed in Afghan uniform. On the way, he was confronted by a border outpost, which \\"in a matter of minutes was swept away\\" by the machine gun fire of the Red Army. = Capture of Dehdahi, Balkh and Tashkurgan = On 6 May, on the positions of the Afghans, near Mazar-i-Sharif, the Central Asian Military District aviation launched bombing and assault strikes. Within a two-day period, the Zelim Khan squadron, after a quick throw, went to Mazar-i-Sharif on 7 May and, together with the Primakov‚Äôs detachment, attacked the Afghans who had retreated to Dehdadi. On 8 May, after airstrikes and shelling, the garrison left the fortress, leaving it with 50 guns, 20 machine guns, a large number of small arms and ammunition. After a two-day rest, on 10 May, Primakov‚Äôs combined detachment moved in several columns further south, towards Balkh and Tashkurgan. On 12 May, Primakov‚Äôs detachment occupied Balkh, and the next day, not meeting any resistance, entered the city of Tashkurgan. = Battle with the troops of Ibrahim Bek and Seyid Hussein = From the east, against the Primakov detachment, Ibrahim Bek advanced with 3,000 soldiers. Habibullah‚Äôs National Guard emerged from Kabul with 1,500 soldiers, under the command of Minister of War, Seyid Hussein. On 11 May, one of the columns of 350 people discovered a detachment of Ibrahim Bek. Immediately on the main line were eight guns. On the flanks, 200 meters from the road, two machine guns were installed. Sights were taken in advance. When approaching the Ibrahim Bek column at 500 meters, artillery opened fire. Three guns hit the columns in the head, three in the tail, and two in the center. Hidden machine guns were launched from the flanks. Ibrahim's soldiers rushed in different directions. Many of them were killed by the Red Army during the chase. Half an hour after the start of the battle, a detachment of Seyid Hussein discovered the patrol westward. A participant in those events, platoon commander, A. Valishev, left a detailed description of the battle picture: Seyid Hussein, leaving his units, fled. According to the representative of the reconnaissance unit in Mazar-e-Sharif Matveev, when the detachment returned on the same road, the decomposed corpses still lay uncleaned.  Squad return  The flight from Afghanistan of Amanullah Khan put Cherepanov‚Äôs detachment in a difficult position. In the absence of any legal basis to be inside the country, the stay of the aircraft on its territory was regarded as aggression by the USSR. In addition, in European countries, as well as in Turkey and Iran, it became known about the invasion of the Red Army in Afghanistan. On 28 May, Cherepanov received a radiogram from the Central Asian Military District headquarters on his return to his homeland. G. Nabi Khan moved to Termez, Uzbek SSR.  Consequences  The operation of the Red Army in Afghanistan did not change the situation in the country. More than 300 participants in the campaign were awarded the Order of the Red Banner, and the rest with valuable gifts. In the documents of military units, this operation is listed as The Elimination of Banditry in South Turkestan, and its description in historical works was prohibited.

Kanmogne is a Cameroonian American geneticist and molecular virologist and a Full Professor and Vice Chair for Resource Allocation and Faculty Development within the Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Neurosciences at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska. Kanmogne's research program focuses on exploring the pathogenesis of neuroAIDS by deciphering the mechanisms underlying blood brain barrier dysfunction and viral entry into the central nervous system. Her research also addresses the lack of HIV therapies that cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and has played a critical role in the development of nanoparticles encapsulating HIV-drugs that can cross the BBB to prevent viral-mediated neuron death in the brain. Kanmogne collaborates with clinical and basic researchers across America, Cameroon, and West Africa, spanning disciplines from hematology to psychiatry, to explore how viral genetic diversity is correlated with the neurological impact of HIV.  Early life and education  Kanmogne was born and raised in Cameroon. She was one of six children in her family and was the first of all of them to attend high school or college. In her adolescent years, Kanmogne was an altar server and sang in the youth choir at her parish. She contemplated becoming a nun throughout high school, though by the time she graduated, she had recognized her passion for science and had committed to pursuing an undergraduate degree at the University of Yaound√© in Cameroon. Kanmogne completed her Bachelor of Science in Zoology in 1987, and then pursued her Master's of Science in Biochemistry at the University of Yaound√©, completing her degree in 1989. For two years following her Master's, from 1990 to 1992, Kanmogne worked as a Laboratory Instructor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Yaound√©. In 1992, Kanmogne moved to the United Kingdom to pursue her graduate training at the University of Bristol. She studied Molecular Parasitology under the mentorship of Wendy C. Gibson, exploring the biology of Trypanosoma brucei. Kanmogne used a novel genetic technique at the time, random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), to characterize the genetic heterogeneity of T. brucei gambiense isolates from endemic areas in Africa. Her work was the first to show that the RAPD method is as accurate as the RFLP method at characterizing genetic variation, while also achieving a more detailed genetic analysis. Kanmogne also explored more effective ways to diagnose sleeping sickness caused by T. brucei since its levels are very low. She developed a novel PCR method that was highly sensitive and could be used to effectively diagnose sleeping sickness at levels of 25 trypanosomes/ml of blood. Kanmogne completed her graduate training in 1996, and stayed in the United Kingdom for her postdoctoral work at the University of Cambridge in the Department of Haematology. She began studying HIV during her postdoc, specifically exploring the CD4+ T-lymphocyte levels in patients with AIDS as well as the specific biology of human T-cell leukaemia virus type I infection in West African patients with AIDS. In 1998, Kanmogne moved to the United States to pursue further postdoctoral training in the Department of Pathology at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. While continuing to study HIV, Kanmogne pursued a Master of Public Health in Biostatistics and Epidemiology at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center from 2000 to 2002. Under the mentorship of Ronald C. Kennedy, Kanmogne continued to study HIV, but now with an emphasis on the infiltration of HIV into the central nervous system and the lungs. Since the exact mechanisms of HIV invasion into the brain as well as subsequent neuronal cell death were unknown, Kanmogne's work explored the susceptibility of brain endothelial cells and cortical neurons to HIV-1 infection. She discovered that neither cell type expressed the known HIV receptors, CXCR4 and CCR5, and thus other cell types or mechanisms just mediate CNS-HIV infection. Kanmogne then explored using non-human primate (NHP) microglia to study HIV pathogenesis in the brain. She found that NHP microglia express HIV-1 receptors and can be used to study HIV pathogenesis. In addition to studying HIV infection in the CNS, Kanmogne also explored HIV infection in the lung since the onset of AIDS is associated with severe pulmonary complications. She found that human lung microvascular endothelial cells are not a major reservoir of HIV in the lungs, but they do represent a target for the lethal effects of HIV viral proteins.  Career and research  In 2002, Kanmogne was hired as a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Pathology at the University of Oklahoma Health Science Center. She continued to study the vascular biology of HIV infection and the effects of HIV infection on the central nervous system. Kanmogne was then recruited to the University of Nebraska Medical Center in 2005 where she became an Assistant Professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Neuroscience, as well as a Senior Scientist in the Center for Neurovirology and Neurodegenerative Disorders. In 2008, she was promoted to Associate Professor and became the Vice Chair for Resource Allocation and Faculty Development within the Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Neuroscience. In 2012, Kanmogne received tenure and in 2015, she was promoted to Full Professor within the department. Kanmogne is a member of the American Society for Virology and the International Society for NeuroVirology. At the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Kanmogne is also the Principal Investigator of a lab that explores the mechanisms of HIV-1 brain invasion and the vascular biology of HIV infection. Her work has led to critical discoveries about the role of blood brain barrier (BBB) interactions with HIV as well as how these interactions influence the immune response in the brain leading to neuroAIDS, including neurodegeneration and AIDS associated dementia. She has found that HIV affects the biology of the brain endothelium and that proximity of HIV-infected peripheral macrophages to the brain can lead to increased immune signalling, BBB facilitated infiltration of peripheral leukocytes into the brain. Kanmogne is also deeply committed to extensive collaboration and diversity in academia. She currently collaborates with several departments within the University of Yaound√© in Cameroon and the University of California San Diego, and her international research project explores the viral genetic diversity of HIV infections in Cameroon and West Africa. She hopes that her projects will enhance the ability of healthcare workers in Cameroon and West Africa to better diagnose and treat HIV. Further, since Cameroon has some of the highest diversity of HIV strains and subtypes, her work exploring the genetic variants of HIV in relation to neurological symptoms will help to highlight potential disease trajectories associated with each subtype as well as open up possibilities for novel therapeutic development. = HIV infected monocytes and blood brain barrier dysfunction = Kanmogne and her colleagues discovered that the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, gp120, activates the CCR5 and CXCR4 receptors on the surface of human brain microvasculature endothelial cells (HBMECs) leading to toxicity and BBB leakage. They further showed that blocking gp120 or its associated receptors actually prevents monocyte migration and permeability of the BBB via the PKC pathway. Kanmogne and her colleagues later found that HIV-1 causes STAT-1 activation in HBMECs leading to IL-6 expression which mediates the recruitment of monocytes across the BBB. To further delineate the mechanisms of HIV-infection leading to neuroinflammation, Kanmogne and her colleagues found that the CCR5 chemokine receptor mediated HIV-1 binding to HBMECs and that cross talk between STAT1 and PI3K pathways were mediating the BBB dysfunction after HIV infection. = Cognitive impairments due to HIV = Kanmogne and her colleagues also hoped to explore the cognitive impairments due to HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa, so developed novel methods to do so. The team reported the first normative data for executive function and verbal fluency in Cameroonians and this established the ability to use this method for future assessments of cognitive function in patients with and without HIV infection. They further conducted a cross-sectional study of the HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) using the International HIV Dementia Scale among a population in Cameroon. They found that the risk factors for HAND are similar to those described in other studies, underscoring the need to start to assess risk factors as a means of HANDS prevention in Cameroon. = Nanomedicines for HIV = In order to treat the neurocognitive symptoms of HIV, therapeutics must enter the brain so Kanmogne and her team are developing novel nanomedicines to achieve this. The first developed a nanoformulated crystalline antiretroviral therapy in 2012 which allows for drugs to be passed through the BBB through cell-to-cell contact between monocytes and HBMECs. They found that the therapy in mice led to decreased activation of glial cells and decreased viral load in the spleen. Next, they developed a method in 2018 that uses polyanhydride nanoparticles containing antioxidants that are internalized and then transferred from monocytes to HBMECs in order to protect neurons from oxidative stress associated with infection and inflammation. This therapy showed positive results in its potential to be used as a method to enhance drug transport across the BBB.

This is the first adaptation of the novel to be directed by a woman (who also co-scripted). Plot Jonathan Harker on behalf of his employer, Mr. Hawkins travels to Transylvania to close a real estate transaction with Count Dracula. Jonathan keeps a written daily journal. Harker meets fearful, superstitious people on the coach to Bukovina. They are frightened at the mention of Dracula's name, and because Jonathan plans to go to the castle by night. A woman in the carriage gives him a crucifix. The coach only takes Jonathan so far, then Dracula's own carriage picks him up. The Count himself, in disguise, drives the carriage. On their way to the castle, wolves chase the carriage. The Count sends them away. At the castle, Jonathan is greeted by the Count, who is bearded and robust. Dracula helps Jonathan with his bags and shows him to his room, making excuses as to the absence of his servants. Jonathan enjoys a supper in which the Count does not join him. Jonathan and Dracula discuss the sale of Carfax, the old London estate that the Count wants to buy. Dracula tells Jonathan he must stay at the castle for a while, in order to help the Count perfect his English. Jonathan cuts himself shaving, and in his shaving mirror he notices that the Count has no reflection. The sight of the blood excites the Count, but the crucifix repulses him. Dracula takes Harker's mirror and tosses it out of the window. Jonathan soon realizes that he is alone at the castle with Dracula and that Dracula is not human. He wonders around the castle, falls asleep in one room and is attacked by three vampire woman - who refer to each other as Marquess, Countess and Madame. Dracula stops their attack and gives the women a baby to feed on. Next evening Dracula tells Jonathan to write false letters home, in which he is to say that he already has left Transylvania. A woman comes to the castle, pleading for the return of her child, but wolves kill her. That night Jonathan sees Dracula climb head-first down the castle's wall. Getting desperate to find the key to the castle's front door and escape, Jonathan climbs out of his window and down an outer wall. He sees gypsies loading coffins to the carriage in the yard. Jonathan soon finds a vault in which the three vampire women repose in coffins, each in a deathlike trance. He finds the Count, also in a coffin in a similar state. Jonathan searches Dracula for the key. Unable to find it, he tries to kill the Count with a shovel, but fails. Jonathan makes a desperate leap to escape. Back in London, Jonathan celebrates being home from the hospital. He is among his friends - Arthur Holmwood and Lucy, Dr. John Seward and Harker's own wife Mina. Jonathan is suffering from amnesia and has no recollection of what happened to him, while he was abroad and doesn't want to remember, since he only knows that it was something unpleasant. Mina says that she hid his journal from him, so he wouldn't get upset by the memories. Lucy meanwhile is disappointed that he can't remember, she was looking forward to hearing what he had to say about the Carpathians, since she's interested in going there herself someday. She says she'd like to borrow Jonathan's journal, and she seems so impatient to do so, she becomes agitated and passes out. Arthur reveals that Lucy suffers for three weeks from a mysterious illness that leaves her pale and weak. She also has two tiny wounds on her throat. Lucy's illness baffles Dr. Seward, so he sends for Professor Van Helsing to come from Holland to have a look at her. Van Helsing places garlic in Lucy's room and also prescribes her garlic cream and peppermint tea. But Lucy removes the garlic and Dracula enters her room. Lucy's mother, who was with her at that moment, dies of heart attack. Despite blood transfusion, Lucy quickly fades away and on her deathbed beckons Arthur. Her teeth appear longer and sharper. Shortly afterwards, Lucy dies and is buried. At Lucy's funeral, Mina suddenly turns around and then begins to walk, as if in trance, towards something, or somebody. Jonathan stops her and then sees the Count and recognizes him, but the Count vanishes. When Van Helsing asks him what's wrong, Jonathan says that he knows what's happened to him in the Carpathians and who is guilty of Lucy's death. Three nights after she was buried Arthur is grieving in her room, when he hears and sees Lucy calling to him outside. But he understands that she is not really Lucy anymore and repels her with garlic. Lucy leaves, but wickedly promises Arthur that she'll still get him, as he is still her groom. Van Helsing and others gather together to discuss what they are to do now. Arthur tells them that Lucy came to him. Van Helsing shows them newspaper, describing how three children have been kidnapped or wounded in the neck in the past few days after being kissed by a woman in white. While all the men are deeply concerned by these news, Mina is smiling strangely. Van Helsing tells them that they need to open the coffin of Lucy and cut her head off. Arthur is horrified and appalled, but Harker supports Professor. Van Helsing asks Jonathan to give him his journal, but when Harker asks his wife what she has done with it, Mina says that she doesn't know what he is talking about. Jonathan finds the journal hidden among Mina's things, decides that she is tired and should go to bed. Mina briefly touches her throat with her hand. Van Helsing leads Seward, Holmwood and Harker to the graveyard by night. Inside the tomb they find that Lucy's coffin is empty. Soon Lucy returns to the tomb carrying the child, which she drops when Van Helsing and others confront her. Lucy sweetly calls Arthur to come with her, but retreats from Van Helsing's crucifix and returns to her tomb. Professor seals it and they wait till daybreak. Then they re-enter Lucy's tomb and Arthur stakes Lucy, while Van Helsing reads a prayer. The peaceful expression appears on Lucy's face and Professor allows Arthur to kiss her. Van Helsing and other men discuss what they know about their enemy, Dracula. Van Helsing has written to Budapest University and from the answer knows that Count Dracula is Voivode Dracula, who became famous in battles against the Turks. He also talks about vampire's strength and weaknesses, including the need to rest in his home soil, and how Dracula wants to increase his empire of the undead by moving to London. They suddenly hear the laughter in next room, run there and find unconscious Mina on the floor. On her neck they discover two wounds. The men go to Carfax, a place Harker sold to Dracula in London, and sterilize the boxes with communion wafers. However, two boxes are missing. Dracula confronts them there, Jonathan takes a swing at him with his knife, but it only slashes the Count's coat, and gold coins spill out. Dracula grabs the coins and flees, leaping out of the window. Jonathan realizes that they left Mina at home completely alone. Meanwhile, Dracula enters Mina's room, drinks her blood, then slashes his chest and makes her drink his blood, saying that now she belongs to him and if he says to her \\"come\\", she will come to him. The men burst in, but are too late. Van Helsing tries to break Dracula's hold and presses wafer to Mina's forehead, but it burns her. Professor understands that now they have to rely on Mina's psychic link to Dracula to learn where he is. They find out that Dracula is on the ship and is heading back to Transylvania. The heroes go by train to win time. When they reach Dracula's castle, Mina becomes excited, behaves as if she is at home, runs from Jonathan across castle's halls, laughing wantonly and igniting the lights in the castle by the mere swish of her hand. The heroes spent night in the castle, putting garlic wreaths as barrier in the room. Three vampire women appear, but they can't enter the room. They call out to Mina, call her their sister and promise to teach her lovely things, teach her to drink blood, promise to give her all those men who are with her now. Mina wants to go to them, but is stopped by Arthur. Next morning Van Helsing and Dr.Seward stake three vampire women and they crumble into dust. After Dracula's wagon arrives, the gypsies run away upon finding he's in the coffin-shaped box they've delivered. The men try to attack Dracula, but he gets away from them, telling Harker that Mina is his and coming with him. Mina runs off again, and Jonathan once more has to go chase her down. Dracula intercepts her, with an open arms, but Jonathan throws a dagger that pierces his heart. Dracula turns into dust, while mark disappears from Mina's forehead. Jonathan's journal ends with a note that all these events happened seven years ago, and that the castle still stands as it has before.

In Poland, he was employed at WAT (Technical Military Academy in Warsaw) as professional officer till 1968; in Switzerland, he worked at the Hauptabteilung f√ºr die Sicherheit der Kernanlagen (HSK - Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate). In the last years of his life, he engaged in reviving the memory of Shoah, in the Ukraine and in Switzerland, and a movie was made on his life and perpetuation activities. Early life in Poland Jerzy Czarnecki (nicknamed \\"Yurek\\" or ‚ÄúJurek‚Äù) was born in the Polish township Mosty Wiekie (currently Ukraine: Velyki Mosty) as Isaac Steger. His education at the gymnasium in Zhovkva was interrupted with the West Ukraine‚Äôs conquest by Nazi Germany. In 1942, he fled from Mosty Wielkie, coming to Warsaw. He was then brought to Stralsund where he worked as forced laborer. After the end of the war, he enrolled in Polish army and studied engineering at Leningrad and Warsaw Universities, up to doctoral degree, specializing in nuclear pollution control. He worked at WAT as professional officer (Lieutenant colonel) and reader, also developing patents, until he had to quit the position in the aftermath of the 1968-anti-semitic wave. Years in Switzerland Dr. Czarnecki obtained asylum in Switzerland in 1972. Two years later he was appointed at the HSK- Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate, at the section of radio-logical surveillance, remaining there till his retirement, in 1989. At the HSK, his major task was to refine measurement techniques of nuclear air pollution. His research was published in several journals, including Health Physics in 1983. After his retirement, Dr. Czarnecki acted as nuclear expert, travelling on several special missions to Ukraine, in the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor explosion. In the year 2002, he published his life-memoires under the title ‚ÄúMein Leben als ‚ÄòArier‚Äô. J√ºdische Familiengeschichte in Polen zur Zeit der Scho√°h und als Zwangsarbeiter in Deutschland‚Äù. This book was translated into English and appeared in 2007 under the title: ‚ÄúMy Life as an ‚ÄòAryan‚Äô: From Velyki Mosty through Zhovkva to Stralsund‚Äù, and was endorsed by Yad Vashem. Reviving Jewish history Czarnecki‚Äôs remaining years were dedicated to reviving the Jewish past in Velyki Mosty, and in Switzerland. His and his family‚Äôs attempts to clean the ruin of the synagogue and to erect a monument to commemorate the killing of 1500 Jews in the local ‚ÄúBabki‚Äù forest were supported by the municipality and by local population. The monument was inaugurated on October, 8th, 2006. In 2006, Czarnecki was granted a Honorary Citizenship by the Velyki Mosty City Council. Czarnecki died in Zurich in December 2007. Personal life Jerzy Czarnecki married Janina Pyzuk in 1954; in 1956 his daughter Joanna Pfaff-Czarnecka was born. ‚ÄòMy Life as an ‚ÄòAryan‚Äù Czarnecki‚Äôs book documents his dramatic life story as an Eastern European Jew against the backdrop of violent European history. It describes the often precarious coexistence between the Jews, Poles and Ukrainians in the region of Lviv, before the World War II, and the increasing cruelty towards the Jews under the Nazis, resulting in the death of almost the entire Jewish population of Mosty Wielkie and of the entire region. The book also depicts Czarnecki‚Äôs escape from his native West-Ukraine and his struggle for survival till 1945. Important passages of the book also describe the bravery of Polish activists and families who came to the rescue of Czarnecki and his relatives. He appealed to Yad Vashem to have Wladyslawa and Waclaw Rybak as well as Jozefa Paluch recognised as 'The Righteous among the Nations' by Yad Vashem. The English edition documents this title as being conferred to Zofia and Jozef Piotrowski who saved Jerzy's mothernal Aunt hela Graubart and her husband Aharon. ‚ÄòFrom Galicia to Aargau‚Äô In 2005, Czarnecki became the protagonist of Susy and Peter Scheiner‚Äôs film ‚ÄúFrom Galicia to Aargau: Trails of a Jewish European in the 20th century‚Äú. The main part of the film is Jerzy Czarnecki‚Äôs journey to Mosty Wielkie that he undertakes for the first time after more than 60 years, after his escape. It shows that this township barely remembers its Jewish past. At the same time, Czarnecki is welcomed by the local people, most of whom never met a Jewish person. The movie follows Czarnecki‚Äôs efforts to erect the monument in memory of the Jews of the town and also shows the desecration of it by unknown villains. Reactions to the book and movie The book was widely received. The renown newspaper 'Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung' invited Czarnecki to provide a full page text for its Saturday-edition (Zeitfragen). Jerzy Czarnecki was repeatedly invited to schools, churches and civil society fora to speak on his Holocaust experience. The Foreign Ministry of the Swiss government (EDA) supported his activities of commemoration, including co- sponsoring the screening of Susy and Peter Scheiner's film in Welykie Mosty. The film was shown at several film festivals and received a number of endorsements. Further reading *Czarnecki, Jerzy 2002 (2nd edition in 2007). ‚ÄúMein Leben als ‚ÄúArier‚Äù.

It began on 29 May 2020 when a fuel storage tank at Norilsk-Taimyr Energy's Thermal Power Plant No. 3 (owned by Nornickel) failed, flooding local rivers with up to 17,500 tonnes of diesel oil. President Vladimir Putin declared a state of emergency in early June. The incident has been described as the second-largest oil spill in modern Russian history, after the 1994 Komi pipeline spill, where 400,000 tonnes of crude oil were released to the environment between August 1994 and January 1995. Cause AMS, 1964) Diesel oil is used as a backup fuel for the Norilsk-Taimyr Energy (NTEK) which is a coal-fired combined heat and power plant. Fuel storage Tank 5 failed due to holes at the tank bottom, caused by the formation of ulcerative corrosion. In 2014 the company had been ordered by the Russian regulatory agency for natural resources Rostekhnadzor to, by 2015, clean the outer surface of the walls and roof of the tanks from rust and restore the anticorrosion coating, and by October 2016, to conduct non-destructive inspection of the tank bottoms. Despite these requests from the Russian Government, Norilsk-Taimyr Energy did not take the requested steps to avoid a failure of Tank 5. Spread and clean-up Up to 21,000 cubic metres (17,500 tonnes) of diesel oil spilled on to the ground and into local rivers, affecting an immediate area of , the nearby Daldykan River, a tributary of the Ambarnaya River, and contaminating an area of . Clean-up efforts were anticipated to be difficult as there are no roads and the rivers are too shallow for boats and barges. It was estimated the immediate cost of emergency relief activities would be 10 billion roubles (US$146 million), with a total clean-up cost of 100 billion roubles (US$1.5 billion), which would take five to ten years; Norilsk Nickel is to pay the costs., On 4 June 2020 Russian state television reported that the spill had been contained using a series of specially constructed booms on the Ambarnaya river. However, drifting ice broke the booms and the spill reached Lake Pyasino, threatening the Pyasina River,https://interfax.com/newsroom/top-stories/68976/ which flows into the Arctic Ocean. Aftermath President Putin chairing a meeting about the fuel spill on 3 June 2020 Russia's Investigative Committee has launched a criminal investigation of the spill. The head of the power plant's boiler-turbine workshop was placed in pretrial detention, charged with violating environmental regulations and negligence. Yevgeny Zinichev, head of Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry, stated that the power plant did not report the incident for two days, while trying to contain the situation on their own. President Vladimir Putin declared a regional state of emergency following the spill, and criticized the local authorities for a slow response. He also criticized Vladimir Potanin, chairman and major shareholder of Norilsk Nickel, for not properly maintaining the safety of the fuel tanks at the plant. Putin ordered officials to amend Russian law to prevent similar accidents in the future. In a 3 June 2020 televised meeting devoted to disaster management, Putin asked Sergei Lipin, the head of NTEK: \\"Why did government agencies only find out about this two days after the fact? Are we going to learn about emergency situations from social media?\\" After the state environmental agency Rosprirodnadzor told its employee Vasily Ryabinin to stop investigating the disaster, he quit his job on 7 June and went public as a whistleblower. In the aftermath of the Norilsk spill, Russia's Prosecutor General's office ordered safety checks at all dangerous installations built on the permafrost in Russia's Arctic. Greenpeace Russia compared the potential environmental effects of the Norilsk spill to that of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. As a result of this incident, Oleg Deripaska, the founder of Rusal, which in 2019 owned 28% of Nornickel, urged management changes at Nornickel, which is 35% owned by billionaire businessman Vladimir Potanin's Olderfrey Holdings Ltd.Russian Oligarchs Battle Over Nornickel‚Äôs Arctic Oil Spill, Forbes, 14 July 2020 See also * List of oil spills ReferencesExternal links * Category:2020 controversies Category:2020 disasters in Russia Category:2020 in the environment Category:2020 industrial disasters Category:Disasters in Siberia Category:Man-made disasters in Russia Category:May 2020 events in Russia Oil spill Category:Oil spills ","title":"Norilsk oil spill"},{"id":"64179252","text":"The 93rd Massachusetts General Court, consisting of the Massachusetts Senate and the Massachusetts House of Representatives, met in 1872 during the governorship of Republican William B.

Chernihiv hryvnia is a gold medallion belonging to the type of coil amulets (weight approx. 186 g, diameter 7.3 cm).  History  Chernihiv hryvnia was accidentally found in 1821 on the banks of the Bilous River (right tributary of the Desna) near Chernihiv. It is made by wax casting with inscriptions and images additionally carved. The obverse is decorated with the image of the archangel with the inscription \\"Michael\\" (in Old Slavonic) and the text of the prayer \\"Holy, holy, holy...\\" (in Greek). The reverse depicts a woman's head, surrounded by intertwined snakes, with the text: \\"Lord help your servant Vasyl. Amen\\" in Old Ukrainian). The coin, given its high cost, could have belonged to a person of the prince's family. Orthodox Metropolitan Yevgeny Bolkhovitinov linked the Chernihiv hryvnia with Volodymyr Monomakh as the latter had the Christian name Vasyl and he ruled the Chernihiv principality at that time.

The operation was carried out by parts of the combined cavalry brigade under the command of the brigade commander Yakov Arkadevich Melkumov.  Prerequisites  In 1930, the Central Asian Military District command developed a plan to attack the Basmachi bases and destroy their manpower in northern Afghanistan, where active fighters against the Soviet government emigrated from Turkestan in the 1920s and systematically violated the Soviet-Afghan border. In addition, as early as the end of 1929, Soviet intelligence received reliable information from the recently defeated Emir of Afghanistan HabibullƒÅh KalakƒÅni (Bacha-ye Saqao) about the planned tearing away of northern Afghanistan and the formation of a separate state on its territory, headed by Ibrahim Bek. At a meeting of elders in Kunduz in March 1930, the Prime Minister of Afghanistan, Mohammad Hashim Khan, on behalf of the King of Afghanistan, Mohammed Nadir Shah, who had taken power from Habibullah, again demanded that Ibrahim Bek lay down his arms. However, the latter stated: These circumstances to a great extent bothered the Afghan government, and it agreed to force intervention by the USSR in their country.  Campaign  Kurbashi Ibrahim Bek. Before crossing the border at the Aivaj post with the soldiers of the Red Army, explanatory work was carried out on the need for their invasion of the territory of a neighboring state. The purpose of the campaign was explained, and the possibility of causing any damage to the indigenous population of Afghanistan was strictly excluded. The results of the operation were to be ‚Äúour gift‚Äù to the 16th Party Congress. At the end of June 1930, the combined cavalry brigade of the Red Army under the command of the brigade commander Yakov Melkumov (Hakob Melkumyan, known in the Basmachi environment as Yakub Tura), crossed the Amu Darya, entering Afghanistan. Not meeting on its way opposition from the local authorities and the regular Afghan army, the Soviet detachment advanced 50‚Äì70 km inland. The local population, which was clearly dissatisfied with the emigrants (Basmachis and their families), who, in their opinion, occupied the ‚Äúbest lands‚Äù , was friendly towards the Red Army units. Local residents often acted as guides. Unit commanders, in turn, as noted in the report: \\"They strictly controlled that during the operation the fighters did not accidentally‚Äú touch ‚Äùthe farms and property of the indigenous people, and did not affect their national and religious feelings\\". Representatives of the local administration assisted the Soviet detachment when crossing the Khanabad River, as well as in the acquisition of supplies and fodder. Payment for receiving the latter was carried out in a currency convenient for the local population. Upon learning of the Red Army's invasion of Afghanistan, Ibrahim Bek initially wanted to fight, but after specifying the enemy‚Äôs strength, he hastily left for the mountains, while informing the naibul-hukuma (governor-general) of the Qataghan-Badakhshan Province, Mir-Muhammed-Safar Khan, to attack of the Red Army. Safar Khan, in turn, sent a letter to the Soviet commanders on 23 June, reproaching them \\"for a sudden border crossing\\" and urging them to return \\"to their territory\\", but this did not impede the further operation of the latter. The next day, Ibrahim Bek received an order from Safar Khan to \\"join the battle with the Reds\\". However, seeing that the local authorities \\"do not interfere with the Russians\\", the Lokai at the assembled council decided that the Afghans were deliberately trying to push them against the Red Army. Another prominent kurbashi was Utan Bek, who was aware of his agents on the border as well as Ibrahim Bek went to the mountains. As a result of this, units of the Red Army, as noted in the report: \\"did not have to meet organized resistance and they eliminated individual gangs of 30‚Äì40 dzhigits, individual basmachi and their accomplices\\". During the punitive raid, Ak-Tepe (White Hill) and Ali-Abad villages in Kunduz Province were burned and destroyed, except for that part of the village where the native Afghans lived. Also, during the raid for 35 km, all villages and yurts in the river valley were destroyed. Up to 17,000 cartridges were blown up, up to 40 rifles were seized, emigrants' grain stocks were burned, cattle were destroyed and partially stolen. The Soviet detachment took 200 camels, 80 horses and 400 rams with them. The local Afghan population did not leave their yurts and remained untouched. The total losses of the Basmachis and their accomplices amounted to 839 people killed, including the head of the religious sect Pir-Ishan and the ideological inspirers of the Basmachi by the kurbashi Ishan-Palvan and Domullo-Donahan. The losses of the Soviet side amounted to one drowned at the crossing and two wounded.

She was an early member of the Soil Association and she owned the first dairy farm to be recognised as organic. Life Williams was born in \\"Crugiau\\" near Aberystwyth in 1911. She was the middle child of three. Her parents named her Dinah Eiluned Lyon Jones. Her father, Abel Edwin Jones, would become a Professor of agriculture at the University College of Wales,Dinal Williams at the ODNB her Scottish mother, Bessie Jones, was the first instructor of dairy farming at the university. Her father died when she was twelve and the same year she won a milking competition in London. Her mother bought Guernsey cows as well and her mother surprised her peers when she used seaweed as a fertiliser. She and her mother became committed farmers struggling though the 1920s. Their dairy farm was in the Clarach valley near Cardigan and they looked after Guernsey and Ayshire cows. The \\"Nantllan\\" farm delivered the milk that they milked every morning to nearby farms. Their milk was not mixed together as the national Milk Marketing Board proposed and they resisted its new approaches. They were open to new ideas and she was sent to the Ukraine in a group led by Sir John Russell of the Rothamsted agricultural research station. She was impressed by the new ideas but hated the repressive life they led under Stalin. She married in the 1930s and started their own small holding. Her mother decided to retire and passed on the farm to Dinah's brother. After the second world war they moved to a 150 acre farm named \\"Brynllys farm\\". At her farm she farmed naturally without using many chemicals but her outlook had a name after she heard a talk by Lady Eve Balfour in 1952. Balfour's Haughley Experiments and her ideas about sustainable farming in her book \\"The Living Soil\\" had lead to the creation of the Soil Association and Williams would be a member. In 1966 she allowed her daughter, Rachel Roberts, to take over her farm and she would create the organic yoghurt business \\"Rachel's Organic\\".

The case related to a security interest which was created in favour of the bank over the insurance proceeds relating to a ship. The sipo was later involved in a collision, and the third party sought to assert a claim to the insurance proceeds in priority to the bank's rights under the security agreement. The choice of law rules suggested different outcomes depending upon whether this was characterised as an issue of contract law (in which case it would be determined by English law, and the bank would prevail) or an issue of property law (in which case French law would apply, and the third party would prevail). The Court of Appeal held that the choice of law rules relating to contracts should be applied, and accordingly, the bank prevailed. Facts At the centre of the case was a ship by the name of the Mount I. The owners of the Mount I were based in Dubai. The owners of the Mount I (Five Star General Trading LLC) had purchased the vessel with a loan from Raiffeisen Zentralbank √ñsterreich AG, an Austrian bank. The vessel was insured with a French insurance company, but the insurance policy was expressed to be governed by English law. As part of the security for the loan, the bank had taken a mortgage over the vessel and an assignment by way of security of the insurance proceeds.RZB v Five Star, para 3. On there was a collision in the Strait of Malacca between the Mount I and another vessel, the ICL Vikraman. The ICL Vikram sank, with the tragic loss of life of 29 of her crew, and also total loss of her cargo. The ICL Vikram was owned by a group of Taiwanese companies. After the collision of 26th September 1997, the Mount I was arrested in Malaysia by the owners of the ICL Vikraman. She was later sold by order of the Malaysian court. Her sale realised US$3,082,805 which was held by the Malaysian court pending the resolution of the priority dispute between the Austrian bank and the Taiwanese owners of the ICL Vikraman, but those proceeds were insufficient to fully discharge either claim (much less both of them).RZB v Five Star, paras 3 and 8. Both the Austrian bank and the Taiwanese owners of the ICL Vikraman sought to attach the insurance proceeds relating to the Mount I. The Austrian bank claimed it had a first ranking claim to the proceeds because of the perfected security interest over the policies of insurance. The Taiwanese ship owners claimed that they had a first ranking claim because they had obtained orders of attachment in France which was where the insurer was located, and the bank had not.RZB v Five Star, para 3. The English Court of Appeal had to decide which system of laws to apply to the claim. The Austrian bank claimed that as the policy was governed by English law, that law should apply (and the bank would win). The Taiwanese shipowners claimed that this was not a question of contract, but of property, and the insurance proceeds were deemed to be located where the debtor (ie. the insurance company was located) - in France. They argued French law should thus apply, and that as they had first attachment under French law, their claim should prevail.RZB v Five Star, para 19. Judgment Mance LJ =High Court= In the High Court the matter came before Longmore J, who commented in the course of his judgment that it was like \\"being set an examination question on the applicable law\\".RZB v Five Star, para 2. He adjudicated the issue to be one of contract, and held the issue was to be determined by English law (as the chosen governing law of the insurance contract), and so the Austrian bank prevailed.RZB v Five Star, para 18. The Taiwanese shipowners appealed. =Court of Appeal= In the Court of Appeal, Mance LJ gave the only judgment. After reviewing the facts and the decision in th Court, he reiterated that the essential decision that the court had to make was the \\"choice between the proper law of the insurance and the lex situs of the insurance claim.\\"RZB v Five Star, para 25. Choice of law issue He affirmed and restated the general principle set out in . It is a three-stage process involving: (1) characterisation of the relevant issue; (2) selection of the rule of conflict of laws which lays down a connecting factor for that issue; and (3) identification of the system of law which is tied by that connecting factor to that issue. He also reiterated the general principle that the process falls to be undertaken in a broad internationalist spirit in accordance with the principles of conflict of laws of the forum.RZB v Five Star, para 26. (Aldous LJ, who was sitting in this case, was also a member of the Court of Appeal in the Macmillan case.) In an oft-cited passage he noted: > The overall aim is to identify the most appropriate law to govern a > particular issue. The classes or categories of issue which the law > recognises at the first stage are man-made, not natural. They have no > inherent value, beyond their purpose in assisting to select the most > appropriate law. A mechanistic application, without regard to the > consequences, would conflict with the purpose for which they were conceived. > They may require redefinition or modification, or new categories may have to > be recognised accompanied by new rules at stage 2, if this is necessary to > achieve the overall aim of identifying the most appropriate law (cf also > Dicey & Morris on The Conflict of Laws, 13th Ed. paragraph 2-005).RZB v Five > Star, para 27. Mance LJ then noted that the three-stage process cannot therefore be pursued by taking each step \\"in turn and in isolation\\". There is, he held, an element of inter-play or even circularity in the three-stage process. \\"[T]he conflict of laws does not depend (like a game or even an election) upon the application of rigid rules, but upon a search for appropriate principles to meet particular situations.\\"RZB v Five Star, paras 28 and 29. He noted that both England and France were party to the Rome Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations (now superseded by the Rome I Regulation). Article 12 of the Convention provides: > 12.(1) The mutual obligations of assignor and assignee under a voluntary > assignment of a right against another person (\\"the debtor\\") shall be > governed by the law which under this Convention applies to the contract > between assignor and assignee. > (2) The law governing the right to which the assignment relates shall > determine its assignability, the relationship between the assignee and the > debtor, the conditions under which the assignment can be invoked against the > debtor and any question whether the debtor's obligations have been > discharged. He noted that the Guiliano-Lagarde reportReport on the Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations [1980] OJ C282/1 on the Convention clearly indicated that property rights were not included within the Convention. Conversely, he pointed out that \\"contractual rights\\" were to be given an autonomous meaning, taking an internationalist approach, rather than looking at strictly English concepts of contract and property.RZB v Five Star, paras 32 and 33. After reviewing the arguments he held that the wording of the Convention, and in particular the reference to the rights between the assignee and debtor, meant the Convention rules (ie. the choice of law rules for contracts) must apply in preference to the English common law choice of law rules relating to property. He felt fortified in that conclusion by the comments in the Guliano-Lagarde report that \\"The words 'conditions under which the assignment can be invoked' cover the conditions of transferability of the assignment as well as the procedures required to give effect to the assignment in relation to the debtor.\\"RZB v Five Star, paras 43 and 47. Assignment issue Having decided that, the Court then had to adjudicate the type of assignment which the security document created. This related to the declaratory relief sought, and the effect which it would have in the related proceedings in France and Malaysia. Mance LJ noted that \\"[u]nder English law, an assignment may occur in a pot-pourri of three different forms, with variegated terminology.\\"RZB v Five Star, para 58. It can arise at law (either under the Marine Insurance Act 1906, section 50 or the Law of Property Act 1925, section 136(1)), or it can arise in equity. After carefully reviewing the document he held: > On that basis, I consider that there was an assignment of the benefit of any > claims under the policy, including collision liability claims. Further, > although such assignment cannot in my judgment have taken effect under > either s.50 or s.136, there is no reason why it did not take effect in > equity.RZB v Five Star, para 80. Reception Commentary on the decision has been largely position. Alongside Macmillan v Bishopsgate it is now treated as the authoritative process for the process for charactersiation of issues in relation to choice of law. * Dicey Morris & Collins cites the case extensivelyAt paragraphs 2-038, 4-021, 12-090, 24-059, 24-061, 30-082, 32-016 and 34-016 (15th edition). for a variety of propositions. These include the propositions that: ** where a \\"rule of substantive law should not be regarded as falling within either of the two potentially applicable conflict rules ... a new conflict rule should be created\\". ** \\"the contract of assignment will determine the availability of any remedy which the assignee may have against the assignor for breach of contract\\". ** that \\"the expression ‚Äúcontractual obligations‚Äù is to be given an autonomous interpretation\\" under the Rome I Regulation. * Cheshire North & Fawcett cites the decision as authoritative in relation to a number of propositions, including the need to take an \\"internationalist approach\\" to characterisation,, characterisation of security assignments as contractual rather than proprietary, , and for the proposition that \\"there is no appropriate conflicts rule that can cover the substantive rule a new conflict rule should be created\\". * Clarkson & Hill make particular reference to the obiter dictum in the judgment relating to the call for flexibility in relation to approach in identifying the appropriate choice of law rule.

The unrest was the result of shortage of sugar. Background During World War I, rationing was introduced, and food distribution was often delayed. In early November 1916, Novonikolayevsk received a shipment of sugar. Then an announcement was made that sugar will be issued from November 9 (3 pounds per person). But it soon became known that half of the products belong to cooperatives. Then the city government made an announcement in the press that sugar distribution is off. Riot On 9 November a crowd of women began to gather in front of the food store of the city government, which was located at Bazarnaya Square. The Novonikolayevsk Police led by the police chief G. P. Bukhartovsky dispersed the crowd. However, soon the crowd began to gather again. According to the Governor, protesters returned thanks to incitement by new recruits and two lower ranks who returned only recently from the battlefields. Then, to suppress the crowd, military reinforcements of 25 people arrived under the command of staff captain Nikitin. After some time, Bukhartovsky was injured by several stones. He requested Nikitin to take the necessary measures to quell the riot and left the place of protests. Then, several warning shots were fired, but it didn't scare the protesters. People went towards the store of the Siberian Partnership, smashed the window panes and entered into the store, where they began robbing products. However, police and soldiers were able to prevent further looting of the shop. During the defense of the Siberian Partnership, Nikitin was injured by a rock to the head after which he transferred command to the ensign and left Bazarnaya Square. Some time later, the number of rioters increases to several thousands. Reinforcements arrived from the local military team, led by Lt. Col. Nekrasov, but, despite the assistance, the crowd swept away the defense, broke the doors and windows of the store and began to rob sugar. Then Nekrasov ordered to shoot at protesters, as a result of which one woman died and five people were injured (of which one woman died in the hospital later). After some time, four training teams of 250 people led by Lieutenant General Kotsurik arrive and drive back the crowd, but the protesters continued to rob other retail outlets of private entrepreneurs, as well as the shops of the Ekonomia Consumer Society. Damage During the riot, 400 pounds of sugar were stolen. The damage from the mass robbery of the Siberian Partnership amounted to 10,000 rubles.  Judicial proceedings  After the riots, 74 people were detained, 54 of them were women. 23 people were taken into custody and sentenced by the Omsk Judicial Chamber to various prison terms.

He is a former member of Magi and Danny & Dusty, and has recorded as a solo artist. In his solo work, Stevens has incorporated elements of folk rock, country, psychedelia and garage rock into his music, and has released what music reviewer Stewart Lee calls \\"fascinatingly different solo albums.\\" Stevens was based in Los Angeles in the 1980s, but now lives in Indiana. Early life Stevens was born and raised in Elkhart, Indiana and started playing music at age nine in various garage and hard rock bands in the 1960s and 1970s. Classically trained, he received scholarship offers from several universities to study double bass, but turned them all down, as he wanted to play rock music. \\"The thought of either playing in a symphony orchestra or teaching music in a high school did not appeal,\\" he said. CareerMagi= In 1975, after graduating from high school, Stevens joined Indiana hard rock band Magi, who released their sole album Win or Lose in 1976. It was recorded in August 1976 at Uncle Dirty's Sound Machine Studios in Kalamazoo, Michigan and co-produced by the band and Bryce \\"Uncle Dirty\\" Roberson, a former session guitarist with Chess Records. The self-financed album was released with no major distribution in a limited edition of 1,000 copies, and the band toured Indiana, Michigan and Illinois in the late 1970s. \\"We were very, very popular in those areas, drawing big crowds everywhere we played. To this day more people in Northern Indiana know Magi than the Long Ryders,\\" Stevens said in 2004. Trying to attract music industry interest, the band relocated to Los Angeles in 1979. However, with their style of hard rock being out of fashion in Los Angeles at the time, the band unsuccessfully tried to adapt to a scene dominated by punk and new wave. Lack of success led to the band slowly falling apart in 1980. Magi reunited for a one-off show in August 1994 at the Elkhart County Fairgrounds and again in March 2011 in Nappanee, Indiana for a benefit concert. =Early solo work= As Magi was dissolving, Stevens began looking for bands and session work in Los Angeles. He found several bands, but \\"none that I felt were worth my time,\\" he said. The only session work he found was for \\"some disco singer that was doing an update on \\"Sealed with a Kiss.\\" During this period, in between working shifts at the Tower Records music store on the Sunset Strip, Stevens seriously began writing songs and played his first solo acoustic gig in December 1980 at the Troubadour in Hollywood. In November 1981, Stevens recorded a demo with Sunny Paul, then a co-worker at Tower Records and a former touring guitarist for R&B; singer Geno Washington. The four-track recordings were recorded and mixed by Paul, who also played drums on the tracks. The demo lead to a deal with Los Angeles independent record label Pulse Records. Stevens then enlisted the help of drummer Mark Cuff of the Textones and bassist Johnny Bethesda of Rubber City Rebels and, with Stevens on guitar and vocals, they recorded six songs at Perspective Studios in Los Angeles on September 29, 1982. The result was the Points of View EP, which was engineered by Thom Wilson and with production credited to Stevens. The instrumentation was deliberately spare, with only one guitar, bass, drums and vocals. In a retrospective review in 1998, Q magazine called the EP \\"serviceable melodic power pop\\" with \\"insipid production\\" that makes the songs \\"jangle along too politely.\\" While Stevens later said that the EP was a good start of trying to make a different style for himself, he felt that the production was weak: \\"I‚Äôm credited, but I really had no control ... and the mastering was terrible. Still, there was and is a demand for that record,\\" he said in 2004. \\"The label owners were very keen on having Rodney Bingenheimer give it a good push on his KROQ radio show, but Rodney said it was a folk album and declined to play it - Rodney was playing hard-core punk at the time. I think the label thought this would be a big cash cow for them, and it wasn‚Äôt, although it did sell steadily,\\" Stevens said. Points of View received decent reviews at the time of its release and sold its 1,000 pressing in a couple of years. =The Long Ryders= By 1983, Stevens had left his day job at Tower Records for another job at Sounds Good Imports in Santa Monica. He recounted in 2004 that one of his co-workers \\"brought a pre-release cassette of his old roommate's band, which was 10-5-60 by the Long Ryders, and played it a lot while we were working. I was impressed with that EP and wound up buying it.\\" A few months later, around Christmas time, that same co-worker revealed to Stevens that the Long Ryders had just fired their bass player. \\"Without missing a beat, I said, \\"hell, I'll play bass for them,\\" Stevens remembered. Soon after, mutual friends phoned up Long Ryder guitarist Sid Griffin, recommending Stevens for the job. \\"I didn't even have to formally audition. The Long Ryders had gigs coming up in the San Francisco area and needed someone quickly,\\" he said. Stevens officially joined the Los Angeles- based Long Ryders in January 1984, recording three studio albums with the band between 1984-1987, all featuring Stevens-penned songs. The Long Ryders were originally associated with the Los Angeles Paisley Underground movement of the 1980s, but unlike other bands of the genre, psychedelic rock played only a small role in their music. Instead, the band were more influenced by the roots rock approach of folk and country rock bands like the Byrds, the Flying Burrito Brothers, and Buffalo Springfield. According to the Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, the Long Ryders \\"blended punk attitude with late 1960s country rock instrumentation and became one of the principal exponents of mid-1980s cowpunk.\\" They toured North America and Europe several times as well as reaching the charts in the UK and earning a large cult following in the US while doing well on college radio. The band broke up in 1987 after failing to break through into the mainstream and would later turn out to be an influence on the alternative country movement that would surface in the 1990s. Their 1984 debut album Native Sons received strong reviews, and did especially well in the UK, where the band's take on American musical traditions went down well with critics. The album was called \\"a modern American classic\\" by British music magazine the Melody Maker and established the band's diverse blend of folk rock, punk and country rock influences. Island Records signed the band in 1985 for their first major label album, 1985's State of Our Union, and the band soon found themselves more popular in Europe than in the US. In 1987, following the release of their third album Two-Fisted Tales, the lack of commercial success and label support began to take its toll on the band. Disillusioned by the band's relentless touring schedule and lack of money, Stevens left the Long Ryders in June 1987 to devote time to his young family and to find another source of income. In 1988, he moved back to Indiana. The Long Ryders, including Stevens, have since 2004 occasionally reunited and released their first studio album in 32 years, Psychedelic Country Soul, in 2019. =Danny & Dusty= Along with other members of the Long Ryders, the Dream Syndicate and Green on Red, Stevens recorded the Danny & Dusty album, The Lost Weekend in 1985. It featured songs written by Dan Stuart (Danny) from Green on Red and Steve Wynn (Dusty) from the Dream Syndicate and was recorded in a single 32 hours recording session in February 1985 at Control Center Studios in Los Angeles. Backing up Stuart and Wynn, besides Stevens on bass, were guitarists Sid Griffin and Stephen McCarthy from the Long Ryders, keyboardist Chris Cacavas from Green on Red, and drummer Dennis Duck from the Dream Syndicate. The Lost Weekend appeared on many year-end top 10 lists, including the New York Times'. After the album's release, the seven-piece band played only a few shows in Los Angeles. In 2007, Danny & Dusty released a second album, Cast Iron Soul, without Stevens' involvement. =Collaborations, live and session work= Stevens supported former Byrd Gene Clark on a few of Clark's last live Los Angeles performances with former Textones vocalist Carla Olson. In March 1987, between Long Ryders tours, Stevens was asked to play standup bass for a Clark and Olson gig at At My Place in Santa Monica. Together with Dwight Yoakam, pianist Skip Edwards and drummer Michael Huey they performed material from Clark and Olson's then-current album So Rebellious a Lover. A year later, Stevens was asked once again to perform with Clark and Olson at Club Lingerie in Hollywood. Performing with Clark \\"was an honor I cherish to this day,\\" Stevens said in 1996. In the late 1980s, Stevens played with Chris Cacavas in his band Junk Yard Love and contributed bass and backing vocals on two tracks on their 1989 album Chris Cacavas and Junk Yard Love. He also produced Green on Red bassist Jack Waterson's 1989 solo album Whose Dog?, as well as playing bass, lead guitar and singing backing vocals. Since 2014, Stevens has recorded with psychedelic garage band Donovan's Brain, a recording collective with a revolving lineup that includes founder Ron Sanchez, Ric Parnell (Atomic Rooster, Spinal Tap) and Bobby Sutliff (the Windbreakers). =Later solo work= Stevens' first full-length solo release, the cassette-only Last Night, was released by California indie label Devil in the Woods in 1992 . It featured new songs as well as rerecordings of unused Long Ryders material such as \\"17 Ways\\", \\"The Upper Hand\\" and \\"Sad Sad Songs\\". Two tracks were produced by Jack Waterson and recorded at Larry's Pro Sound in California in 1988 with Chris Cacavas on bass and organ and Jim McGrath on drums. The rest of the recordings were produced by Stevens and recorded at Allen Recording Studio in Indiana in 1989. Musicians included studio owner Scott Allen on drums, violinist Gretchen Priest and former Magi-guitarist Larry Stutzman. Stevens handled bass and most of the guitar duties. \\"[Scott Allen], as his time allowed, let me use his studio to slowly finish it. By slowly, I mean excruciatingly so,\\" Stevens said in 1996. \\"Nearly two years passed before Last Night could be completed, and then cassettes with rough mixes that were screwed up but powerful sounding were the result. I also had a few polite, clean mixes but they were not nearly as involving.\\" His second album, Another Room, was produced by Waterson at the Root Canal in Hollywood in early 1993. The album was originally slated to be released on German label Doggybag Records and distributed by Sony Germany, but complications delayed its release for two years when Doggybag went bankrupt. It was eventually released in October 1995 on Ohio-based Maia Records. The only two musicians featured on the album are Stevens (vocals, guitar, bass) and Jet Redd (drums). \\"Howard Hilliard II\\" is credited with bass duty, but is actually a pseudonym for Stevens. Waterson, Melisa Malvin and John Thoman of the Rain Parade supply backing vocals on three tracks. The album was well received by fans and critics alike. Bucketfull of Brains magazine called it \\"a splendid piece of Americana\\" and \\"a typical example of the hidden gems on the bi-ways of American music.\\" Relix magazine described it as an \\"unpretentious rootsy pop- rock adventure\\" with an \\"abundance of hook-filled songs that [Stevens] laces liberally with folk, country and rock influences\\". 1997 saw the release of Points Revisited (Maia Records), a collection of Stevens' solo recordings from 1981-1989. \\"After my solo CD Another Room came out, people were writing to the label asking for a Points of View reissue. I instead put out Points Revisited, which contained some Points of View tracks, but substituted demos for some other PoV tracks that I thought told the story better,\\" Stevens said. The compilation contains three tracks from the original EP, three alternate demo versions, the entire Last Night album (with one track in an alternate version), and two home demos. It received four-star reviews from AllMusic and Q magazine, and Goldmine called it \\"unfailingly melodic and memorable\\" and rivaling \\"anything that the Long Ryders ever laid down\\". In 1999, Stevens contributed his version of \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\" to the Neil Young tribute album This Note's for You Too! A Tribute to Neil Young. All proceeds from sales went directly to benefit Neil and Pegi Young's Bridge School foundation, and the album included artists such as the Bevis Frond, Lee Ranaldo, the Coal Porters, Richard Lloyd, Steve Wynn, and the Walkabouts. Stevens had recorded the song, along with several originals, in March 1997 at Doug Harsch's Raw Pop Studios in Indiana with Steve Gee on drums and Harsch on backing vocals. Stevens' proper third album, Home, was recorded in his new home basement studio in Indiana and released in 2007 by Avebury Records, a label founded by Wednesday Week drummer Kelly Callan. The self-produced and mostly self-recorded album features guest appearances by Sarah Stevens on violin and vocals, and \\"Uncle John\\" Potthast on banjo and guitar on a few tracks. The album was inspired by his family's move to a new house in 2003, where he set up his studio to record musical ideas. \\"Having a full recording setup inspired me to complete many songs I had in various stages of assembly, and also write new ones as I settled in with my new environment,\\" Stevens said. Most of the songs were written or completed between 2003 and 2005, with a few taken from earlier songwriting periods. Bucketfull of Brains described the music as a \\"paisley potpourri\\" of \\"LA folk-pop, psychedelia, and a little bit of country\\" and called the album \\"a stone classic.\\" In a four-star review on AllMusic, music critic Jack Rabid felt that there wasn't \\"one under- considered, underplayed, or under-written second\\" on the album. On their Best Albums of 2007 list, the Popnarcotic website called it an \\"absolutely breathtaking album\\", noting that Stevens \\"seems to be able to find his muse where Gram Parsons, Lou Reed, and Alex Chilton all hang out to shoot the breeze.\\" Stevens also self-released two six-song EPs, Workology and Sooner. 2001's Workology was recorded at the same March 1997 sessions as \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\" and contains early versions of songs that would later end up on Home and Sooner. Released in November 2009 through iTunes, Sooner contains new and old songs that Stevens has written and recorded over the years but never released before, as well as a rerecording of the Long Ryders era song \\"How Do We Feel What‚Äôs Real?\\" and a cover of the Only Ones' \\"Curtains for You\\". Both EPs were also available as limited CD-Rs through Stevens‚Äô website. To celebrate its 35th anniversary in 2010, German record label Bear Family Records asked musicians and songwriters to write and record \\"bear\\" songs for the compilation album 35!!! Years - Bear Family Records. They asked Stevens to contribute a song and he wrote \\"Bear in the Woods\\" for the occasion. In 2017, the Long Ryders recorded their own version of the song as their first new studio recording in 30 years and released it as a digital download single. In September 2012, Stevens recorded the song \\"Bitter Fruit\\" for the 2013 benefit album Skrang: Sounds Like Bobby Sutliff. Sutliff, a former Devil in the Woods labelmate, had been in a near-fatal car accident and to help him financially, friends and colleagues offered to record tracks. The album contains 18 Sutliff songs performed by members of Rain Parade, True West, the dBs, and Wilco among others. Other career In the 1990s, Stevens received a degree in computer science and worked for many years with computer and networking technologies alongside music.

More than 38,000 people were detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the time of the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States. ICE's response to the outbreak in detention facilities has been widely characterized as substandard and dangerous. Harmful practices have been reported in numerous facilities managed by third-party private contractors with ICE. For example, reports found that HDQ Neutral disinfectant was used over 50 times per day in un-ventilated areas, which caused pain, bleeding, and severe illness to numerous people held in Adelanto Detention Center, a private prison managed by GEO Group Inc. ICE and the Trump administration have been heavily criticized for its lack of transparency during the COVID-19 pandemic, after it banned oversight tours by U.S. Congress and stakeholder groups at all detention facilities and further restricted attorney access. Detained people have reported that they are being forced into unsafe, unsanitary, and harmful conditions. People who are critically ill have been denied testing and medical attention by detention officers. Serious irregularities in ICE's testing data have been reported, while ICE has blocked coronavirus testing information at its facilities from being released to the public. The American Civil Liberties Union referred to the COVID-19 pandemic in US immigration detention as \\"an unquestionable public health disaster.\\"  Conditions  The conditions of immigration detention facilities in the United States have been identified as contributing to the spread of COVID-19. Sources recognized that ICE (1) provided \\"dangerously substandard\\" medical care, (2) lacked transparency, accountability, and oversight, (3) engaged in frequent transfers of detainees between facilities, and (4) had crowded housing with a lack basic access to soap or masks. ICE's notoriously poor handling of previous outbreaks in their facilities, such as a 2018 mumps outbreak, which began with fives cases at two Texas detention facilities before spreading to 57 facilities in 19 states, have been cited as a proven track record. A study in the Journal of Urban Health projected that 72 percent of those in immigration detention would be infected with the coronavirus 90 days after a detention center had five infected cases as an optimistic projection, and that about 100 percent of the population would be infected as a pessimistic projection.  Deaths  Sources report that ICE may not be accurately reporting infections or deaths from COVID-19, citing ICE's handling of previous outbreaks. Two deaths have been reported. * On May 6, the death of Carlos Ernesto Escobar Mej√≠a, a 57-year-old Salvadoran man, was widely reported. Escobar Mejia was the first immigrant to die from COVID-19 in the custody of ICE and the 11th immigrant to die in government custody in the fiscal year. Escobar Mej√≠a was denied bond on April 15, when he was \\"still well,\\" by immigration judge Lee O'Connor, which is credited as resulting in his death. Senator Dianne Feinstein called for a federal investigation into the conditions at Otay Mesa prison, managed by CoreCivic, a private prison corporation, where Escobar Mej√≠a had been detained. ICE and the United States Department of Homeland Security were criticized for their actions and an investigation was called regarding Escobar Mejia's death. * On May 24, Santiago Baten-Oxlaj, a 34-year-old man from Guatemala died at Piedmont Regional Hospital after being transferred from the Stewart Detention Center, a private prison run also run by CoreCivic under contract with ICE. Baten-Oxlaj had been granted a voluntary departure to Guatemala, and was awaiting departure from the United States at the time of his death. His death prompted human rights groups to call for the release of all people detained by ICE.  Timeline  March = In March, ICE reportedly began to assess \\"vulnerable\\" detainees, including those over 60 or pregnant. However, at the end of March it was reported that \\"the agency has not changed its detention practices in response to the pandemic.\\" On March 31, a federal judge ordered the immediate release of ten chronically ill immigrants in government custody, saying that it would be ‚Äúunconscionable and possibly barbaric‚Äù to keep them detained. U.S. district Judge John E. Jones III agreed with activist demands, stating that conditions in US immigration detention facilities, in which people \\"are unable to keep socially distant while detained by ICE and cannot keep the detention facilities sufficiently clean to combat the spread of the virus\\" will cause ‚Äúa very real risk of serious, lasting illness or death.\\" At this time, ICE had already found that four immigrants in New Jersey jails had tested positive for COVID-19. = April = On April 9, detained men and women at the Irwin County Detention Center, in south Georgia, began organizing a protest to raise awareness of the harmful conditions they were being forcefully kept under as the threat of COVID-19 spread throughout ICE detention facilities. Between February 3 and April 24, 2020, ICE carried out 232 deportation flights to Latin America and Caribbean countries, which contributed to the spread of COVID-19. In an article published in The Washington Post, it was reported that the US was \\"sending infected migrants back to vulnerable countries,\\" including Mexico, Haiti, El Salvador, and Guatemala. It was later confirmed that some of these migrants had tested positive. In Mexico, an outbreak at a shelter in Tamaulipas was linked to a migrant whom the US had deported. Dozens of migrants tested positive for the virus after being deported to Guatemala. = May = On May 16, federal judges ordered the release of nearly 400 ICE detainees, \\"citing the preexisting medical conditions of the immigrants released and the potential for life-threatening complications from COVID-19.\\" U.S. representatives Carolyn Maloney and Jamie Raskin noted that \\"despite our repeated attempts to secure information, ICE has failed to fully respond to our requests, casting serious doubt on its preparedness for this crisis.\\" ICE reportedly released an additional 900 people detained in US immigration detention facilities. 1,201 people in US immigration detention had tested positive for COVID-19 out of 2,394 who have been tested at this time. On May 19, the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs inspector general launched an investigation into ICE‚Äôs handling of the coronavirus pandemic. On May 21, a complaint was filed at Adelanto Detention Center after \\"a slew of interviews with inmates describing the poor conditions in the facility.\\" Several accounts reported that guards were \\"spraying HDQ Neutral every 15 to 20 minutes all over communal areas with devastating consequences on those imprisoned.\\" Manufacturer of the toxic chemical Spartan Chemical warns that HDQ Neutral \\"can cause skin burns and serious eye damage when inhaled.\\" The chemical was sprayed by GEO Group Inc., who manages the facility under ICE contract, in un- ventilated areas every 15‚Äì20 minutes. One detainee stated: \\"When I blow my nose, blood comes out. They are treating us like animals. One person fainted and was taken out, I don't know what happened to them. There is no fresh air.\\" Since May 11, at least nine inmates had fallen seriously ill because of the spraying. There was widespread outrage by activists, such as the media advocacy strategist at Freedom for Immigrants, who stated, \\"to us, this is an apparent act of retaliation for publicly reporting that GEO staff was previously only cleaning with water.\\" On May 22, the Bluebonnet Detention Center in rural West Texas, just five months after opening following the establishment of a lucrative agreement between local officials and ICE, became the site of one of the biggest outbreaks among immigration detention facilities in the country. The facility, run by a for-profit prison contractor, had approximately 111 confirmed cases, more than a quarter of the total population, which was the second-highest among immigration detention facilities at the time. The larger Otay Mesa Detention Center had the highest number of cases, with 155 as of May 22. Legal fellow at the Texas Civil Rights Project Carrie O‚ÄôConnor commented: ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing is the number of detainees testing positive in Texas and across the country is exploding. The government is slow-walking their response. That slow walk is illegal and it‚Äôs putting everybody at risk.‚Äù As of May 30, only 3,113 people in ICE detention had been tested‚Äìabout ten percent of the total population. More than 1 in 5 immigrants, or 78 of the 379 immigrants held at the Houston Contract Detention Facility, had tested positive and the rate of infection had nearly tripled in the facility, up from 21 people the previous week. = June = On June 1, more than 1,406 immigration detainees had tested positive for the coronavirus, according to ICE. It was reported that the number of cases was \\"much higher given the relatively low number that ICE has reported testing ‚Äì fewer than 12 percent of detainees.\\" On June 3, three detained people provided live, first- hand details of their time in a South Florida immigration detainment facility to U.S. District Court Judge Marcia G. Cooke virtually, while in the presence of an unmasked guard. One of the individuals was Deivys Perez Valladares, a diabetic 25-year-old Cuban national, who revealed that \\"the ICE official who is here with me, he doesn‚Äôt have a mask on.‚Äù When asked, Valladares revealed that the official was standing less than six feet away from him: \\"Much less. We‚Äôre super close, like two or three feet.‚Äù Valladares also \\"recounted to the court how he was transferred to and from three different detention centers within a week, and in one instance placed in a cramped 'hielera'‚ÄîSpanish for icebox‚Äîfor 13 hours with 17 other detainees.\\" Icebox is a nickname detainees assign to \\"the frigid, cramped holding cells they are placed in prior to a transfer.\\" ICE did not refute Valladares‚Äô claims. Steve Cooper, a Jamaican national, and Alejandro Ferrera Borges, a Cuban national, also testified. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment formally listed that an outbreak had occurred at a north Aurora immigration detention center managed by GEO Group Inc. On June 4, The Human Rights Watch called for the United States to suspend deportations immediately in order to cease contributing to the spread of COVID-19 globally. Nicole Austin-Hillery, US program director at Human Rights Watch, stated: ‚ÄúDespite outbreaks of Covid-19 in US immigration detention centers and government travel restrictions the world over, the US has continued deportations with little regard for the consequences. With these reckless deportations, the Trump administration is contributing to the spread of Covid-19 and endangering public health globally.‚Äù The same day, it was announced that new detainees booked into one of twenty-two immigration detention facilities managed by ICE's in-house medical provider Health Services Corps. would begin being tested for coronavirus, after a reported surge in cases. However, despite the spread of COVID-19 in US immigration detention facilities, the 200 other facilities operated by third-party contractors have not begun testing detainees at intake. An influx of COVID-19 cases were reported At the Otero County Processing Center, with 92 total. An interview was denied by ICE. The nearby Otero County Prison Facility, a non- ICE facility, also reported a surge in cases and one death. The first confirmed case at Imperial Regional Detention Center in Calexico, a 22-year- old Bangladeshi national, was reported. People detained in the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center in Bakersfield, California held a hunger strike in protest of the killing of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Oscar Grant, and Tony McDade, the deaths of \\"Carlos Mejia, who died in ICE custody at Otay Mesa, and Choung Woong Ahn, our friend who died in ICE custody at this detention center,\\" and the harmful conditions presented by the COVID-19 pandemic in US immigration detention. By mid-June, cases were reportedly unable to be contained at the Eloy Detention Center in Arizona, as cases soared in the state. Marisol Mendoza, a diabetic immigrant in ICE custody at the Eloy Detention Center sued ICE and CoreCivic for her release. Mendoza was denied and instead a federal judge ordered ICE to improve her conditions and make them constitutional. This was not followed by ICE and within two weeks Mendoza tested positive for COVID-19. = July = References  Category:COVID-19 pandemic in the United States Category:Immigration detention centers and prisons in the United States Category:Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States Category:Prison healthcare ","title":"COVID-19 pandemic in US immigration detention"},{"id":"64180034","text":"Bjerk is a surname.

The Savyolovsky suburban railway line connects Moscow with the stations in the north, in particular, with the towns of Dolgoprudny, Lobnya, Yakhroma, Dmitrov, Taldom, Dubna, and Kimry. The stations the line serves are located in Moscow, as well as in Dolgoprudny, Lobnya, Mytishchi, Dmitrov, Dubna, and Taldom in Moscow Oblast, and in Kimrsky District of Tver Oblast. Some of the suburban trains have their southern terminus at Moscow Savyolovsky railway station in Moscow, others commute from the Belorussky suburban railway line. In the northern direction, the suburban trains terminate at Lobnya, Aeroport Sheremetyevo, Iksha, Dmitrov, Verbilki, Dubna, Taldom, and Savyolovo. The suburban railway line is served by the Moscow Railway. The tracks between Moscow Savyolovsky railway station and Lobnya are also used by Line D1, one of the Moscow Central Diameters, and by the service to Sheremetyevo International Airport, provided by Aeroexpress. A section between Iksha and Yahroma is also used by the Greater Ring of the Moscow Railway. The suburban railway line follows the railway which connects Moscow with Rybinsk and Vesyegonsk. It is electrified between Moscow and Savyolovo. Between Moscow and Dmitrov, there are two tracks, north of Dmitrov there is one track. The distance between Savyolovsky railway station and Savyolovo is . History The concession to build a railway between Moscow and Savyolovo was given in 1897 to the Second Society of Connecting Lines. The Society of Moscow ‚Äî Yaroslavl ‚Äî Arkhangelsk Railway viewed this as competition, protested, and indeed got the concession, by promising to open an extra passenger station and a cargo station in Moscow (currently Moscow Savyolovsky railway station). The construction started in 1898, and it turned out the there are insuffucnent supplies of stone in the construction areas. The stone had to be transported from the areas south of Moscow, which made the construction more expensive than it was originally planned. On February 1900, trial traffic started, and in January 1901 the section between Beskudnikovo and Savyolovo was opened. The railway only had one track. In 1900, a railway line connecting Beskudnikovo and Losinoostrovskaya was constructed. This was done in order to facilitate the railway traffic between Moscow and Savyolovo, since Moscow Savyolovsky railway station was not open yet. After a tram line from central line to Medvedkovo was built, in 1966 a direct connection to Losinoostrovskaya was discontinued, and the whole railway line between Beskudnikovo and Losinoostrovskaya was demolished in 1987. In 1902, Moscow Savyolovsky railway station was opened, and traffic was rerouted there. The second track between Moscow and Dmitrov was constructed between 1932 and 1934. The line from Verbilki to Bolshaya Volga was constructed in the 1930s to serve the construction of the Moscow Canal, since the construction headquarters were in Bolshaya Volga. The line was demolished during World War II and restored in the 1940s, in the 1970s it was extended to Dubna. In 1954, the section between Moscow and Iksha was electrified. In 1955, the electrification was extended to Dmitrov, in the 1970s to Dubna, and in 1978 to Savyolovo. The tracks between Savyolovo and Kalyazin remain not electrified. On 21 November 2019, Moscow Central Diameters started operation.

Nos. 203335, et al.) is a landmark ruling of the Supreme Court of the Philippines handed down on February 18, 2014. When the Congress of the Philippines passed the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 the bill was immediately controversial, especially its strict penalties for the new crime of \\"cyberlibel\\", an upgraded form of the already existing criminal libel charge found in the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines. In the end, the Court declared that most of the law, including the cyberlibel provision, was constitutional. The ruling's abridgement of free expression has been widely criticized, including by Harry Roque, President Duterte's spokesman. The decision reached in Disini paved the way for the anti-fake news provisions of the Bayanihan Act.  Petition  Several petitions were almost immediately submitted to the Supreme Court questioning the constitutionality of the Act upon its signing, including the petition of Jose Jesus M. Disini, Jr. on September 25, a Harvard-educated lawyer and law professor at the University of the Philippines College of Law from whose name the title of the case derives.  Initial deferment and protests  On October 2, the Supreme Court initially chose to defer action on the petitions, citing an absence of justices which prevented the Court from sitting en banc. The initial lack of a temporary restraining order meant that the law went into effect as scheduled on October 3. In protest, Filipino netizens reacted by blacking out their Facebook profile pictures and trending the hashtag #NoToCybercrimeLaw on Twitter. \\"Anonymous\\" also defaced government websites, including those of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System and the Intellectual Property Office.  Temporary restraining order  On October 8, 2012, the Supreme Court decided to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO), pausing implementation of the law for 120 days. In early December 2012, the government requested the lifting of the TRO, which was denied. The TRO consolidated all fifteen petitions filed up to that point into one case.  Oral arguments  Over four hours of oral arguments by petitioners were heard on January 15, 2013, followed by a three-hour rebuttal by the Office of the Solicitor General, representing the government, on January 29, 2013. This was the first time in Philippine history that oral arguments were uploaded online by the Supreme Court.  Ruling  On February 18, 2014, in a ruling penned by justice Roberto Abad, the Supreme Court ruled 12‚Äì1‚Äì2 that most of the law was constitutional, although it struck down other provisions, including the ones that violated double jeopardy.Disini v. Secretary of Justice, G.R. Nos. 203335, et al. (Supreme Court of the Philippines ) In total, ¬ß4(c)(3), ¬ß5 (only in relation to ¬ß4(c)(2), ¬ß4(c)(3), and ¬ß4(c)(4)), ¬ß7 (only in relation to sections ¬ß4(c)(2) and ¬ß4(c)(4)), ¬ß12, and ¬ß19 were struck down by the Court as unconstitutional. Notably, \\"likes\\" and \\"retweets\\" of libelous content, originally themselves also criminalized as libel under the law, were found to be legal, and this was the only instance in which the court modified the interpretation of section 4(c)(4). Only justice Marvic Leonen dissented from the ruling, writing that he believes the whole idea of criminal libel to be unconstitutional, and assailing the Court for not finding so.Disini v. Secretary of Justice, Opinion dissenting in part and concurring in part by Leonen, J. Of note also was the Court's justification for the higher penalties given to cybercrimes, such as prisi√≥n mayor (six to twelve years in prison) for cyberlibel: > There exists a substantial distinction between crimes committed through the > use of information and communications technology and similar crimes > committed using other means. In using the technology in question, the > offender often evades identification and is able to reach far more victims > or cause greater harm. The distinction, therefore, creates a basis for > higher penalties for cybercrimes. The Court's ruling also puts the burden of proof for whether or not there was malice on the defendant rather than the petitioner, even if the petitioner is a public figure. In his dissent in part, justice Antonio Carpio called this provision \\"clearly repugnant to the Constitution.\\"Disini v. Secretary of Justice, Opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part by Carpio, J. = Motion for reconsideration = While motions for reconsideration were immediately filed by numerous petitioners, including the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility, they were all rejected with finality on April 22, 2014.Disini v.

The principal focus of his scholarship and teaching was on Roman law. He became a member of a number of learned societies. In addition, between 1958 and 1992 he was awarded honorary doctorates by no fewer than ten different universities on three different continents. An eleventh honorary doctorate, from the Jurisprudence faculty at the University of Regensburg, was awarded only posthumously, however, in 1999). Max Kaser is respected as the author of pioneering writings on the step by step progression from classical legal concepts to modern European civil law. His text books on Roman civil law and modern civil procedure (for many purposes outside Anglo-American common law precepts) break new ground in presenting the historical evolution of legal concepts and principals, incorporating analyses and commentaries on written sources, and using research techniques that he himself (with others) developed.  Life  Max Kaser was born in Vienna where his father, the historian Dr. Kurt Kaser (1870‚Äì1931) worked at the time as a university tutor (\\"Privatdozent\\"). On both his father's side and his mother's sides, his ancestral roots tracked back through many generations of Austrian government administrators, lawyers, physicians, army officers and artists. Soon after his birth his father accepted an appointment which included an extraordinary professorship at the University of Graz, and the family relocated to that city. In 1914 the family moved again when Dr.Kurt Kaser accepted a full professorship at the University of Czernowitz (as it was then known), a couple of hundred kilometers south-west of Kiev. The First World War and, more indirectly, its aftermath, brought about the need for further moves, and during the second part of his boyhood Max Kaser's family moved repeatedly between Czernowitz, Salzburg and Graz, as his father pursued his career as a university professor of medieval and modern history. In 1924 Max Kaser enrolled at the University of Graz where between 1924 and 1928 he studied Jurisprudence. He was taught by Artur Steinwenter who taught Roman law, and whom Kaser would always single out as a powerfully positive influence, on account of his \\"extensive knowledge and exceptionally well-balanced judgement\\". The two would remain firm friends till Steinwenter's death in 1959. A student contemporary at Graz was Walter Wilburg who later achieved eminence as a legal scholar and lawyer, and who also became a life-long friend. He received his doctorate at Graz, awarded on 19 November 1928. Many years earlier Ludwig Kaser (1841‚Äì1916), his grandfather, had also received a doctorate in Jurisprudence from the University of Graz. It was on the recommendation of his doctoral supervisor, Steinwenter, that Max Kaser switched in 1929 to Munich where he was supported by a scholarship. He was taught by Leopold Wenger at the university \\"Institute for Papyrus Research and Legal History in Antiquity\\" (\\"Institut f√ºr Papyrusforschung und antike Rechtsgeschichte\\"). The primary focus of his research was a question arising from the Roman civil law of property which two years later formed the based for Kaser's habilitation and his book \\"Restituere als Proze√ügegenstand\\" (1932: republished with extensive further notes in 1968). Meanwhile he delivered a programme of lectures at Frankfurt University during the winter 1930/31 term before moving on to the nearby University of Giessen where he worked as a research assistant to Otto Eger. It was Eger who supervised Kaser for his habilitation degree which he received in June 1931. In 1932 he accepted a teaching post at M√ºnster where he took over from Hans Kreller who had transferred to T√ºbingen. In October 1933, still aged only 27, he accepted a full professorship in Civil and Roman law. He would remain at M√ºnster till 1959. Although his duties required him to take in interest in Civil law, his strong preference for Roman law was never in doubt. An administrative post was added in April 1937 when he was made dean of the law faculty. In this post he won and retained, through the energy and ability that he brought to the job, the confidence of his mostly rather conservative senior colleagues, while quietly resisting pressure to pander to Germany's increasingly institutionalised Nazism which he characterised (quietly) as an \\"Anticulture\\" (\\"Unkultur\\"). For Max Kaser 1933 was the year in which he met Erna Lehnig whose mother's family came from the M√ºnster region. Her father's family came from the coastal region of Pomerania. By the end of 1933 the two were married, demonstrating through their \\"Austrian-north German partnership\\" a \\"perfect harmony\\" as Kaser later wrote. It was both a loving and an efficient partnership. Erna Kaser proved a highly competent administrator, running the house - even to the point, slightly unusually for a \\"housewife\\" at that time, of taking care of the family's annual tax declaration - leaving her husband to concentrate on his work at the university. The marriage also produced, in rapid succession, a son and a daughter. Meanwhile Kaser's academic career and reputation progressed. He received and rejected apparently attractive offers of professorships from Heidelberg, Freiburg i.B. and Marburg in 1937, 1939, 1940, in every case preferring to stay put at M√ºnster \\"at [his] own wish\\", as he expressed the matter at the time in a letter to a colleague. When war broke out in 1939 Kaser, despite being still relatively young, was exempted from military service on account of a serious heart defect. However, as the slaughter of war intensified such matters counted for less, and in November 1943 he was conscripted into the army. He was initially engaged in anti- aircraft warfare but was soon sent back to M√ºnster where he worked as a clerk for the regimental administration (\\"Regimentsstab\\"). The army permitted him still to lecture at the university for two days each week. In April 1945 the Americans came. War ended a month later and Max Kaser became a prisoner of war. He was held in various American and French camps till his release, which followed in 1946. He returned to the university and resumed his teaching. The National Socialists had had their own views on Roman law. They found it \\"materialistic\\" and incompatible with their racist ideals, so they planned to replace the German legal code with their own People's Legal code which would (among other things) remove the influence of Roman Law over the German system. But now they were gone. Kaser could now be less constrained in his lecturing, his writing and on his networking. His reputation continued to grow. Offers of professorships came from Marburg (again) and Heidelberg (again). There were also offers from Graz (1951), G√∂ttingen (1952) and Vienna (1959). Till 1959 he rejected all such offers. When, in 1959, Kaser finally accepted an invitation to move, it was to accept a professorship at the University of Hamburg where he sustained a successful career in academic teaching and research till his formal retirement in 1971. Three of his personally supervised habilitation students from his time at Hamburg subsequently achieved eminence as university professors of jurisprudence. One of these, Dieter Medicus, later wrote an affectionate obituary in which he surmised that Kaser's decision to retire from his professorship at Hamburg had been accelerated by the student unrest of 1968 and its aftermath. He found himself unable to endorse or even to understand either the methods employed or the objectives of those involved. Whatever the truth of the matter, his retirement from Hamburg certainly did not mark an end to an active career as a law professor at a top university. Between 1971 and 1976 Kaser held a special professorship at the University of Salzburg, occupying the teaching chair for Roman and Civil law. He obtained the position following discussion with Theo Mayer-Maly and Wolfgang Waldstein. He let it be known to his friends that he very much relished the chance to teach Roman law to students who were not motivated by the tightly prescriptive regime under which study and exams were operated in the German system. He continued teaching at Salzburg till 1985, by which time he was almost 80. Between 1954 and 1972 Max Kaser was a co-producer of the prestigious Zeitschrift der Savigny-Stiftung f√ºr Rechtsgeschichte (ZRG), a venerable specialist journal for scholars and students of historical jurisprudence and related topics.  Memberships  Max Kaser was a member of various learned societies and other scholarly associations, some of which are listed below: * In 1959 he became a full member of the Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G√∂ttingen (\\"G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities\\"). * In 1960 he became a foreign member of the Accademia delle Scienze di Torino (\\"Turin Academy of Sciences and Humanities\\"). * In 1968 he became a member of the Naples Accademia delle Scienze (\\"Academy of sciences\\"). * In 1969 he became a foreign member of the Milan-based Istituto Lombardo Accademia di Scienze e Lettere (\\"Lombard Academy of Sciences and Letters \\"). * In 1971 he became a member of the Rome-based Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (literally, \\"[Italian] Academy of the lynxes\\"). * In 1972 he became a member of the √ñsterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften (\\"Austrian Academy of Sciences and Humanities\\"). * In 1973 he became a corresponding member of the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften (\\"Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities\\") in Munich. * In 1973 he became a member of the London-based British Academy. * In 1975 he was elected an honorary member of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies in London. * In 1988 he became a member of the ŒëŒ∫Œ±Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒØŒ± ŒëŒ∏Œ∑ŒΩœéŒΩ ([modern] \\"Academy of Athens\\").  Celebration and recognition  The \\"Max Kaser Seminar\\" at the University of Salzburg is named in Kaser's honour. The seminar's library, set up in 1966, consists of books, newspapers and other printed material by Ernst Levy, Erich Sacher and Max Kaser himself. The collection is meticulously kept up to date. Kaser's text books about Roman Civil Law and Roman legal history more broadly are widely studied and respected. They have been translated into a number of languages including English, Dutch, Finnish, Spanish, Japanese and Korean. Max Kaser also received a remarkably large number of honorary doctorates.

During her long career she combined technical skill with an impulse to innovate. Critics noted her versatility, pointing to skill in handling oil painting, lithography, etching, drawing, watercolor, and wood carving. Her style ranged from realist to abstract and from what one critic called a \\"discipline of an inner reticence\\" to a \\"more dynamic emotional expressionism.\\" Her early-career still lifes drew praise and a figure-group called \\"Exiles\\" received much attention following its acquisition by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Her mid-career work was more expressive and abstract as she tried, as she put it, to rid herself \\"from the tyranny of nature.\\" At the end of her career she was particularly known for semi-abstract work in glass and enamel, mainly of religious subjects. Early life and education Bry was born in St. Louis on November 30, 1898. In 1910 or soon thereafter her family moved to Manhattan and she subsequently attended the Ethical Culture School on Central Park West. Bry showed an early interest in art. In the years before the outbreak of the First World War her parents would take her and her siblings on vacation trips to Europe and during these travels she was able to examine art in capital cities such as Paris and Madrid. In an early effort to teach herself to draw, she would copy the art postcards she bought. In 1915 she worked briefly in a New York batik studio. After graduating from high school in 1917 she studied for two years at the Art Students League. Her teachers there included J. Alden Weir, Winold Reiss, Guy P√®ne du Bois, Charles Locke, and Alexander Archipenko. During travels in Germany sometime not long after the end of the First World War she studied briefly under Hermann Struck and Siegfried Laboschin. Much later, in speaking of her formal art training, she told an interviewer, \\"I didn't want to study too long with any one teacher. A teacher can help along a certain line, but too many students stay too long with teachers, and imitate them. It is important for an artist to analyze his own work critically and to work by himself.\\" In the late 1950s she worked with Abraham Rattner, a painter who, like Bry, showed a late-career interest in mosaic and stained-glass. Career in art In 1927 Bry showed portraits and abstractions that she called \\"imaginative creations\\" in a solo exhibition at a gallery in Corsicana, Texas. The portraits showed George Gershwin, Rebecca West, Irwin Edman, and other well-known people. She told a reporter that by expressing her feelings the abstractions helped her to overcome depression and \\"turbulent moods.\\" A year later the New York Post included her portrait of Carl Van Doren in its Saturday Gravure section and two of her drawings were included in a show organized by the Opportunity Gallery. Over the next few years her work appeared in group shows at the same gallery and in the gallery of a printer of limited edition books. In 1932 she exhibited with two other women in the G.R.D. Gallery. The still lifes in that show drew comment from a critic for the New York Times who praised her \\"knowing technique\\" and appreciated her enigmatic titles. (\\"Atavic,\\" for a still life of red cabbage, beets, and eggplant, was one.) She joined the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors in 1934 and contributed paintings to some of its exhibitions, but she did not take an active role in that organization. When she showed line drawings in a 1935 exhibition at the National Association's Argent Galleries, a critic praised her skill, writing that her \\"drawings might bid Picasso look to his laurels. In October 1935 she held a solo exhibition of oil paintings at a commercial gallery in St. Louis. A notice of the show in the St. Louis Star drew attention to her versatility. \\"Her output,\\" it said, \\"is large, not only in oil, but in etching, lithography, wood carving, and sanguine crayon.\\" Edith Bry, Exiled, lithograph, 9 √ó 11 7/8 inches The following year she was given a solo exhibition at the Grant Gallery in which she showed still lifes, landscapes, and scenes showing indigenous Mexicans. In 1937 she showed a lithograph called \\"Exiled\\" in the International Print Makers Exhibition at the Los Angeles Museum. The Los Angeles Times headed its article on the show with a reproduction of the print and its critic said it was \\"grim.\\" This 1936 lithograph and a 1937 painting she made of the same scene were later purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The lithograph can be seen at right. Bry joined the nonprofit Studio Guild in 1937. During the next few years she participated in the Studio Guild's exhibitions. She also helped to arrange Guild-sponsored events that raised money for overseas relief work. In 1938, for example, she organized the sale of works donated by 130 artists for funds to support the work of the Joint Distribution Committee to help European Jews escape Nazi persecution. A year later she contributed works to a Guild exhibition that circulated among museums and galleries around the country. In 1940, when the Metropolitan Museum of Art put \\"Exiled\\" on view, a New York Sun reporter interviewed Bry. In the interview, she said she intended the painting to convey a sense of finality and doom. While she recognized that it was topical, she said there was nothing propagandistic in her intent. In 1941 Bry became active in an artists' advocacy group called the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors. She showed in its first and in subsequent annual exhibitions and participated in special exhibitions as well. Her contribution of a collage called \\"Equations\\" in the 35th annual exhibition of 1976 seems to have been her last. She served as recording secretary and vice-president of the organization and in 1945 was elected its president. Bry continued to participate in group exhibitions during the war years, but she also volunteered her time in war-related work. In 1942 she began art classes for wounded soldiers, a year later she made war bond posters and made skin-draft drawings for a plastic surgeon, and in 1945 she painted irises for artificial eyes. Edith Bry, Palin, 1937, lithograph, 12 1/2 x 8 3/4 inches Before the war Bry had traveled to Guatemala which then became the source of much of her later work. Working from sketches she made then, she finished a lithograph called \\"Palin\\" in 1945 (seen at left). Showing Guatemalan Indians grouped around a Ceiba tree, the print was commissioned by a commercial gallery called Associated American Artists. In the post-war years she continued to show oils, watercolors, and prints in group exhibitions held by the associations of which she was a member and in 1951 was given a solo exhibition at the John Heller gallery. The latter drew critics' attention for what one called a shift in her work from \\"visual sobriety\\" to expressionistic feeling. Bry explained the transition as an effort to free herself from the \\"tyranny of nature.\\" She aimed to move from painting subjects \\"in the customary sense like a figure or scene\\" toward a more direct expression of emotion. In these deeply felt works she increasingly showed religious subjects. In the late 1950s Bry began to experiment with works in fused glass and vitreous enamel and thereafter began to make fused glass panels mainly for places of worship. After her death in 1991 she was best known for these works of the 1960s and 1970s. In 1983 the Loeb Student Art Center at New York University gave her a retrospective exhibition. =Artistic style= Edith Bry, Fire Island 3, 1964, watercolor, 5 x 6 1/2 inches Edith Bry, Moonlit Ocean Seascape, about 1980, collage, 35 x 40 inches Bry was a versatile artist who painted in oils, drew using graphite and crayon, and produced watercolors, and pastels. She made lithographs, woodcuts, and etchings. She did wood carving, mosaics, and large works in glass employing fused glass and enamel. Although her style evolved considerably during her long career, she avoided non-objectivism. She deployed degrees of abstraction, beginning with social realism and proceeding to a nearly free- form abstract expressionism. The progression was not clear-cut, however. Early in her career she made what she called \\"imaginative paintings\\" and in mid- career she made paintings that were, she said, \\"free harmonies of beautiful glowing colors.\\" Late in her career she was still producing realist work such as the watercolor, \\"Fire Island 3,\\" shown at right. For the most part her work could be described as semi-abstract. Its subjects were discernible, whether easily so, or only on close examination. She was seen as an expressive artist. A critic noted a tension between two styles of expressive work, one that revealed the \\"discipline of an inner reticence\\" and another consisting of a \\"more dynamic emotional expressionism.\\" Critics saw this expressive content in both her realist and the more abstract paintings. Her collage, \\"Moonlit Ocean Seascape,\\" at left, shows her late abstract style. She was noted for her skill in composition and handling of color. In 1932 a critic praised three still life paintings for \\"their good spacial design and pleasing relation of color.\\" Another said she arranged \\"her subject matter in compositions as interesting for their color harmonies as they are for their harmonies of form.\\" A few years later Howard Devree, of the New York Times praised her \\"growth in compositional conception, and advance in paint values and ... mature and gratifying sureness of approach\\" and a critic for the New York Post said she had a flair for composition: \\"she places the objects in her still lifes in pleasing relations of form and space; the flowers in her bouquets have a spacial existence, air flows between the blossoms and around them.\\" When painting in oils Bry usually used a palette knife rather than a brush. During much of her career, she worked five days a week from about 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. Personal life and family Bry was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on November 28, 1898. She was the daughter of Louis Bry (1861-1928) and Melanie Scharff Bry (1869-1933). Her siblings were Martin Edwin Bry (1891-1962), Louis Bry, Jr. (1895-1961), Nathan William Bry (1900-1982), and Adolph William Bry (1908-1938). In 1880 Louis Bry, Sr. emigrated to the United States from Rawitsch, Prussia (now Rawicz, Poland) and became a partner of his older brother, Nathan, in running successful department stores in Camden, Arkansas and Memphis, Tennessee. The brothers also operated a clothing manufacturing business called Bry & Brother Cloak Company in St. Louis. In 1906 Louis moved to New York. There, he partnered with a relative named Edwin Bry (not his son), in a woolen manufacturing business with offices in Philadelphia and New York. He later served as a consultant to a business run by his sons Edwin and Louis. Louis and Melanie were married in St. Louis in 1890. Edith Bry, Photo of the woodcarving over fireplace in library of her home Bry married in 1921. Her husband, Maurice Shevelson Benjamin (1896-1984), was an engineer and founder of a brokerage firm called Benjamin, Hill & Company. They remained married to each other for the rest of their lives. Their only child, Bry Benjamin, was born in 1924 and died in 2009. In 1929 the family moved to a large apartment on an upper floor in the newly-opened Beresford building on Central Park West. The apartment had been designed for them in Art Deco style by a well-known architect, Ely Jacques Kahn. Bry carved the wood panel that was set over the fireplace in the library. The panel can be seen in the photo at right and in the portrait of Bry and her husband at top. Edith Bry died at home in New York on January 19, 1991.

It is also simply known as \\"Ardealul\\" (). It appeared after the cession of Northern Transylvania to Hungary in 1940. At the time, Romania was also forced to give up Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and the Hertza region to the Soviet Union, and Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria. The Second Vienna Award of August 30, which caused the loss of Northern Transylvania, caused great consternation among the Romanian public. Its author is unknown, although it is thought to have been a contemporary soldier. It is recorded that demobilized soldiers from Northern Transylvania went to »òiria and sung the first stanza of the song. Here, it quickly became popular among the inhabitants. It was also sung in 1944 during the Budapest Offensive when Romanian troops attacked Hungary to recover the region. Nowadays, it can be found in the repertoire of the Romanian Army Choir or the male choir of the village of Finteu»ôu Mare. From the latter, the folk singer Veta Biri»ô took the song and added it to her repertoire, with different lyrics written by a collaborator of her. These refer to the emigration of Romanians abroad since 1989. Another folk singer who has made his own version is Felix GƒÉlan. Furthermore, it is a song used by legionnaires in the country.

Ray, 386 U.S. 547 (1967), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court first introduced the justification for qualified immunity for police officers from being sued for civil rights violations under Section 1983, by arguing that \\"[a] policeman's lot is not so unhappy that he must choose between being charged with dereliction of duty if he does not arrest when he had probable cause, and being mulcted in damages if he does.\\"Schwartz, Joanna C. (2017). \\"How Qualified Immunity Fails\\" (PDF). The Yale Law Journal. Yale Law School. Retrieved February 26, 2020.  Background  The case refers to the incident in Jackson, Mississippi where 15 Episcopal priests were arrested after entering the coffee shop at the local Trailways bus terminal. The group were part of 28 priests from Episcopal Society for Cultural and Racial Unity, taking part in the Mississippi Freedom Rides, traveling from the Deep South to the Great Lakes. Meeting on the evening of September 11, 1961 in New Orleans, they left the following day on a chartered bus which would take them via McComb into Tougaloo, a small town outside Jackson. They would then split into three groups traveling north via Sewanee into Detroit. Tri-State Trailways depot, Jackson, Miss. (1940s Postcard) = Incident = On September 13th 1961, a group of 15 including 3 black priests took taxis from Tougaloo into the nearby Jackson Trailways bus terminal to catch the bus to Chattanooga. When entering the coffee shop to have lunch before their departure, they were stopped by two policemen, Officers David Allison Nichols and Joseph David Griffith, who asked them to leave. After refusing to leave, Captain JL Ray arrested and jailed all 15 priests for breach of peace, using a now-repealed section of the Mississippi code ¬ß 2087.5 that \\"makes guilty of a misdemeanor anyone who congregates with others in a public place under circumstances such that a breach of the peace may be occasioned thereby, and refuses to move on when ordered to do so by a police officer.\\" The group included 35-year-old Reverend Robert L Pierson, who was son-in-law to the Republican Governor of New York, Nelson Rockefeller. They were brought to trial before the local judge James Spencer who found them guilty of breach of peace and sentenced them to 4 months in jail and $200 fine. After raising money for bail, they appealed the case de novo in the Hinds County Court. The case against the priests was dismissed by Judge Russell Moore showing no violation of law (directed verdict) on May 21, 1962. = Civil claim for damages under Section 1983 = Represented by Carl Rachlin, the chief legal counsel at Congress of Racial Equality, they sought damages in the Jackson district court before Judge Sidney Mize, alleging the police and the local judge had violated Title 42, Section 1983 of the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act by false arrest and imprisonment for exercising their civil rights. However, the jury found in favor of the police who said they were trying to prevent imminent violence from a gathered crowd, contradicting the evidence of the priests. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found that the local judge was immune from liability for his decision. Although the appeal court found the Mississippi code unconstitutional, it found that \\"Mississippi law does not require police officers to predict at their peril which state laws are constitutional and which are not.\\"  Supreme Court  Rachlin appealed to the Supreme Court on behalf of four of the priests: Robert L Pierson, John B Morris, James P Breeden and James G Jones Jr ‚Äì Breeden was the only black petitioner. The defendants were Police Chief (then Captain) JL Ray, his two officers Griffiths and Nichols, and municipal police justice, Judge James Spencer. Captain Ray and Judge Spencer had already arrested and sentenced more than 300 Freedom Riders for \\"breach of peace\\" before this incident. They were represented by Elizabeth Watkins Hulen Grayson. Rachlin had made the argument on the basis of the Civil Rights Act of 1871's section 1979, which was codified into the US Civil Code Title 42 Chapter 21 Section 1983. The original 1871 Act stated that = Ruling = Eight of the nine justices agreed with the Fifth Circuit that Judge Spencer had absolute immunity from liability for damages, and that Section 1983 would not apply in a judge's case, stating that \\"the immunity of judges for acts within the judicial role is equally well established, and we presume that Congress would have specifically so provided had it wished to abolish the doctrine.\\". This principle of immunity of judges from liability for damages was established in common law as found in the case Bradley v. Fisher (1872).. They went on to state that although police officers are not granted absolute and unqualified immunity from liability for damages, they may be excused \\"from liability for acting under a statute that he reasonably believed to be valid but that was later held unconstitutional, on its face or as applied\\", similar to the principle that a police officer \\"... who arrests someone with probable cause is not liable for false arrest simply because the innocence of the suspect is later proved.\\" However, the justices found that the jury trial was influenced by irrelevant and prejudicial evidence, which included trying to get the priests to agree that their views on racial justice and equality aligned with the Communist movement. They also disagreed with the appeal court that the priests had consented to their arrest merely by gathering in the terminal under the principle of volenti non fit injuria Therefore, a new trial could be remanded to claim damages against the police. Only Justice Douglas dissented, stating that Section 1983 must include the judiciary who too must be liable for civil rights violations in the course of their duties. He pointed to the debate in Congress during the Act's inception where \\"members of Congress objected to the statute because it imposed liability on members of the judiciary.\\" Accordingly, as the Act was passed without providing any exception for the judiciary, he concluded that Congress intended for Section 1983 to apply to 'any person', including judges.  Legacy  US Civil Code= Following this interpretation, Section 1983 of the Civil Code was amended twice, once in 1979 to include Washington, D.C. within its remits.https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim- title42-section1983#=0&edition;=prelim The later 1996 amendment was part of a series of amendments to the US Code included in the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996. Although the submitted Bill by Sen Chuck Grassley (R-IA) sought to streamline the judiciary and make it more efficient, it was amended by the Senate Judiciary Committee led by Sen Orrin Hatch to include provisions to protect judicial officers from liability. The committee gave the following justification for codifying immunity for the judiciary in this amendment.https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/104th-congress/senate- report/366/ = Current version = The current version reads (amendments from original are shown with ): = Congress 2020 = Following a number of civilian deaths during encounters with US police, there was a heightened awareness of the case and the concept of qualified immunity, coming to a head with the killing of George Floyd in May 2020. Numerous other similar cases where the government had settled cases and law enforcement officers were able to claim qualified immunity came to light, placing public pressure on Congress to rectify the situation. In the Senate, Cory Booker (D-NJ) introduced a resolution which asserts that the broad overreach and injustice of the concept of qualified immunity stemming from successive Supreme Court decisions is based \\"on a mistaken judicial interpretation of a statute enacted by Congress\\".https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Qualified%20Immunity%20resolution.pdf In Congress, Justin Amash (L-MI) introduced the Ending Qualified Immunity Acthttps://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7085/all-info which criticized the interpretation of Section 1983 by the Supreme Court in Pierson v.

It was and is the principal method used by the governments of Mandatory Palestine and Israel respectively, to acquire land from Palestinians and sell it to Israeli settlers. According to B'Tselem, it was used to expropriate 16% of the West Bank.B'Tselem, By Hook and by Crook: Israeli Settlement Policy in the West Bank (July 2010): \\"The settlement enterprise has been characterized, since its inception, by an instrumental, cynical, and even criminal approach to international law, local legislation, Israeli military orders, and Israeli law, which has enabled the continuous pilfering of land from Palestinians in the West Bank. The principal means Israel used for this purpose was declaration of ‚Äústate land,‚Äù a mechanism that resulted in the seizure of more than 900,000 dunams of land (sixteen percent of the West Bank), with most of the declarations being made in 1979-1992. The interpretation that the State Attorney's Office gave to the concept ‚Äústate land‚Äù in the Ottoman Land Law contradicted explicit statutory provisions and judgments of the Mandatory Supreme Court. Without this distorted interpretation, Israel would not have been able to allocate such extensive areas of land for the settlements.\\"  Historical background  There is a complex mix of still-operative, Ottoman, British, Jordanian, Israeli, Palestinian and international law at work in the West Bank. Land and villages of the West Bank did not have a cadastral survey during the Palestine Mandate. By the Six Day War of 1967, only a third of the land had been registered.  Regulatory position and procedure  The Custodian Staff Officer of the Civil Administration (also Supervisor of Governmental and Abandoned Property in \\"Judea and Samaria\\") is the representative of the Israel Land Authority to the West Bank, whose responsibilities include the declaration of public land (‚Äústate land‚Äù). The declaration procedure is an internal process of the Civil Administration. Usually the Custodian signs a certificate specifying the location and area of the land along with a map. The certificate is sent to the mukhtars of affected villages. Objections must be submitted within 45 days and if not, the declaration is considered final and the Custodian may take possession of the land.  Elon Moreh case  A 1979 proceedings known as the \\"Elon Moreh\\" case (Dweikat et al. v. Government of Israel) the Israeli Supreme Court ended the use of military orders for the seizure of private Palestinian land for settlements and provided the impetus for Israel to establish a new legal basis for the requisition of land if it was to be used for settlement. Following this case, during the period 1979 to 1992, 908,000 dunums were declared as state land based on a \\"stringent interpretation\\" of the 1858 Ottoman Land Code.  Blue Line task force  Area of \\"state land\\" declarations ratified by year (in dunums) In 1999, the \\"Blue Line Task Force\\" was created to re-examine land not clearly designated as State land during the 1980s. The approval of this task force is a precondition for new settlement construction plans.  Declarations after 2014  \\"State Land\\" declarations in the Gush Etzion settlement area (Bethlehem) According to Peace Now, declarations had ceased after the roadmap was concluded in 2003 but that following Netanyahu's taking office in 2009, declarations totalled more than 6000 dunums as of the end of 2015.

The story follows a Chinese fisherman's friendship with the title character, a water spirit who has to drown a human being in the river in which he is imprisoned, in order to be reincarnated. Plot One evening, a successful Zichuan fisherman named Xu () befriends a man who introduces himself as Wang Liulang (). Wang assists Xu with his fishing, ensuring that he has a more bountiful catch, and the two men spend the next six months fishing and drinking together in the evening; but one day Wang bids Xu farewell and reveals that he is in fact the ghost of an alcoholic who had drowned in the river and is set to be reincarnated the following day. He also tells Xu that a woman is slated to take his place by drowning in the river at noon. The next day, Xu spots a woman with a baby about to cross the river at noon; sure enough, she slips and both mother and baby fall into the river. However, they safely make it to the shore. Wang later confesses to Xu that he could not bring himself to ruin two lives. Some time afterwards, as a reward for his compassionate act, Wang is appointed as a minor deity in Zhaoyuan. On hearing this, Xu travels there and is greeted by villagers whose dreams have foretold of his coming. After paying his respects to Wang at the village temple, Xu is visited by him in his dreams. Xu's family becomes more prosperous and he retires from fishing; years later, Wang continues to be venerated by the locals. In his postscript, Pu comments on the fragility of friendships and briefly narrates about a destitute villager who travelled a thousand li to call upon a childhood friend who had become a high-ranking official, only to be rebuffed. Publication history Originally titled \\"Wang Liulang\\" (; literally \\"Wang the Sixth Lad\\"), the story was first published in Pu Songling's anthology of close to five hundred short stories, Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio or Liaozhai Zhiyi. Allan Barr writes that it was probably part of the opening volume of ghost stories ( 1670s‚Äì1683) in the original eight-volume incarnation of Strange Tales. The story has been translated into English, including in the first volume of Sidney L. Sondergard's Strange Tales from Liaozhai (2008) as \\"Sixth Brother Wang\\". Themes and analysis Tina Lu writes that the central theme of the story is personal identity‚Äî\\"the question of what a person is, from the specific perspective of the supernatural.\\" She also notes that Pu is alluding to \\"one of the most famous passages from Mencius\\" on compassion and human nature: Mencius argues that the hypothetical and innately compassionate bystander observing the baby's fall is prompted to act by a \\"spontaneous sense of fellow-feeling\\"; Wang Liulang is not only driven by fellow-feeling, but also stands to lose his life by forgoing a chance at reincarnation. Lu suggests that Pu is questioning if Wang‚Äîwho is not biologically human but displays much humanity by sparing the mother and child‚Äîshould be regarded as more legitimate of a person than \\"people who are biologically human but not morally so\\". Ian McGreal cites Wang Liulang as \\"a very good example of a virtuous ghost\\", while a reviewer for Asiaweek writes that Pu is promoting \\"friendships that are based on unreserved self-abnegation\\". Allan Barr comments that Pu satirises \\"the inconstancy of human ties\\" with his presentation of a \\"loyal friendship between a man and a ghost\\", comparing it with similarly satirical Strange Tales entries as \\"Planting a Pear Tree\\", \\"The Snake Man\\", and \\"Three Lives\\". Adaptations Based on Pu's short story and produced by the Beijing-based Theater San Tuoqi, the play Aquatique () was first performed in July 2012 at the Th√©√¢tre Golovine in Avignon, France as part of the 66th Avignon Theatre Festival. It made its debut in China in January 2013.

The genus contains a single species, the type species Terminocavus sealeyi, known from a parietal and some other associated fragments. The holotype specimen was discovered in the Kirtland Formation of New Mexico in 1997, and was later described and named in a 2020 study. It was similar in anatomy to Pentaceratops and Anchiceratops, which is was closely related to, but had a distinctive heart-shaped upper frill with very narrow notch. It has been hypothesized to form an anagenetic series with several other chasmosaur species. Discovery and naming Geological map of the southeast San Juan Basin; B (upper middle) is where the holotype was found The holotype specimen NMMNH P-27468, collected in 1997, consists of a parietal (or fused paired parietals), other skull fragments, a partial sacrum, and vertebral fragments. It was discovered in grey siltstone deposits from the Campanian Hunter Wash Member of the Kirtland Formation of the San Juan Basin in New Mexico. It is the only diagnostic chasmosaurine specimen discovered from the middle or upper part of the Hunter Wash Member. The age of the specimen is undetermined; its frill texture indicates it is a young subadult, but its large size and epiparietal fusion would indicate it represents an adult. A 2005 abstract referred the specimen to the genus Pentaceratops, though noted as aberrant for the genus. Joshua Fry questioned the referral in a 2015 masters thesis, with a phylogenetic analysis failing to group it alongside other Pentaceratops specimens. It was informally named as a distinct genus in 2016. Later, in 2020, it was formally named and described by Denver W. Fowler and Elizabeth A. Freedman Fowler. The name Terminocavus means \\"coming to the end of the cavity\\", referring to the parietal embayment being nearly closed off before being lost completely in more derived taxa. The specific name, sealeyi, refers to the discoverer of the holotype specimen, Paul Sealey. Naming the specimen as a new species of Pentaceratops was decided against to prevent the genus becoming paraphyletic. The nearly complete, but highly distorted skull PMU 23923 may belong to the species as well. Also hailing form the Kirtland Formation, Charles H. Sternberg discovered it in 1921. It was later named as the new species \\"Pentaceratops fenestratus\\" in 1930, but by future authors have considered its distinctiveness to be a result of pathology. Though sometimes considered a synonym of Pentaceratops sternbergi, Fowler and Freedman Fowler considered it more likely to belong to either Navajoceratops or Terminocavus due to its deep, narrow median embayment and broad parietal bar. The specimen is too distorted to allow confidant referral to either, however. Description Preserved parietal anatomy of Terminocavus (H, lower right) compared to its close relatives Known from limited material, Terminocavus is distinguished from close relatives such as Pentaceratops and Anchiceratops by the anatomy of its parietal (the upper portion of its frill), which forms a heart shape. The prominent median embayment (a large notch in the middle of the top of the frill) of earlier taxa is heavily reduced, being very narrow as opposed to wide and \\"U\\" shaped. Terminocavus' parietal bars (the top edges of the frill) is thin and extremely broad compared to earlier relatives; it is more plate-shaped than bar-shaped. Its median bar (the middle strut) has also expanded, bearing more pronounced flanges than its ancestor Navajoceratops. The parietal fenestrae (the holes in the frill) have a more rounded shape than the ancestral angular state, and are smaller due to the expanded parietal and median bars. Overall, the anatomy is intermediate between that of more primitive genera like Pentaceratops and that of more derived ones like Anchiceratops and triceratopsins. Life restoration Like most other chasmosaurs, its paired fused parietals combined bear six epiparietals (small horns along the parietal), symmetrically arranged with three on each side. The first pair, small and triangular, project from the top edge of the median embayment, and in life would have touched each other. The second pair are a larger set of triangles, whereas the third epiparietals have a rounded, \\"D\\" shape; both project upwards, angled in line with the rest of the parietal. The preserved right squamosal (bone which forms the right side of the frill) itself is long, indicating adult Terminocavus had a very large frill similar to that of its relatives. A singular, fused episquamosal (small horns along the squamosal) is also known from the holotype; it is rugose and indistinct from that of other ceratopsids. The left epijugal horn is known as well, fused to the jugal and quadratojugal bones; it robust and large, but unlike that of Pentaceratops is not especially long. Terminocavus known remains are slightly smaller than those of Utahceratops and Pentaceratops, indicating it was an animal of roughly similar adult size. Classification Terminocavus was a member of the ceratopsid subfamily Chasmosaurinae. Fowler and Freedman Folwler (2020) divide chasmosaurs into two lineages; a \\"Chasmosaurus-line\\" leading to Kosmoceratops and a \\"Pentaceratops-line\\" leading to more derived taxa. Terminocavus belongs to the latter group. Phylogenetic analysis found it to be relatively derived, more basal than Anchiceratops but more derived than Navajocertops. The tree, however, is unstable; removing some taxa from the analysis caused much of the Pentaceratops-line to collapse into an unresolved polytomy. Additionally, it was noted the coding of the Pentaceratops and Chasmosaurus data may requires revision, as it likely contains specimens of more than one species; it was noted this could be impacitng the results negatively. Several taxa had been named too recently to be included in the study describing Terminocavus, and their inclusion in an analysis could also shift its position. One analysis from Fowler and Freedman Fowler (2020) is reproduced below: Skull of Pentaceratops, proposed ancestor of Terminocavus Stratigraphic diagram demonstrating the proposed anagenetic lineages of chasmosaurs; frill of Terminocavus is \\"I\\", upper right, shown next to that of its close relatives It was proposed that Terminocavus is a part of a long anagenetic lineage of chasmosaurs. The genera (in sequence) Utahceratops, Pentaceratops, Navajoceratops, Terminocavus, and Anchiceratops would, under this model, represent a single population of organisms changing in form over time, rather than as a diverse assembledge of close relatives. This is evidenced by their parietal morphology, which show consistent trends of change. These are: the gradual closure of the initially large medial embayment, flattening and expansion of the parietal bar, reduction of size of the parietal fenestrae, the change of its shape from [sub]angular to round, and development of flanges on the medial bar. Geometric morphometric analysis supported the sequence, finding them to plot in the expected order. The phylogenetic analysis (see above), however, complicated matters, with the genera Coahuilaceratops and Bravoceratops plotting within the supposed anagenetic lineage. It was noted, however, that these are fragmentary and undiagnostic respectively, and so they may not be of significance.

He played two first-class matches for Queensland between 1892-93 and 1893-94. He was South Brisbane's first captain in Queensland district cricket. Cricket career Fisher was playing cricket for the Alberts club in Brisbane in the 1880's and in 1886 he was a member of an Alberts side which played a Rockhampton XI and was noted as one of the standout players. In 1887 he began playing for Blackalls Club, and in November 1887 he was selected to represent Queensland in a non First-class tour game against the touring English side, and he played for Queensland against the English again in a second tour game in December. In January 1888 Fisher was selected to represent a Combined XI for clubs in the senior cricket association in Brisbane which played a Combined XI for clubs from the junior association. He was playing for Alberts Cricket Club again in 1888, and was noted as one of the best batsmen in Queensland for the year having the highest average in senior cricket, 25.63 from sixteen innings. In March 1889 he was selected to represent Queensland again in a non First-class inter-colonial cricket match against New South Wales which Queensland won, although Fisher was run out for four in Queensland's innings. He won the Alberts club trophy for best batting in 1889, having scored 101 not out in the season which was the highest for the club. In 1891 Fisher played in a match for Indooroopilly Cricket Club, in addition to continuing to represent Alberts, and in March he also represented Queensland again in an intercolonial match. In 1892 Fisher scored 205 in a match for the B.I. Club in a game against Brisbane Hospital which was the record score for the season, and he also won the Alberts Club trophy for best batting again for averaging 32.00 over ten innings for the club. As of October 1892 Fisher was keeping wicket for Alberts, and by January 1893 he was captaining the side. Queensland was granted first-class status in the 1892-93 season, and in April 1893 Fisher was selected in the inaugural state first-class side in a match played against New South Wales in Brisbane scoring 11 in both of Queensland's innings.Queensland v NSW 1-4 April 1893 In March 1894 he was selected again for Queensland's second first-class game which was played in Sydney against New South Wales and he scored 11 and 7.NSW v Queensland 24-28 March 1894 Fisher continued to play for Albert into 1895. In 1897 the Queensland Cricket Association disbanded the senior cricket competitions, instead establishing an electoral cricket competition with new clubs defined by residents in electorates being formed to compete in it. Fisher joined the newly formed South Brisbane Club and was appointed to a committee to find a cricket ground for the club, and served as the first captain of the club when the 1897-98 season began. He was still captaining the side as of 1904, and 1905 appears to have been his final year playing for the club. In September 1905 Fisher captained a side for a benefit match for retiring cricketer W. Swain, and in September 1907 he captained a Brisbane team which played a match in Waterford at an evening which also featured a concert and a dance. In 1908 he played in an annual game between a Francis's XI and Beaudesert C.C. playing for Francis's XI. In 1909 he returned to Waterford with another team and scored 40 runs batting at 10, and the same year he played 'holiday cricket' captaining an A.U.S.N. Company side against a side of the crew of the ship Wyreema. In 1911 he played in a Veterans match between teams of veteran cricketers from Brisbane and Ipswich, captaining the Brisbane team. In 1924 Fisher was one of several Queensland team-mates of Percy McDonnell who attended a tribute ceremony. In 1934 Fisher visited Sydney to attend a Sheffield Shield match between Victoria and New South Wales and a tennis tournament.

Origins  He was the leader of a minor knightly family in Lincolnshire owing fealty to William d'Albini of Bevoir.  Life and career  He was constable of Bristol castle from August 1204 to March 1208. From July 1207 to sometime in 1210 he held the castle of Kenilworth Castle, an extremely important castle as it controlled the trade routes to Coventry and was an important administrative center in Warwickshire. In 1207 he was appointed itinerant justice in Warwickshire. It is known that he held the Honour (Barony) of Leicester as custodian in 1205-1209 along with the archdeacon of Staffordshire. He was sheriff of Warwickshire and Leicestershire between 1212 and 1215. It is likely that Robert had considerable control in Leicestershire given the fact that he was custodian between 1205-1209 and thus had the chance to establish himself as a powerful player within the shire. In 1215 he was among the representatives sent to Otto of Brunswick along with Robert of Burgate. During King John's reign Robert is recorded as having witnessed 20 charters, an indication that he was at the kings side in intervals and he was an important member of John's court. Shortly after June 14th 1215 he had defected to the barons side in the Second Barons War despite his close relationship with king John. This was because he held some of his lands from or near rebels: William d'Albini of Belvoir and some lands in the richmong honour. Despite four letters offering safe conduct to Robert if he would rejoin the royal cause, he was a rebel through and through after 1215.  Fiefs  From William d'Albini of Belvoir: Manor of Ropsley - Lincolnshire From The Barons of Richmond: Manor of Frampton - Lincolnshire Manor of Donington - Lincolnshire  Family  He married Mabel de Limsey daughter of Gerard de Limsey and widow of Hugh Bardulf. The marriage was almost certainly arranged by the king as a reward for his services.

He is best known for his contributions to computational electromagnetics with his development of method of moments (MoM). Harrington's 1968 book, Field Computation by Moment Methods, is regarded as a pivotal textbook on the subject. Biography Harrington was born on December 24, 1925, in Buffalo, New York. He started majoring in electrical engineering in 1943 at Syracuse University; his studies were interrupted in the following year by World War II. During this time, he served as an instructor under the Electronics Training Program at the U.S. Naval Radio Materiel School in Dearborn, Michigan, while working as an electronics technician. He completed his studies after the war, receiving B.S. and M.S. degrees in 1948 and 1950, respectively. Briefly remaining at Syracuse University as a research assistant and instructor, he started his doctoral studies under Victor H. Rumsey at Ohio State University, receiving his PhD in 1952. Harrington returned to Syracuse University following his doctoral studies, working there as a professor until his retirement in 1994. Following his retirement, he briefly worked as a visiting professor at University of Arizona. During his tenure at Syracuse University, he has worked on research projects for the U.S. Army Signal Corps, Office of Naval Research, General Electric and the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research. He has also held visiting professorship positions at University of Illinois in between 1959 and 1960, University of California, Berkeley in 1964 and the Technical University of Denmark in 1969. Harrington is a recipient of IEEE Centennial Medal, IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society Distinguished Achievement Award and IEEE Electromagnetics Award in 1984, 1989 and 2000, respectively. In 2014, he was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal in electrical engineering for his contributions to the study of electromagnetics. He currently resides in Wheaton, Illinois with his daughter. Research Harrington has published two standard engineering textbooks, Introduction to Electromagnetic Engineering in 1958 and Time-Harmonic Electromagnetic Fields in 1961. In 1968, he published Field Computation by Moment Methods, which introduced the unified and generalized theory of method of moments (MoM), an integral equation method for solving electromagnetic problems. The development of the method stemmed from Harrington's initial interest in using electromagnetic fields in thermonuclear fusion research. Harrington further developed the method in his future publications; method of moments later became one of go-to methods in the study of antennas, integrated circuits and waveguides, among others. Harrington's further work included the study of radiation and scattering in bodies of revolution, dielectric scattering, field integral equations and theory of characteristic modes. Harrington also expanded Lan Jen Chu and Harold Alden Wheeler's theory on the fundamental limits of electrically small radio antennas; Chu‚ÄìHarrington limit, which yields a lower bound for the Q factor of a small radio antenna, is named after him.

CityNews, June 4, 2020. The film stars Katerine Savard as Nadia, an Olympic swimmer struggling to redefine her life after retiring from the sport at the conclusion of the 2020 Summer Olympics. Its cast also includes Canadian competitive swimmers Ariane Mainville and Hilary Caldwell in supporting roles as Nadia's friends and teammates, as well as Pierre-Yves Cardinal. Production and distribution Plante wrote the film in part based on his own experiences as a competitive swimmer who tried out, but did not qualify, to represent Canada at the 2008 Summer Olympics. He has described the film as \\"basically a film about the post-Olympic blues, the very tipping point of that transition from being an athlete to having to redefine herself and understanding what it means to leave it all behind.\\" Savard, an Olympic swimmer, auditioned for the role after being one of the swimmers Plante consulted for input into the screenplay.Gregory Strong, \\"Canadian swimmer Savard makes acting debut in Cannes-selected film\\".

Ici Radio-Canada Sports, August 26, 2019.

It had its commercial premiere on September 18, 2020.St√©phanie Morin, \\"Nadia, Butterfly sur grand √©cran au Qu√©bec\\". La Presse, July 29, 2020. Critical response For The Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney wrote that \\"Most movies about the physical rigors and psychological toll that force high- performance athletes to give up their chosen discipline ‚Äî whether it's swimming, track and field, ballet or any other ‚Äî tend to focus on the pain and injuries, the punishing schedule, the exhaustion, the disappointments of a career in decline. What makes Plante's drama distinctive is that the decision to quit has already been made both privately and publicly, and the detachment is already in process as Nadia (Katerine Savard) gives an awkward press interview while she's still catching her breath after an individual race toward the close of the Tokyo Summer Olympics. \\"I guess I'm trying to end on a good note,\\" she says, visibly anxious to step away.\\"David Rooney, \\"'Nadia, Butterfly': Film Review\\". The Hollywood Reporter, July 29, 2020. Writing for The Globe and Mail, Barry Hertz stated that the unfortunate coincidence of the film's timing, having been filmed before but released after the cancellation of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, gave the film's setting at that event an unintentional veneer of alternate history. He opined that \\"while Savard has her moments - including a deep cry backstage after capturing the bronze - she is not strong enough to do the heavy emotional lifting that the film's script requires. As written by Plante, Nadia is a woman at constant war with her instincts, requiring a performer to find a way to wordlessly convey such tension on-screen. Savard mostly offers faraway stares, frequently looking lost and in need of micro-managed direction.\\" He concluded that the film \\"is not quite a medallist. But it's certainly a spirited contender.\\"Barry Hertz, \\"Quebecois swimming drama Nadia, Butterfly doesn't drown, but it doesn't place a gold medal, either\\". The Globe and Mail, September 16, 2020. Chris Knight of the National Post also concurred that the film's setting at an event that was cancelled in reality technically made it a science fiction movie, but praised Savard and the other non-professional actors in the cast for their naturalistic performances. He rated the film 4.5 stars out of five, concluding that \\"Nadia, Butterfly doesn‚Äôt feature any fireworks beyond the literal kind that mark those Games that never actually took place. But it doesn‚Äôt need to. The introspection and contemplative mood are all that is required to pull the viewer into this woman‚Äôs world.

He started his coaching career as an assistant coach with the Rockingham Flames Men's SBL team before being elevated to the head coaching role of the Flames Women's SBL team, where over 10 seasons he guided them to three grand finals and two championships while earning WSBL Coach of the Year honours. Between 2015 and 2020, he served as an assistant coach with the Lynx, and in 2019 and 2020, he served as head coach of the Flames men's team. Coaching careerRockingham Flames= In December 2008, Petrik was appointed head coach of the Rockingham Flames Women's SBL team for the 2009 season after spending the previous four years as an assistant coach with the Men's SBL team. As a rookie, he led the team to one of their best ever performances with a third-place finish and a 15‚Äì7 record with no imports and just one national league player. He subsequently re-signed with the Flames, and in 2010, the team had their best ever regular season as they finished in second place with a 16‚Äì6 record. After back-to-back quarter-final losses as the higher seed, the Flames went on to have their worst ever season in 2011 as they finished last with a 2‚Äì20 record. In 2012, Petrik guided the Flames back into the finals with a fourth-place finish and a 15‚Äì7 record. They went on to win through to the WSBL Grand Final to become the first Rockingham team (men or women) to reach a grand final. In the championship decider, the Flames were outclassed by the South West Slammers, losing 85‚Äì48. For the season, Petrik was named the WSBL Coach of the Year. In 2013, he guided the Flames to a semi- final appearance behind a second-place 16‚Äì6 regular season. In 2014, the Flames collected the club's first ever minor premiership with a first-place finish and a 20‚Äì2 record. They went on to reach the WSBL Grand Final after going undefeated over the first two rounds of the finals. In the championship decider, Petrik's one-two punch of Sami Whitcomb and Darcee Garbin saw them beat the Lakeside Lightning 80‚Äì75 to claim their maiden WSBL championship. In 2015, the Flames finished as minor premiers for the second straight year, once again with a 20‚Äì2 record. They made their way through to their third WSBL Grand Final in four years after going undefeated over the first two rounds of the finals. Behind a 41-point effort from Whitcomb, the Flames claimed back- to-back titles with a 68‚Äì63 win over the Willetton Tigers. In 2016, Petrik guided the Flames to a semi-final appearance behind a second-place 18‚Äì4 regular season. This was followed by a 2017 season that saw the Flames miss the finals with an 11th-place finish and a 6‚Äì16 record. Petrik's final season in charge of the Flames' women's team came in 2018, as they finished third with a 16‚Äì6 record before losing in the quarter-finals. In October 2018, Petrik was appointed head coach of the Flames Men's SBL team for the 2019 season. In his first season with the men's team, he led them to a fourth-place 18‚Äì8 regular season and a quarter-final appearance. He returned to the Flames in 2020 for the West Coast Classic. =Perth Lynx= In June 2015, Petrik was appointed an assistant coach to the Perth Lynx of the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) under Andy Stewart. In June 2020, after five seasons as an assistant, Petrik was appointed head coach of the Lynx on a two-year deal.

She advocates the cause of parents who lost a child as an infant, and may have had their child's remains inappropriately used for research, or disposed of, and without consent.  Birth and death of her son  At age 26, Reid gave birth to her a premature son, Gary Robert Paton, by Ceasarean section, on 26 June 1975. When he was six days old, he was transferred to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children (\\"Sick Kids\\") in Edinburgh for surgery to remove a catheter. The baby was placed on life support after surgery on 5 July, with reported brain damage. His parents agreed to a request by medical staff to terminate life support. He was briefly returned to life support by the hospital, but the hospital sent police to inform them that night that the child had died. A local funeral service showed her the child before burial, but she claims that the child they showed her was not her baby; Gary was smaller and had different hair colouring. The funeral staff denied this and argued that she was confused by post-partum depression. Reid would spend over 40 years investigating what happened to her child, publicly exposing the practice of hospitals in such situations.  Advocacy and reform  In 1999, a scandal erupted, and it was revealed that hospitals frequently took organ or other tissue samples from dead babies for research without parental consent. It was estimated that the organs or bodies of over 100,000 fetuses and stillbirths were being stored in medical labs, many either without any consent, or consent obtained in a way that rendered the parent unable to make an informed decision. Particularly intense scrutiny of Alder Hey hospital led to its chief pathologist being stripped of his license to practice medicine. News of the scandal prompted Reid to check with Sick Kids. She obtained medical records showing that his organs had been removed, despite assurances from the hospital to the contrary. Reid formed a network with other parents, called Justice for Innocents. Many of its members' requests for their children's medical records were responded to with redacted documents. Her efforts led authorities to form a review group. Its McLaren Report concluded that there were about 6,000 organs still being held, and that tighter regulations of the industry were needed. The parents sued for return of the organs. Many parents were successful (though sometimes it took as many as four separate returns), but not Reid, as the hospital insisted that none of the organs were stored. = Later developments = Eventually, Reid obtained a court order to exhume her son's body. Dame Susan Black performed the exhumation; she verified that it was the correct grave through artefacts found in it, but concluded that no body had been buried there. , Reid continues to press for information about her son and to get his organs returned to her for burial.

Prior to the Civil War and the Reconstruction Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, some blacks in the United States were given the right to vote, but this right was often abridged or taken away. After 1870, blacks were theoretically equal before the law, but in the period between the end of Reconstruction era and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 this was frequently infringed in practice. Background 1876 cartoon illustrating opposition to black suffrage At the founding of the country, blacks were not given citizenship or the right to vote. Early legal acts, like the Naturalization Act of 1790, granted naturalized citizenship to \\"free white person[s] ... of good character\\", thus excluding slaves, free blacks, Native Americans, indentured servants, and Asians. However, states were allowed to grant voting rights at the state level. Prior to the Civil War, free blacks had suffrage in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. However, the right to vote was rescinded in New Jersey (1807) and Pennsylvania (1838). During this time, Abolitionists sought an end to slavery, and many demanded further rights such as suffrage. The 1857 Dred Scott case held that persons of black descent were not U.S. citizens. After the Civil War, Reconstruction Era laws favored black suffrage, but in practice, blacks still faced obstacles to voting. Some of the \\"Black Codes\\" passed shortly after the legal abolition of slavery explicitly prevented blacks from voting. The Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, adopted in 1870, stipulated: \\"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\\" The Enforcement Acts increased federal penalties for voter intimidation, particularly by white terrorist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Blacks seeking suffrage were often met with violence and disenfranchisement. The 1873 Colfax massacre occurred when white locals fought with blacks and federal troops over black voting in Grant Parish, Louisiana. In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated some of the Enforcement Acts, ruling that the federal government could only intervene to prevent discrimination by state actors. In United States v. Reese (1876), the Court upheld voting requirements, such as literacy tests, which do not explicitly discriminate on the basis of race. Jim Crow laws enforcing legal racial segregation at the state and local level in the Southern United States were enacted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by white Democratic-dominated state legislatures to disenfranchise and remove political and economic gains made by blacks during the Reconstruction Era. Blacks continuously worked towards overcoming these barriers. A group of black activists formed the Niagara Movement in 1905, rebuking the Atlanta compromise and issuing a declaration that demanded universal manhood suffrage. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People formed in 1910 and pursued voting rights mostly through litigation. In Guinn v. United States (1915), the Supreme Court struck down a grandfather clause that functionally exempted only white people from literacy tests. The Court ruled against white primaries in Nixon v. Herndon (1927) and Nixon v. Condon (1932), upheld white primaries in Grovey v. Townsend (1935), and finally banned them with Smith v. Allwright (1944) and Terry v. Adams (1953). In Breedlove v. Suttles (1937), The Court upheld the constitutionality of a poll tax requirement for voting. The Civil Rights Movement brought renewed attention to black voting rights. Florida voting rights activists Harriette Moore and Harry T. Moore were assassinated by the KKK in 1951. In Gomillion v. Lightfoot (1960) the Supreme Court struck down a plan to redraw the district lines of Tuskegee, Alabama, on the grounds that it would disenfranchise black voters. The Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, passed in 1962‚Äì1964, banned poll taxes as a precondition for voting in federal elections. The Supreme Court ruled against state poll taxes in 1966 in Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections. Civil rights leaders began organized campaigns to register black voters, including the federally endorsed Voter Education Project. A particularly intense voting rights struggle in Mississippi led to the death of Medgar Evers in 1963 and the Freedom Summer campaign in 1964. Organizers also created the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party to challenge the white-dominated Mississippi Democratic Party. In Alabama, the highly publicized Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965 met with a violent response, bringing more scrutiny to suppression of black voters. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibited a range of discriminatory state voting practices. The Supreme Court upheld this law in the 1966 decision South Carolina v. Katzenbach. Since the 1960s, the practice of gerrymandering and the creation of \\"majority minority\\" districts have sometimes been identified as threats to black voting rights in the U.S. The Supreme Court limited the Gomillion decision in Mobile v. Bolden (1980), distinguishing between racist effects and racist intent, and prohibiting only the latter. The Court ruled in Shaw v. Reno (1993) that if a redistricting plan is \\"so bizarre on its face that it is 'unexplainable on grounds other than race, it must be held to a \\"strict scrutiny\\" standard under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court has since struck down redistricting plans for racial gerrymandering in Miller v. Johnson (1995), Bush v. Vera (1996), and several more cases.See: :Category:United States electoral redistricting case law The Supreme Court struck down part of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), holding that the racist practices that necessitated the law in 1965 no longer presented a problem in 2013. Black women's suffrage movement Banner with the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs' motto. Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture Black women began to work for political rights in the 1830s in New York and Philadelphia. Throughout the 19th century, black women like Harriet Forten Purvis, Mary Ann Shadd Cary, and Frances Ellen Watkins Harper worked on black civil rights, like the right to vote. Black women had to fight for racial equality, as well as women's rights. They were often marginalized because of their race and their gender. This led to the creation of groups like the National Association of Colored Women. Black women gained the legal right to vote with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920. With women gaining the vote, and the passage of the Civil Rights Act, black women became a powerful voting block.

It is the largest solar power plant of Nepal. The plant is owned by Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA). The solar panels are installed in six locations within the premises of Devighat Hydropower Station which is also owned by the NEA. Energy generated by the project is connected to the 66 kV sub-station of Devighat Hydropower Station. The solar station generates energy only during the daytime. The Chinese contractor Risen Energy Co.Risen Energy Co. Ltd., Tashan Industry Zone, Meilin, Street, Ninghai, Ningbo, China is involved in the operation and maintenance of the plant for the first five years. After that, the plant will be handed over to the NEA. Construction of the station began in 2018. Its targeted construction duration was one year, however there were delays due to environment studies. NEA had planned to install 15MW by April 2020 which was again delayed due to nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 2020, only 1.25 MW has been installed. The project cost is approximately NPR 4 billion which is funded by the government through NEA and concessional loan from the World Bank. The loan is a part of an agreement with the World Bank made in February 2015 to provide $130 million to the government of Nepal to build solar stations to supply electricity to the Kathmandu Valley. Out of the total amount, $37 million was allocated for this solar station. Controversy Although work on the solar plant should have begun within a year of signing the loan agreement with the World Bank, the NEA took around two years to award the contract as the entire contractor selection process due to controversy. Mukesh Raj Kafle, the director of NEA, unilaterally decided to hire a Chinese company to build the project. Kulman Ghising, the following director, decided to award the project to another Chinese contractor, Risen Energy Co., but the parliamentary committee invalidated the decision after receiving a complaint that the price of NPR 3.7 billion quoted by Raijin was NPR 680 million higher than the cost proposed by the contractor favoured by Kafle. The contractor was suspended by the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC). Later however, the Patan High Court reinstated the Chinese contractor.

Some platinum chelates are claimed to have antimicrobial activity.  Synthesis  Although the concept and practical use of metal chelation is common, chelation of inert metals, such as platinum, has been rarely reported and the yield was extremely low. To produce chelated platinum solution, tetraammonium EDTA, NTA, DTPA or HEDTA type chelating agent was mixed with platinum or platinum chemical compounds. The resulting chelated platinum would be in 4 forms: * EDTA: (i) (NH4)4-(EDTA)n‚Ä¢Pt, (ii) (NH4)4-n(EDTA‚Ä¢Pt), (iii) K4-n(EDTA‚Ä¢Pt) or (iv) K2-n(EDTA‚Ä¢Pt). * NTA: (i) (NH4)4-(NTA)n‚Ä¢Pt, (ii) (NH4)4-n(NTA‚Ä¢Pt), (iii) K4-n(NTA‚Ä¢Pt) or (iv) K2-n(NTA‚Ä¢Pt). * DTPA: (i) (NH4)4-(DTPA)n‚Ä¢Pt, (ii) (NH4)4-n(DTPA‚Ä¢Pt), (iii) K4-n(DTPA‚Ä¢Pt) or (iv) K2-n(DTPA‚Ä¢Pt). * HEDTA: (i) (NH4)4-(HEDTA)n‚Ä¢Pt, (ii) (NH4)4-n(HEDTA‚Ä¢Pt), (iii) K4-n(HEDTA‚Ä¢Pt) or (iv) K2-n(HEDTA‚Ä¢Pt). The core technique was the usage of a bridge-type heterogeneous chelation architecture to capture metal in a stable water-soluble state. Surprisingly, platinum ion in this particular multi-phase bridged chelated state is amazingly stable. Chelated platinum solution is in the form of high energy dielectric aqueous solution. Silver, platinum and gold are best known precious metals. However, from a more comprehensive and chemistry point of view, they should be described as inert metals. Inert metals are very stable. They are difficult to participate directly in ordinary acid-base reactions and turn into metal compounds. Therefore, they can stay alone in the form of single element in nature. To turn silver, platinum and gold into metal complex, it can only be performed in very special and particular reaction environment. Furthermore, it is much more difficult to make inert metals into its chelated form which is stable in acidic and basic conditions. The critical reason is that it should undergo a treatment process that involve a great amount of energy in order to achieve a water-soluble state.  Antimicrobial and antiviral properties  Generally, it is not a simple process to turn an inert precious metal directly into its water-soluble ionic state. Material under high energy treatment would gain certain amount of energy according to energy storage effect. Therefore, when inert metal directly turns into its ionic water-soluble state under high energy treatment, it is certain that this aqueous solution would possess large amount of energy. Due to the high energy state and dielectric properties of platinum metal ion in chelated state, the energy conversion at the contact point between platinum ion and bacteria, which is similar to the situation of electrical short circuit, would lead to cell burst and trigger bactericidal effect. Furthermore, platinum ion in chelated state is much more stable than ordinary metal ion in aqueous solution. Also, the concentration and density of chelated platinum ion can be freely adjusted, this characteristic provides effective concentration for anti-microbial and anti-viral activity. Besides, platinum is known to be the best catalyst in the world. The concept of catalyst is that on one hand it triggers catalyzing and reversible reactions, but on the other hand, it does not involve directly in the chemical reaction. Thus, during the microbial eliminating process, there is no deterioration in chelated platinum ion content, such that the bactericidal effective can be continued and sustainable. Besides the effect surface energy, it is also speculated that the antimicrobial and antiviral properties of platinum would involve the following aspects. Same as other antimicrobial and antiviral metal ions, such as silver, gold, and copper platinum ion is also positively charged. Based on the chemical characteristics, the surface of either Gram- positive and Gram-negative bacteria is negatively charged Meanwhile, similar surface characteristics could be found in fungi and enveloped virus. The positively charged platinum ions would be attracted by the negatively charged cell surface through electrostatic interaction and involved in electron transfer. With the destabilization of cell membrane, change in membrane potential, pH and local conductivity, the permeability of the membrane would be significantly increased, leading to the rupture of microbe or virus outer membrane layer. Furthermore, some functional group of proteins might bind to metal ion that would cause protein denaturation. Eventually cell death or disruption of virus structure would be triggered. Apart from the structural damage of membrane, metal ions also contribute to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside the cell. ROS would oxidize glutathione, which is vital compound in bacteria carry out antioxidant defense system to combat against ROS. Consequently, the cell would be destructed due to the reduction of intracellular ATP level, cellular enzyme denaturation, interruption of protein synthesis and DNA damage contributed by the oxidative stress or direct interaction with the metal ion. Since the interaction of metal ion with some atoms, such as nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, which are abundant in most cellular biomolecules, is very strong and non-specific, therefore, metal ion could possess a broad spectrum of antimicrobial property.  Safety  Regarding safety concern, platinum cannot be absorbed by the body. Platinum has widely been used in numerous kinds of medical implants, such as dental alloys, aneurysm coils, medical device electrodes, coronary stents and catheters. Allergy of platinum metal in human has rarely been reported. Only platinum compounds which possess labile leaving groups coordinated to platinum, such as complex halogenated platinum salts or cisplatin, show hypersensitivity and/or toxicity to human. Since the chelated platinum ion is tightly bound to the chelating agent in the form of macromolecule, therefore, toxicity problem would not be an issue. Silver, platinum and gold are best known precious metals. However, from a more comprehensive and chemistry point of view, they should be described as inert metals. Inert metals are very stable. They are difficult to participate directly in ordinary acid-base reactions and turn into metal compounds. Therefore, they can stay alone in the form of single element in nature. To turn silver, platinum and gold into metal complex, it can only be performed in very special and particular reaction environment. Furthermore, it is much more difficult to make inert metals into its chelated form which is stable in acidic and basic conditions. The critical reason is that it should undergo a treatment process that involve a great amount of energy in order to achieve a water-soluble state.

The inaugural exhibition included works by Stuart Brisley, Gustave Metzger, and Marc Camille Chaimowicz. Having himself been appointed by the German cultural attach√© to London, Sigi Krauss brought in as co-director Rosetta Brooks, then an undergraduate student at the University College London, who took an active role in the Gallery's programming. The exhibition format Krauss and Brooks adopted was loose, with no set open hours, no compensation for staff, no entry charge, and no censorship of artists. Within this framework, Gallery House staged exhibitions that gained critical attention, including some of the earliest recorded shows of ‚Äòexpanded cinema‚Äô, new film, and video work. Among them were Brooks' ambitious, influential three-part Survey of the Avant-Garde in Britain which included British video artist David Hall's first multiscreen installation, and Marc Camille Chaimowicz' career-making Celebration? Realife, in which the artist filled the House's ballroom with party lights, disco detritus, and found objects, invited viewers to discuss the work over coffee in the adjacent gallery, and slept in the building at night for the exhibition's duration. Documents from Gallery House, including meeting minutes, diaries, correspondence, artifacts and audio-visual resources, are held by the Tate Gallery Archive, along with material from Sigi Krauss Gallery and the later Artists Meeting Place space. = Contemporary Interest = In 2006, the Centre of Attention curatorial collective organized Fast and Loose: My Dead Gallery, an exhibition at Fieldgate Gallery in London that celebrated defunct alternative art exhibition spaces in London, prominently including Gallery House. The exhibition drew attention from leading art journals, appearing on top-ten-of-the-year lists by then-Tate Modern film curator Stuart Comer in Frieze, and by Whitney Museum curator Chrissie Iles in Artforum, who wrote that these spaces \\"nurtured an alternative practice that has remained largely invisible due to its ephemerality, yet were enormously important for the development of artists\\". In 2017, curators Antony Hudek and Alex Sainsbury mounted This Way Out of England: Gallery House in Retrospect at Raven Row, an exhibition in which artists who had shown at Gallery House were invited to reenact or rethink their interventions in the space.

It is not only a restorative process, but also social and emotional integration of people with locomotor disorders. At the core of ExoRehabilitation lies combined application of medical exoskeleton with other methods, such as exercise therapy or physiotherapy. ExoRehabilitation increases muscle strength and stamina, improves stability and functional balance, reduces spasticity, normalizes blood pressure, aids digestion and urination. The patients‚Äô psychological state goes through notably positive changes: thanks to the social aspect of rehabilitation the level of depression is reduced, they feel more self-assured about the future and realize that they are not limited by their condition. Stages of ExoRehabilitation ExoRehabilitation begins in a hospital at the first stage of rehabilitation, after the patient‚Äôs condition has stabilized; at the second and third stages the procedure changes: sessions are conducted on an outpatient basis several times a week at medical facilities or social protection agencies. The patients who are unable to visit a hospital may choose to train at home under supervision of a mobile team. Every time a foot hits the ground, it sends signals to the brain. The exoskeleton helps to follow the natural gait and therefore stimulates the restoration of sensitivity and independent walking. The quality of life and the will to live increase dramatically. A patient wants to become healthy and be more integrated into society. The aim of gait restoration is to enable the person to walk again - even if he has to use compensatory strategies. Gait rehabilitation focuses on recovery of gait - the aim is that the patient \\"relearns\\" to walk - if possible without help.

He was awarded the Navy Cross during the Korean War and later became the first Marine lawyer general officer.  Early life and career  James F. Lawrence was born on March 17, 1918, in Rutledge, Tennessee. Upon graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1941, he enlisted in the Marine Corps. Lawrence was assigned as a platoon leader in the 1st Marine Division during World War II. He took part in the Guadalcanal campaign in 1942, and after liberty in Australia, he led his platoon in the battle of Cape Gloucester in December 1943. Lawrence returned to the United States in 1944 with several awards including the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. Lawrence then briefly took Asian studies and Japanese language courses at Yale University. He then took part in the occupations of Japan and China for three years following the end of World War II.  Korean War  When the Korean War started, Major Lawrence was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division as the operations officer. He took part in the amphibious assault at Inchon and the subsequent recapture of Seoul in September 1950. At the conclusion of the Inchon-Seoul campaign, the entire 1st Marine Division embarked on Navy ships and sailed around South Korea, landing at Wonsan in October. The division then marched 70 miles north to the Chosin Reservoir area. As the Marines arrived at Chosin Reservoir, the Chinese Communist military encircled the entire division and the coldest winter in 50 years descended on Korea. Temperatures fell as low as ‚àí35 ¬∞F as a blizzard swept the area. By late November, the Marines were forced to fight their way through the Chinese in order to withdraw to the south. During the withdrawal from Hagaru-ri to Koto- ri, Major Lawrence's battalion was assigned as the division vanguard. On December 6, Lawrence voluntarily led a small group behind the forward assault platoon, despite continuous enemy fire and shells which exploded in close proximity to him, in order to coordinate the advance and direct fire. During the first four miles of the advance, Lawrence effectively directed the destruction of three Chinese roadblocks. Major Lawrence's battalion commander succumbed to combat fatigue and the executive officer was seriously wounded, leaving Lawrence as the senior Marine officer. He unhesitatingly took command of his battalion and led his Marines in smashing through the last roadblocks outside of Koto-ri for the next few hours. Lawrence then led his Marines back to continue fighting and assist the rest of the division in reaching Koto-ri. For his bravery during the battle, Lawrence was awarded the Navy Cross and a second Bronze Star.  Later Marine Corps career  After returning to the United States, Lawrence attended law school at George Washington University. Upon graduating in 1953, he served as a legal advisor to the Commandant at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. Lawrence was then assigned to Marine Forces Pacific as a senior legal officer. In May 1967, Lawrence became the first Marine lawyer to be promoted to brigadier general. He was then given a nonlegal assignment as the Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs, which included being The Pentagon's primary liaison with Congress. The Office of the Secretary of Defense would not release Lawrence from his position despite Headquarters Marine Corps' efforts to have Lawrence command the Judge Advocate Division. Brigadier General Lawrence retired from the Marines in November 1968. However, he was recalled to active duty to continue serving as the Deputy Assistant before he retired a second time in 1972. Lawrence was awarded two Navy Distinguished Service Medals for his services as the Deputy Assistant.  Post-Marine career and life  For the next 20 years following his retirement, Lawrence continued to practice law in Springfield, Virginia. In 1979, he helped found the Marine Corps Heritage Foundation. James F. Lawrence died of pneumonia on September 18, 2006, at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

Born in Leipzig, Mohs became a woodturner, and joined the Union of Woodturners of Germany. From 1889, he chaired its Leipzig branch. In 1893, the Woodturners merged with several other unions, to form the German Woodworkers' Union. He opposed this, and soon afterwards lost his job. He found work as a journalist on the Leipziger Volkszeitung, and also served as president of the Leipzig trades council. In 1898, Mohs moved to Berlin, where he helped form a union representing butchers. From 1900, he was the editor of the union newspaper, Fleischer, then in 1902, he began working full-time in the office of the Union of Municipal and State Workers (VGS). The union's membership among gas workers had fallen dramatically, but Mohs was able to reverse this. He then spent the first half of 1903 editing the union's newspaper, and in April was appointed as one of five members of the union's executive. He was given responsibility for constructing a new union headquarters, in Leipzig, and was appointed as regional secretary for most of southern Germany, developing new branches in the Rhineland. In 1905, Mohs was appointed as vice president of the union, and also secretary to its executive board. At the end of 1905, he became acting president, when Bruno Poersch resigned, and in April 1906, he was elected to the office on a permanent basis. In contrast to Poersch, he was willing to make concessions in demarcation disputes with other unions, something which proved controversial within the VGS. Mohs also championed the formation of an international trade secretariat to represent public sector workers. He organised a conference in 1907 which formed the International Secretariat of the Workers in Public Services (PSI), and he became its general secretary. Under Mohs' leadership, the VGS grew, recruiting new members, and also persuading some local unions to join. However, he remained unpopular with the union's board, and in 1909, he was defeated in a vote for re-election by Richard Heckmann, 26 votes to 25. Because of the closeness of the vote, Heckmann refused to take up the post, and Mohs remained in office. At the next vote, in 1912, he defeated Emil Wutzky only by 43 votes to 42. Mohs was also active in the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), serving as vice president of its Sch√∂neberg branch from 1910 to 1913, and unsuccessfully standing for Sch√∂neberg City Council in 1910. In 1913, he won election to the Greater Berlin council. By 1914, the PSI had sufficient funds to pay for a full-time general secretary. Mohs was given the role, standing down as leader of the VGS, allowing Heckmann to take over. With the outbreak of World War I soon afterwards, Heckmann argued that the PSI should be abolished, and Mohs could return to his old post as leader of the union's southern district. However, Mohs persuaded a majority of PSI affiliates to support the federation's continued existence. In February 1915, Mohs suffered a heart attack, and spent the remainder of the year recuperating. With the PSI no longer able to pay a full-time salary, he filled the role part-time, and also became editor of the Correspondenzblatts der Generalkommission der Gewerkschaften Deutschlands and the Gewerkschaftlichen Frauenzeitung. The VGS left the PSI at the start of 1917, but Mohs remained in post, and persuaded the union to rejoin in 1919. He then retired from the international position, and won election as a district councillor in Sch√∂neberg, with responsibility for the local employment office. He retired at the start of 1925, and died in March from heart failure.

In 1912 she played Gringoire in her husband's adaptation The King and the Vagabond at the Kingsway Theatre. The couple were on a tour of first Australia and then North America from 1912 to 1914. Their biggest success on the tour was Laurence Irving's own play The Typhoon which was a topical play set in the time of the Russo-Japanese War, in which he played a Japanese officer. Death Colourized photo of Empress of Ireland At the end of the tour they were returning home when Laurence and Mabel Irving drowned in the RMS Empress of Ireland disaster. In the early hours of the morning on 29 May 1914, near the mouth of the St. Lawrence River, the Empress of Ireland was rammed by the , a Norwegian collier, on her starboard bow. Storstad remained afloat, but Empress of Ireland was severely damaged. A gaping hole in her side caused the lower decks to flood at a rate alarming to the crew. Empress of Ireland lurched heavily to starboard. Most of the passengers and crew located in the lower decks drowned quickly and water entered through open portholes, some only a few feet above the water line, and inundated passageways and cabins. Those berthed in the upper decks were awakened by the collision, and immediately boarded lifeboats on the boat deck. Within a few minutes of the collision, the list was so severe that the port lifeboats could not be launched. Some passengers attempted to do so but the lifeboats just crashed into the side of the ship, spilling their occupants into the frigid water. Five starboard lifeboats were launched successfully, while a sixth capsized during lowering. *Report reprinted in the UK as command paper Cd. 7609 (HMSO 1914), p. 19. Ten or eleven minutes after the collision, Empress of Ireland lurched violently onto her starboard side, allowing as many as 700 passengers and crew to crawl out of the portholes and decks onto her port side. The ship lay on her side for a minute or two, having seemingly run aground. A few minutes later at 02:10, about 14 minutes after the collision, the bow rose briefly out of the water and the ship finally sank. Hundreds of people were thrown into the near- freezing water. The disaster resulted in the deaths of 1,012 people. Reports in the news accounts of the tragedy say that Laurence Irving and Mabel Hackney got separated and Irving was in a position of temporary safety, but he knew Mabel could not swim and he jumped back into the water to rescue her. Their bodies were never found. In her will Mabel Lucy Irving left ¬£5,761 3s 11d to her widowed mother, who presumably was raising her orphaned children.England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858‚Äì1995 for Mabel Lucy Irving: 1914 ‚Äì Ancestry.com {[subscription}} See also *Irving family ReferencesExternal links *Portraits of Mabel Lucy Hackney ‚Äì National Portrait Gallery, London Category:1872 births Category:1914 deaths Category:Actresses from Swansea Category:19th-century English actresses Category:20th-century English actresses Category:English Shakespearean actresses Category:Broadway actors Category:Women of the Victorian era Category:Deaths due to shipwreck Category:People lost at sea Category:Accidental deaths in Quebec ","title":"Mabel Hackney"},{"id":"64182195","text":"Pandor is a surname.

The book was written over 9 years, and during the last 4 years the author was confined in his neighbourhood due to the eruption of the Yemeni Civil War. Covering the history of Arabs from their first known mention in 853 BD up to the present, the book uses Arabic language as a unifying factor to tell the story. Arabs was met with dozens of reviews and mentiones, the vast majority of them favorable. Background Tim Mackintosh-Smith is an Arabist, traveller and Arabic translator. He is a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland and an emeritus Senior Fellow of the New York University Library of Arabic Literature. He views himself as a post-orientalist. In his early twenties, he received a degree in Arabic from the University of Oxford. Afterwhich he moved to Yemen. He considers Yemen his adoptive country and has lived there for over 35 years. He speaks Arabic fluently, with a Yemeni accent. His house in the capital Sanaa is a \\"medieval tower\\". Mackintosh-Smith wrote several travel books including one about Yemen and a trilogy associated with Moroccan explorer Ibn Battuta, which earned him the 1998 Thomas Cook Travel Book Award, the 2010 Oldie Best Travel Award and the 2010 Ibn Battutah Prize of Honour. The BBC produced a television series about his journey following the footsteps of Ibn Battuta. In 2009 Mackintosh-Smith was commissioned by Yale University Press to write the book, although he initially declined the task, because it was \\"too much work\\". He estimated it would take him 5 years, but eventually it took him about 9 years. The Yemeni Civil War (2015‚Äìpresent) confined him in his neighbourhood for more than 4 years. It was during this time of \\"neighbourhood arrest\\", with mortar shells and missiles falling around, and daily reverberating chants of \\"Death to America\\" that he wrote Arabs. Due to the total power cut in Yemen during the war, the author used a solar panel powered laptop to write the book. Since late 2019, Mackintosh-Smith has been staying in Kuala Lumpur. The book cover was designed by Alex Kirby. The choice to use gold foil patterns was meant to give it the look of \\"the definitive volume on the subject\\". Kirby said the inspiration for the cover came after he had went through \\"dozens of books and sites featuring Islamic calligraphy, patterns and motifs\\". The cover design was chosen for the Association of American University Presses 2020 Book, Jacket, and Journal Show. The audiobook is read by Ralph Lister and is 25 hours 34 minutes long. Content The United Arab States was a short-lived confederation of the United Arab Republic (Egypt and Syria) and North Yemen from 1958 to 1961. The title of the book refers to Arabs without using the definite article \\"the\\" (Arabs instead of the Arabs) because, according to the author, the meaning of the word has repeatedly changed over time, making it \\"misleading\\" to use. The subtitle is partly inspired by Quranic verse 49:13: \\"O mankind, We have created you from male and female, and made you into peoples and tribes, that you may know one another. [emphasis added]\\". In addition to the foreword, introduction and afterword, the book is divided into six main parts that cover the three main \\"waves of unity\\" of recorded Arab history with each taking about the same number of pages. The first wave (900 BC to AD 630) contains parts on \\"Emergence\\" and \\"Revolution\\", the second (630 to 1350) contains \\"Dominance\\" and \\"Decline, and the third (1350 to now) covers \\"Eclipse\\" and \\"Re-emergence\\". The books opens in the foreword by asking a central question that would form the main theme of its thesis, namely about the causes of Arab unity and disunity. The author highlights the ambiguity associated with defining the meaning of the term \\"Arab\\" and notes the importance of Classical Arabic language in uniting this ethnic group, and thus the need to study its history. He considers language to be the \\"defining feature\\" of Arabs, calling them \\"arabophones\\" and referring to the Arab world as the \\"Arabic world\\". He emphasizes the importance of studying Arab history from the beginning, with the first mention of them in 853 BC, rather than from the rise of Islam as Albert Hourani did. At the time of writing this section in 2017, the time between then and the year 582 when, according to Islamic tradition, Muhammad, still a boy, was first recognized as prophet is exactly the same as between that and 853 BC (1435 years), meaning the rise of Islam lies in the middle rather than beginning of Arab history. Starting from the beginning is necessary in order to \\"de-islamize\\" and \\"re-arabize\\" the history of Arabs. =Emergence 900 BC - 600 AD= The first definitely known mention of Arabs in history dates to 853 BC in an Assyrian text which mentiones a man named Gindibu who is an Arab chieftain that owned 1,000 camles and helped King Shalmaneser III defeat his enemies. Arabs were marginal compared to Babylonians, Assyrians, Persians and Romans in the north and Sabaeans in the south. The Sabaeans and other South Arabian people did not speak Arabic, rather their language group is Old South Arabian, which is as different from Arabic as German is from Italian. The abundance of Arabic dialects suggests the language was not unified at the time, and that Arabs were a mixed group genetically and linguistically which is one possible etymology for the word Arab. [T]here was no such thing as Arabic, singular; rather there were ‚Äì and still are ‚Äì many Arabics. ‚ÄòArabic‚Äô was never a neatly espaliered sub-branch of Semitic or a homogenous collection of shoots, but a gnarled and multiply engrafted outgrowth bearing some very old and very odd features. The very diversity of the ‚Äòdialect bundle‚Äô that became Arabic reflects the sense of ‚Äôarab as a mixed bunch, a genetic and linguistic omnium gatherum, and one that had been absorbing new members regularly from very early times. Reviews Arabs received dozens of reviews and mentiones, the vast majority of them favorable. =Favorable= In a review published in The Guardian, Ian Black spoke favorably of the book, citing different passages that span the centuries of Arab history. He was particulary fascinated by the author's ability to combine \\"deep learning with penetrating insights delivered with dazzling turns of phrase and illuminating comparisons\\". He praised Mackintosh- Smith's use of analogies between past and present, which in addition to the attention paid to details helped to forge a \\"richly detailed chronicle of Arab language and culture\\". Steve Donoghue of The National reviewed it favorably, describing it as \\"a thoroughly remarkable achievement\\". While he found the first part of the book \\"haphazard\\" due to the gaps in documentation of early Arab history, the subsequent parts starting from the rise of Islam were \\"more readable\\". \\"[T]he bulk of this astounding book portrays grand personalities, national journeys and thrilling adventures, all seen through the prism of Arabic language,\\" he added. Donoghue also wrote for Open Letters Review where he listed Arabs as one of the best 2019 history books and described it as \\"immersive\\". In the New Statesman, Shiraz Maher called the book \\"extraordinary\\", noting its \\"original and interesting\\" use of the Arabic Language to chronicle the history of Arabs. He also praised it for avoiding Islamo-centrism in that it gave equal coverage to Arab history before, during and after the advent of Islam. Of particular interest to Maher was the author's direct addressing of modern controversial topics. The book was hailed as an excellent source for experts and non-experts alike. In The Spectator, Anthony Sattin referred to the book as \\"magisterial\\", \\"brilliant\\" and \\"important\\", emphasizing many of the same highlights as Maher. He added that Mackintosh-Smith is a \\"worthy successor\\" to historians Philip Hitti, Albert Hourani and Eugene Rogan who wrote influential works about Arab history. Sattin added: [Arabs] is a book of vast scope and stunning insight, which manages to discuss even the seemingly intractable issues between Sunnis and Shi‚Äôah and the intricacies of Arabic with a light touch, an easy style and a telling detail. Language emerges as the key to Arab identity, so it is not by chance that there are more entries for Arabic in the index than for anything else. Another reviewer who compared Mackintosh-Smith to Albert Hourani was Robert Irwin. Writing for Literary Review, he said that Arabs was even more remarkable than Hourani's \\"great study\\" A History of the Arab Peoples. Irwin found the author's coverage of the Pre-Islamic era unusual, and his focus on the influece of ancient Arab Kingdoms over Islam as \\"careful and original\\". He added: [Arabs] is a passionate and highly original meditation on Arab history in which etymological insights, snippets of poetry and historical anecdotes (a large number of which are apocryphal) are used to shed light on the Arabs‚Äô past and their uncertain future [...] Although Mackintosh-Smith's book is perfectly scholarly, it is not a dutiful plod through a succession of slaughtered sultans and viziers or a tallying of gains and losses in forgotten battles in unpronounceable places. On the contrary, Arabs keeps throwing out brilliant insights, like sparks from a Catherine wheel. Robert Irwin also wrote for the The Times Literary Supplement where he listed the book as his favorite for 2019 and described it as \\"exhilarating\\" despite its melancholic conclusions. The Penang Institute, which hosted an event for the author, said the book was \\"widely acknowledged to be the best single- volume history of the Arabs in the English language\\". During the event, Gareth Richards described the book as a \\"really superlative book\\". \\"It's really a book that betrays tremendous knowledge, mastering a huge range of sources. It's written very compellingly, beautifully erudite, and [...] it's also very very witty [...] it's really history at its best,\\" he added. Noting that it took the author 9 years to write, he called it his magnum opus. In a brief review, Kirkus Reviews described the book as \\"[a] marvelous journey brimming with adventure and poetry and narrated by a keen, compassionate observer\\". Another short review was written by Jon Grand for The Book Stall Newsletter where he described the book as essential for understanding Arabs. Listed in the The Evening Standard's best summer holiday reads for 2019, Arabs was described as an \\"erudite study\\" that \\"was worth the wait\\". It was also listed by The Bookseller as Editor's Choice for history where it was described as an \\"extraordinarily comprehensive history of the Arabs and their culture\\". In Open, Keerthik Sasidharan listed Arabs as one of the 4 best books he read in 2019. He described it as a \\"marvel of lucidity\\" and \\"a lesson in how to be scholarly without being pedantic, on how to think about history\\". To him, Mackintosh-Smith is a \\"patient lover\\" who explores obscure parts of the vast Arab world and history. Tufts University listed the book in their 2020 Summer Books Recommendations, with Taylor McNeil describing it as a \\"magisterial book\\" that is \\"always clever, witty, and erudite\\". He expressed his sadness for finishing the book, and vowed to reread it. \\"[T]his is no rote recounting of history, but a deep and compelling take on who the Arabs are‚Äîand are not‚Äîand on the constant tension between unification of the Arabs as a people and their inevitable conflict and dissolution,\\" he added. In The Irish Times, Darragh Geraghty listed the audiobook version of Arabs as one of 35 best listens during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. He described it as surprisingly engaging, and praised its focus on Arabic culture and language rather than Islam. The Boston Athen√¶um also recommended reading the book. Jamil Sherif of Salaam hailed the book as a \\"masterpiece of historical explanation\\" and \\"monumental work of scholarship and erudition\\", emphasizing the author's sense of humour and ability to link past and present. In The British-Yemeni Society Journal, Noel Brehony reviewed the book favorably. He mentioned that Arabs \\"has been widely praised\\" and cited a passage from Ian Black's review in The Guardian. Viewing it as the successor to Hourani's book on the same topic, he praised the book's use of words to \\"enlighten, entertain and inspire\\". He added: [Arabs] is a formidable piece of scholarship but told using anecdote, quotation, striking and original analogy and parallels between the past and the present to make it a joy to read. This reviewer, though at first daunted by its length, found himself drawn in and eager to spend an hour daily enjoying the author's erudition, command of the sources ‚Äì historical as well as literary, prose as well as poetry ‚Äì and brilliant turn of phrase. It is comprehensive and the subject matter complex, but he makes it utterly comprehensible. Justin Marozzi reviewed the book favorably in The Sunday Times. He said Arabs was a rare \\"combination of commanding erudition and swashbuckling prose\\". \\"[Mackintosh-Smith] writes with wonderful verve. Idioms and irreverence abound,\\" he added. Marozzi nevertheless was mildy critical of the editing, \\"[u]ndoubtedly brilliant, his book might have benefited from a sharper editorial knife,\\" he explained. He encouraged readers to buy the book to support the author as he, according to his website, was \\"impecunious\\". Arabs was listed in The Sunday Times best history books for 2019 where it was described as \\"sumptuous\\" and written with \\"infectious enthusiasm\\". Writing for The Times (sister paper of The Sunday Times), Richard Spencer made a similar note to Marozzi regarding the book's need for more editing. Nevetheless his review was also favorable, describing Arabs as a \\"sweeping book\\" that employs \\"meticulous scholarship\\" and \\" addresses vital questions of Arab identity and nationhood\\". He also praised the author, attributing to him \\"nearmythical status among western observers of the Middle East\\". In the Financial Times, Malise Ruthven said the book was \\"an entertaining and absorbing history that manages to be far-reaching and erudite yet conversational in style\\". He noted the author's focus on Arabic language and military strategy as a unique combination that helped Arab expansion during the early era of Islam. Eric Ormsby reviewed the book favorably for The Wall Street Journal, praising it for extending coverage of Arab history to pre-Islamic era, which he found original. Ormsby went on to praise the style of the author, noting his ability to make sense of otherwise complex and confusing events through the use of dramatic anecdotes and concepts such as asabiyyah and wheel of fire. Although the book received only praise, Ormsby found \\"occational lapses\\", citing the book's omission of the Saqifah, which he argued deserved more attention even though the book was not about history of Islam. Writing for The Times Literary Supplement, Christian Sahner favorably reviewed the book, describing it as \\"excellent\\". He noted that the greatest strength of the book was its focus on Arabic language. Like Sherif and Richards, he found the humour appealing, he said: Humour is a great hallmark of the book, employed especially for frequent comparisons between things medieval and modern. For example, while explaining the decline of the Arab bluebloods of the Abbasid period and the simultaneous rise of a highly mixed, cosmopolitan society around them, he notes: ‚ÄúTo be an Arab in ninth-century Baghdad was not unlike being a WASP in twenty-first- century New York: important to oneself, perhaps, but increasingly irrelevant to the demography of ‚ÄòBaghdad on the Subway‚Äô‚Äù. Sahner however was mildly critical of the author for missing historically influential groups such as Arab Christians and Arab Jews. In The American Conservative, John C. McKay hailed the book as a \\"magisterial survey\\" and a \\"major tour de force\\", and praised the author's \\"scholarly erudition and limpid prose [that] elucidates and illuminates an immensely difficult, nuanced, and complex subject with absolute brilliance\\". He lamented that the book was not published before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In another review by McKay, this time published in Crossroads of the Corps, he described Arabs as \\"superb\\" and one of the rare magisterial works on Arab history that are written in English. The Washington BookReview praised the book, describing it as \\"brilliant and fascinating\\". \\"Arabs is a much-needed addition to the existing literature on Arab history and language that provides new perspectives and insights,\\" it added. In a review for History Today, Barnaby Rogerson lavished praise upon the book. Noting the difficult circumstances in which it was written, he compared Mackintosh-Smith to Fernand Braudel, who wrote The Mediterranean during World War II. Rogerson also compared him to both Herodotus and Al-Masudi for his \\"all-encompassing and recklessly discursive enthusiasm\\". He added: Arabs is a dazzling achievement, born of a historian's passionate affection for his subject. It is a labour of love, achieved after a lifetime spent in Arabia [...] It is on [the] delicate knife-edge between the impact of language and political history that Mackintosh-Smith is at his most original and innovative as a historian. I have read dozens of narrative histories of the Arabs, but I have never felt so transported, so entertained and so immersed. Rogerson also wrote for Country Life, recommending Arabs for history enthusiasts and calling it \\"a dazzling, virtuoso chronicle of 3,000 years of Arabic achievement\\". In the Claremont Review of Books, Barnaby Crowcroft described Mackintosh-Smith as \\"the most interesting author to grapple with his subject matter in a generation\\", partly due to his resistance to romantic notions of Arab unity. He particularly found the similarity drawn by the author between Arab nationalism and Islamism insightful for it showed that Formal Arabic (which is not spoken as a mother tongue) was the shared fulcrum that rendered both movements essnetially \\"backward-looking\\". Crowcroft also found the author's presentation of the Arabic language as one of the Wonders of the World both powerful and refreshing. Denyse Woods, who described herself as a friend and big fan of the author, called the book magnificent. She predicted that it would be on bookshelves for hundreds of years and receive wide readership through the ages. Reviewing it for the The Jerusalem Post, Seth J. Frantzman found the book fascinating, especially the chapters on the pre-Islamic period. He noted that writing a book on the whole history of a people is a daunting task, but one that Mackintosh-Smith was able to accomplish nevertheless. \\"Arabs is an accessible and readable account of a complex and long history. It is so full of storytelling and blending of peoples and culture that it surmounts the challenge of trying to tell so much history in one volume,\\" he said. In a review for Commonweal, Patrick Ryan praised the book for being \\"extraordinarily learned and perceptive\\", and named the author \\"the Ibn Battutah of the twenty-first century\\". He drew attention to the title of the book, \\"Arabs\\" rather than \\"the Arabs\\", adding that this \\"holds the key to its significance\\". Ryan was particularly fascinated by the author's use of parallels between past and present, citing the comparison between Al-Hallaj and Mahmoud Mohammed Taha. Separated by a millennium, both men were executed for their religious views. Prince Hassan bin Talal praised the book profusely, describing it as a \\"breath of fresh air\\". He added: [Arabs] will I hope go some way to dispelling the mistaken notion that all that is progressive originated in one quarter of the globe [...] Your retelling of the highs and lows of three millennia gives a true insight into the essence of Arab existence [...] As such it is my profound hope that it will go somehow to providing a counterbalance to the hatred industry, offering as it does insight into and respect for the other [...] Your book is also a gloriously enjoyable read and above all highlights not that which separates, but that which we share, our common heritage and our common humanity. =Mixed= In a mixed review for History: Reviews of New Books, Alexander Shelby described the book as a \\"valuable and well-researched study of Arab history\\" that is \\"thought-provoking\\". He said that few claims in the book are not backed by evidence, citing the author's assersion that Arabs may trace their origin to the Fertile Crescent. He also thought that some passages had an orientalist taint to them such as the statement that Arabic language has a particular ability for \\"mass manipulation of truth\\". In another mixed review, Max Rodenbeck described Arabs for The New York Review of Books as \\"unusual\\", \\"erudite and discursive\\". He said the book was not \\"quite a history\\" as its title suggests, but something else. He explained: [R]ather than retelling the long Arab saga in full or raising quibbles with academic historians who have covered this broad sweep, such as Philip Hitti or Albert Hourani, Mackintosh-Smith sets out instead to fill in the gaps they left, to embellish the tale in bolder colors, and to arrange it in a more attractive and revealing way. He is not so much a chronicler as an engaging curator, guiding readers around a fascinating exhibition, pointing out lesser- known objects, and casting new light on burnished masterpieces. He added that this style of the book led to some inevitable omissions, citing several topics from the pre-Islamic history such as Philip the Arab, Zenobia, Ghassanids and Nabataeans. He had expected this era to receive more attention, especially since the author noted that Muhammad's message lay in the middle, not beginning of Arab history. Rodenbeck nevertheless concluded that book is \\"reward[ing] in so many other ways\\" and went on to explain many of the same points mentioned by favorable reiviews. In Asian Affairs, Alan Mackie descrbied Arabs as \\"ambitious\\", \\"discursive and fascinating\\". While he found the author's telling of history proficient, he nevertheless criticized him for not producing any \\"special insights\\" or speculations about the future of the Arab world and Arab identity. =Critical= Reviewing it for The Irish Times, Richard Pine said the book was \\"sad\\" and called it a \\"paradoxical study\\". He was critical of Mackintosh-Smith's criticism of Israel, which he characterized as unbalanced. He also criticized the book for being narrow, citing its omission of wider context, inadequate coverage of The Copts, and its lack of any mention of some important works on Arabic history and literature. He was also critical of the way endnotes were organized, describing them as \\"so impenetrable as to disaffect the enquiring reader\\". Lawrence Rosen reviewed the book for The Marginalia Review of Books. He contrasted Bernard Lewis's approach which asked What Went Wrong? with that of Mackintosh-Smith which presented disunity as a pattern that repeats itself throughout Arab History. Rosen questioned the author's focus on language and Arab unity, saying it \\"never quite connects all the dots\\". He was critical of the little attention given to the role of trade and Islamic Law, noting their importance to understand the full picture. Rosen characterized the author's interest in language as being closer to that of a lexicographer rather than a sociolinguist, citing his frequent use of peculiar words compared to the rarity of showing the \\"actual use of Arabic in social and political life\\". Rosen added: The author's analysis of specific moments in Arab history may exercise specialists for years to come, but general readers perusing today's news from the region may still resonate to the author's characterization of a distinctively Arab ethos. =Non-English= Mohamed Meziane of Universit√© Ibn-Tofail wrote a 7-page review for Hesp√©ris-Tamuda in which he summarized much of the book. He praised it for avoiding superficiality, generalizations and the \\"arrogant orientalist view\\". Meziane emphasized the importance of reading the book as a whole to understand its thesis, and praised Mackintosh-Smith's knowledge of Arab thought, soul and land, citing his use of Arab historical, literary and poetic sources such as Ibn Khaldun, Al-Jahiz, Taha Hussein and Nizar Qabbani. He noted the differentiation made by the author between Arabs and Muslims, adding that the word \\"Arab\\" is vague and denotes a heterogeneous race. Meziane was particularly fascinated by the links the author makes between past and present in order to explain recent affairs such as the Arab Spring. Writing for Al Jazeera, Omran Abdulla praised the book's \\"enrichment of the picture with fascinating details\\", noting the author's intimate knowledge and deep passion for Sanaa, the capital city of Yemen where he had lived for over three decades. Abdulla added that the author viewed Arab expansion during the early era of Islam as part of a historical trend of raiding and looting that continues to present day in the form of dictators such as Bashar al-Assad who loot their own people. He thought the author ignored the substantial differences between bandits and \\"Islamic civilizational expansion\\" that carried knowledge and principles of administration to conquered areas, without engaging in pillaging of local inhabitants. Philip Parker reviewed the book favorably for Le Point. Referrering to the task of writing the history of such a vast area over 3,000 years as Herculean, Parker nevertheless said the author was successful because his anaylsis focused on the factors of geography, culture and above all language. In Al Araby television network, Aref Hijjawi favorably reviewed the book. He was fascinated by the \\"breathtaking\\" style of the author, agreeing with The New York Times description of it: \\"Tim Mackintosh-Smith seems incapable of writing a dull sentence\\". He noted the book's insights on the origins of Arab disunity, citing Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement and the inability of Arabs to (re)unite following independence because of their inherent disunity that traces all the way back to Basus War in 5th-6th century. The translated poems earned a special mention by Hijjawi, who found them very pleasant to read with their orderly qaafiyaa, and he praised their complete faithfullness to original meaning, citing the author's use of the 40-volume Arabic dictionary Taj al-Arus. The humorous style, love for Arabic language and heartfelt criticisms were hailed as distinct features, putting the author above any accusation of arrogant orientalism as characterized by Edward Said. Finally, he pleaded for the book to be translated to Arabic. In a review for Asharq Al-Awsat, Maher Farid expressed his delight that a western researcher would have such deep knowledge of Arabic literature, citing some poems for Imru' al-Qais, Abu Tammam and Al-Ma'arri. While he praised the author for his abundant knowledge, penetrating insight and tireless research, he warned against taking his conclusions uncritically. Farid added: Ultimately [Arabs] remains the product of a Western perspective that is foreign to Arab culture, no matter how much effort is made to understand it, approach it and sympathize with it. That is why‚Äìwhile we must benefit from what he says‚Äìwe should take what he says on some issues [...] with a pinch of salt, always remembering what Edward Said wrote in Orientalism on the impossibility of complete objectivity in the writings of Westerners on Arabs, and the mixing of pure scientific research with other considerations, no matter how much the Western researcher seeks to remain neutral, observe fairness, and put pre-existing biases aside. In another review for Arabs in Asharq Al-Awsat, Samir Attallah described it as a fascinating book that manages to surpass those of Philip Hitti and Albert Hourani in some aspects. He cited two insights putting Mackintosh-Smith ahead of the aforementioned authors: his remark that Arabic was only made the official language during the reign of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan and his explanation for the relative decline of Arab science due to a combination of Ottoman ban on printing press and difficulties in printing Arabic letters as they take different forms depending on their location. He noted the author's extensive use of both Arabic and English sources, and his contrarian views on the Shia‚ÄìSunni dispute, which he sees not as a religious conflict as much as a family dispute that developed following the death of Muhammad, and therefore a continuation of ancient tribalism and disunity. Recognition Arabs was longlisted for the 2020 Ondaatje Prize presented by the Royal Society of Literature.

The building was erected in the years 1843‚Äì1846 on the site of an older Uniate temple probably built in the first half of In the 18th century, in the year of completion of construction works, the building was consecrated by the Vilnius and Lithuanian metropolitan J√≥zef. It was the largest of the Orthodox temples of Bialystok. In the interwar period one of two active churches in the city. From 1951, it was the cathedral of the Bia≈Çystok-Gda≈Ñsk diocese.

The building represents the classical style, typical of the church architecture of the Russian Empire in the second half. 18th century and the first decades of the 19th century The cathedral is located in the center of Bia≈Çystok at Lipowa Street 5. It entered in the register of monuments on January 24, 1957 under the number A-200. HistoryThe first church of St. Nicholas= The first church of St. Nicholas in Bialystok, located near today's cathedral was a branch of the temple in Dojlidy. According to some sources, it already existed in the 16th century.[Sob√≥r ≈õw. Miko≈Çaja, Bia≈Çystok (pol.). orthodox.bialystok.pl] According to others, the marriage of Jan Klemens and Katarzyna Barbara Branicki founded the Uniate church of St. Nicholas before 1727 - this year comes a document in which Branicki offered 25 zlotys for her pastor for the deceased from his family.Danieluk E. i A.: Prawos≈Çawne cerkwie Bia≈Çegostoku i okolic. Bia≈Çystok: Stowarzyszenie Bractwo Prawos≈Çawne ≈õw. ≈õw. Cyryla i Metodego, s. 36‚Äì37. . This is the oldest mention of the functioning of the temple of this rite. Probably, however, the foundation of the Uniate church took place at the end of the 17th century, in the years 1694‚Äì1696, during the dynamic development of the city. Funding it, Stefan Miko≈Çaj Branicki built a church for new residents arriving in the city. Such a hypothesis, presented by Przemys≈Çaw Czy≈ºewski, is evidenced by the inscription on the church antimine, which was signed by bishop Leon Za≈Çƒôski in 1708.Koty≈Ñska-Stetkiewicz. Sob√≥r katedralny pw. ≈õw. Miko≈Çaja Cudotw√≥rcy. ‚ÄûBiuletyn Konserwatorski Wojew√≥dztwa Podlaskiego‚Äù. 8‚Äì9, s. 45‚Äì47, 2003. Bia≈Çystok: Wojew√≥dzki UrzƒÖd Ochrony Zabytk√≥w. The building was located at Choroska Street, at the Choroska Gate [4], was wooden, painted yellow and gray, with red domes. From 1748 comes the first information about the vicar parish in Dojlidy, whose duty was to service the church of St. Nicholas. In 1773 the building was described as follows: wooden, plastered with lime, roofed tiles, with three domes, with iron crosses, gold-plated knobs.Mironowicz A.: Sob√≥r ≈õwiƒôtego Miko≈Çaja w Bia≈Çymstoku. Bia≈Çystok: Orthdruk, p. 6 In the same description, which is part of the inspection protocol of the Dojlidy parish, it was written that the temple had three altars: the main one with the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary with two silver crowns and two side ones, dedicated respectively to Christ the Savior (\\"Spasytel\\") and Saint. Nicholas. Architecturally, the church was very similar to the Roman Catholic churches emerging at the same time: it had a square vestibule on the west side, a rectangular nave and a narrower presbytery. It was 14.2 meters long and 6.2 meters wide. =Under the Russian partition= The construction of the new temple was associated with the increase in the number of inhabitants of Bia≈Çystok as a result of the development of local industry and with the increase in the number of Orthodox Christians, resulting from the liquidation of the Uniate Church in the Russian Empire (outside the Diocese of Che≈Çm) and the influx of Russian officials. In October 1838, the design of the church was entrusted to the architect, Mikhailov, but there is no clear evidence that he is the author of the building plan [4]. In 1840, a new temple design was approved. On March 21, 1843, the superior of the new church was dedicated by the superior of the monastery in Supra≈õl, Archimandrite Nikodem. In the years 1843‚Äì1846 a new one was erected next to the wooden church, and after the works were completed, the older building was demolished. The cemetery, which originally surrounded the church of St. Nicholas, and the preserved tombstones were moved to the hill with the chapel of St. Mary Magdalene. The total cost of construction was over 36 thousand. silver rubles, of which less than 3 thousand transferred the state treasury.S. Borowik. Jak w Bia≈Çymstoku budowano sob√≥r ≈õw. Miko≈Çaja. ‚ÄûPrzeglƒÖd Prawos≈Çawny‚Äù. 4 (286), kwiecie≈Ñ 2009. Bia≈Çystok The new temple from the beginning of its existence was the seat of the Orthodox parish, taking over the functions of the chapel of St. Alexander Nevsky in the Branicki Palace. The new temple was built in the classical style, with elements referring to the architecture of antique, as well as to Byzantine cross-dome temples. Dawid Zab≈Çudowski managed the construction works. In 1846, the temple was commissioned and blessed by the Vilnius and Lithuanian metropolitan J√≥zef, who had previously particularly supported efforts to build it. She became the second cathedral of the Vilnius and Lithuanian eparchy, in the rank of council. By 1850, she obtained a set of necessary equipment. According to the equipment list from 1859, five bells were located on its belfry, while the Bialystok Icon of the Mother of God was the object of worship of both the Orthodox and Catholic people. The first renovation of the facility took place in the years 1868‚Äì1872. Twelve years later, the faithful funded the insertion of the icon of St. Alexander Nevsky, which was to commemorate the coronation of the emperor Alexander III and his wife Maria Feodororny. On August 25, 1897, the church was visited by Emperor Nicholas II and his wife Alexander Fyodorovna. In remembrance of their visit, the Council received gifts from private donors for the purchase of a silver Gospel. From the beginning of its operation, the interior of the cathedral was decorated with frescoes, but the first composition, made during the years of construction, was destroyed before 1910. In the aforementioned year, a group of Russian painters under the leadership of Mikhail Avivov made a new decoration, modeled in their work on the frescoes of Viktor Vasnetsov from the Cathedral of St. W≈Çodzimierz in Kiev. In 1910, the church roof was renovated. In 1900, due to the change of administrative borders of the eparchy, the church in Bialystok was included in the Grodno eparchy. Again, it became the second cathedral of the eparchy . On October 24, 1910, after renovation, the building was consecrated again by Bishop of Grodno and Brest Micha≈Ç. =In independent Poland= After Poland regained its independence, most of the Orthodox religious buildings in Bialystok were recognized as symbols of Russification policy and revised for the Catholic Church. On July 11, 1936, the Pochaiv Icon of the Mother of God was brought to Bialystok; in a service held before her in the church of St. Miko≈Çaj was attended by one and a half thousand people. Two years later, the building celebrated the 950th anniversary of the baptism of Rus. Until 1951 the church of St. Nicholas in Bialystok was an ordinary parish temple. On September 7, 1951, when the Council of Bishops of the Polish Autocephalous Orthodox Church founded the diocese of Bia≈Çystok-Gda≈Ñsk, it received the status of cathedral cathedral. In the years 1955‚Äì1958 the building was renovated and modernized. At that time, the outer walls and the presbytery were renovated, and the church of St. Serafina from Sar√≥w. In the first years after World War II, the Ministry of Public Security conducted surveillance of the clergy serving in the Council as part of the object case codenamed Miko≈Çaj. From 1975 to 1976, the inner walls of the church were renovated. It turned out then that renewal and preservation of Avivov's frescoes was not possible, so it was decided to remove them and make a completely new painting decoration. Only in the presbytery a fresco of Avivov with the figure of the Risen Christ was preserved. The author of the paintings, which replaced the work of Russian painters, is J√≥zef Latviaowski. In 1987, the council was visited by Constantinople Patriarch Dmitri, and a year later the millennium of the baptism of Rus was celebrated under the leadership of the metropolitan of Warsaw and all of Poland Basil. In June 1991, the visit to the church was part of the program of the visit of Pope John Paul II to Poland. In the years 1988‚Äì1990 the cathedral was renovated again. During this renovation, the exterior plasters of the building were replaced, the kiots and the iconostasis were renovated and gilded, the roof and domes were covered with copper sheet. From 1991 to 1995, work was carried out on developing the immediate surroundings of the cathedral. On September 21‚Äì22, 1992, the Council took place the ceremony of transferring the relics of St. Gabriela Zab≈Çudowski, until then kept in Grodno and handed over to the Polish Autocephalous Orthodox Church by Bishop Grodno and Wo≈Çkowyski Walenty. In the procession from the city limits to the cathedral over 70 thousand. faithful and nine Orthodox bishops, from the Polish Autocephalous Orthodox Church and the Belarusian Exarchate, as well as the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Bialystok Edward Kisiel and the Bialystok Voivode. In June 2010, the Council was visited by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Theophilos III, August 18, 2012 - head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia, Cyril I, August 21, 2016 - Patriarch of Antioch, Jan X, in August 2018 - the metropolitan of America and Canada, Tikhon Mollard, head of the Orthodox Church of America , and September 21-22 of the same year, Alexandrian Patriarch Theodor II.

However, children are susceptible to multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a rare but life-threatening systemic illness involving persistent fever and extreme inflammation following exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As a vulnerable population, children and youth may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in many other domains, including education, mental health, safety, and socioeconomic stability; the infection of the virus may lead to separation or loss of their family. As with many other crises, the COVID-19 pandemic may compound existing vulnerabilities and inequalities experienced by children.  Vaccines  As of September 22, 2020, no vaccine trials were being conducted on children under the age of 18 years.Graphic chart of children and youth out of school due to COVID-19 closures, and young people classified as alt=Two donut pie charts illustrating material presented in the text.  School closures  By the end of March 2020, UNESCO estimated that over 89% of the world's student population was out of school or university due to closures aimed at mitigating the spread of COVID-19. This raised serious concerns regarding the social, economic, and educational impacts of protracted school closures on students. In addition, school closures disproportionately affect children from low-income or minority families, children with disabilities, and young women, due to disparities in access to distance education, unequal distribution of increased child-care and domestic responsibilities, and the fact that school subsidized meal programs and vaccinations are cornerstones of child healthcare for many families. For example, school closures during the 2014‚Äì2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa increased school dropouts, rates of child labor, violence against children, and teen pregnancies.  Impact on most at-risk groups  Child safety is at risk during the pandemic. Children who are living in unsanitary and crowded conditions are particularly at risk. Youth ‚Äì especially young women, indigenous peoples, migrants, and refugees ‚Äì face heightened socioeconomic and health impacts and an increased risk of gender-based violence due to social isolation, discrimination and increased financial stress. They are also more prone to child marriage as families seek ways to alleviate economic burdens. Although reports of child abuse in the US declined by an average of 40.6% from April 2019 to April 2020, child welfare advocates suggest that this drop is an under-reporting artifact secondary to the closure of schools and daycare centers, where most reports of child abuse are made. = Unemployment = Unemployment is a serious concern for young people. Following the 2008 Economic Recession, youth unemployment rates were significantly higher than overall averages, and the recent expansion of the gig economy will likely heighten this disparity. Before the pandemic, there was already an upward trend in the number of young people not in employment, education, or training (NEET). 267 million young people globally are classified as NEET. = Impact on young migrants = This global crisis is exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and inequalities experienced by young people, amplified in humanitarian contexts where fragility, conflict, and emergencies have undermined institutional capacity and where there is limited access to services. Particularly affected are: young migrants; young people who are internally displaced or refugees; young people living in poor, high-density urban areas; young people without a home; young people living with disabilities; and those living with HIV. Young people separated from, unaccompanied, or left behind by migrant working parents face higher risks of exploitation, violence, and mental health issues, as well as poor access to health services and protection.

Born in Biebrich, Schmidt became a gardener, and in 1898 he joined the General German Gardeners' Union. Shortly after, he moved to Mannheim, where he joined the local Verein Edelwei√ü association, which he persuaded to join the union. In 1902, he was elected to the union's national executive, and in 1903, he successfully persuaded the union to affiliate to the General Commission of German Trade Unions. From 1904, Schmidt worked as one of three full-time employees of the union, with responsibility for southern Germany. In 1905, he became managing director of the union's newspaper, the Allgemeine Deutsche G√§rtner-Zeitung. In 1907, Schmidt became the president of the union, and within two years, he had increased its membership to 5,000. This brought him to the attention of Carl Legien, leader of the General of Commission of German Trade Unions. The federation were establishing the Union of Agricultural, Forest and Vineyard Workers of Germany, and Legien persuaded Schmidt to become its full-time president. Under Schmidt's leadership, the union grew rapidly, becoming the German Agricultural Workers' Union, and negotiated pay and conditions with employers. In 1919, the General Commission was replaced by the General German Trade Union Confederation, and Schmidt served on its executive. From 1924, he also served as general secretary of the International Landworkers' Federation. Schmidt was also a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), and he was elected to the Prussian State Assembly in 1919, and then the Reichstag in 1920, representing Pomerania. He also served on the Provisional Reich Economic Council in 1920, and from 1924 until 1933. In both his political and trade union roles, Schmidt argued against tariffs. He tried to persuade the ADGB to support a reduction in pay for civil servants. He also negotiated a major agreement with Polish trade unionists on the role of migrant agricultural workers from Poland. He remained in his trade union posts until the Nazi government banned unions in 1933, and maintained his trade union and social democratic contacts over the following years. At the end of World War II, the SPD was re-established, and Schmidt served on its Berlin agricultural policy committee.

On September 13, 1958, the museum moved to the rebuilt town hall. Due to the expansion of the area, new workshops were established - next to the existing, historical and archeological ones, in 1958 an art workshop was established, in 1962 an ethnographic workshop, and in 1965 an academic and educational workshop. In 1973, the museum developed rapidly, it was handed over to the palace in Choroszcz, where an interior exhibition was created. A Museum Point was also created in the refectory and chapel of the former Abbots' Palace in Supra≈õl. Two years later, the historical workshop moved from the guest palace at 1 Kili≈Ñskiego Street to the historic Cytron Palace at Warszawska 37 Street. A new branch was established in Tykocin, based in the rebuilt synagogue and Talmudic house. In 1982 and in the areas located in Wasilk√≥w on the road to August√≥w, the Bialystok Village Museum was established. In 1984, in the renovated town hall in Bielsk Podlaski a branch was established. The turn of the century brought further name changes to the institutions: on April 27, 1998 at the State Museum in Bialystok, and on April 25, 2000 it was renamed the Podlaskie Museum in Bialystok. From January 1, 2020, the Podlaskie Museum is co-run by the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage and the Podlaskie Voivodeship. A 10-year contract in this matter was signed on December 17, 2019.

Scientific contributions  Mora developed a widely used model of the interaction of laser light with plasmas in connection with energy transport in plasma and plasma hydrodynamics. With his colleague Jean-Francois Luciani, he also developed a nonlinear and non-local theory of heat transport in a plasma via electrons. This has applications in improving numerical simulations in laser- driven inertial fusion. With Tom Antonsen, he developed a model of the propagation of laser pulses in non-dense plasmas that revealed their tendency to self-focus or to display Raman scattering. Mora developed a theory of the expansion of plasmas into vacuum, which explains the flow dynamics and structure of the ion front. His theories are used to explain ion and electron beam acceleration experiments.  Honors and awards  In 1997, he received the from the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Physique.

LifeEarly years= He was born in Milan to Isabella Rangoni (a noblewoman from Modena) and her husband Ermes I Stampa, 2nd marquess of Soncino and younger brother of Massimiliano Stampa, 1st marquess of Soncino and noted castellan of Milan). Via his mother he was descended from a famous family of condottieri and he also boasted links with the Bentivoglio family, lords of Bologna, and with the Malaspina family. His father's family, by contrast, was mainly made up of 'new men' from the duchy of Milan, where his uncle the 1st marquess had made his fortune. He succeeded his father's titles on his premature death in 1557. In Milan he married Marianna de Leyva, whose brother was father to the famous Virginia de Leyva.

In 1596 he arrived back in Soncino, where he decided to become a Capuchin monk at the monastery he had helped found only a few years earlier. He took the name of Fra Ambrogio and handed his title as marquess over to his son Ermes II. He also wrote much prose and poetry during this time as well as publishing poems and other works by his father. He then was then suddenly won over by the orders set up to free Christians enslaved by Ottoman and Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean.

Black Lives Matter DC activists, on the evening of June 6, 2020, removed the three stars from the D.C. flag and added \\"Defund the Police\\" in capital letters to the end of the mural. In the following weeks, dozens of similar street murals were painted across the United States. Naming On June 5, 2020, during the George Floyd protests, the DC Public Works Department painted the words \\"Black Lives Matter\\" in yellow capital letters on 16th Street NW on the north of Lafayette Square, part of President's Park near the White House, with the assistance of the MuralsDC program of the DC Department of Public Works, with the DC flag accompanying the text. On the same date, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, Muriel Bowser announced that part of the street outside of the White House had been officially renamed to Black Lives Matter Plaza posted with a street sign. When announcing the renaming, she said, \\"Breonna Taylor, on your birthday, let us stand with determination.\\" In a press conference, she explained, \\"There are people who are craving to be heard and to be seen and to have their humanity recognized. We had the opportunity to send that message loud and clear on a very important street in our city.\\" The naming of the street has been seen by many as not only a reaction to the protests but part of it. Mayor Bowser's decision to rename the segment of 16th Street NW as a public gathering place, or plaza, followed DC precedent for the commemorative renaming of city streets, under the Code of the District of Columbia. Location Black Lives Matter Plaza Street Sign. The signs are black with white lettering. This style of sign is unique in DC to Black Lives Matter Plaza.

The suit contends that Black Lives Matter is a \\"cult for secular humanism\\" and a religious organization, and thus Bowser's action of renaming the plaza an endorsement of a religion violating the separation of church and state.

The image perceived at this angle is viewpoint-specific, meaning it cannot be perceived at any other position, known as generic or non-accidental viewpoints. These view-specific angles are involved in object recognition. In its uses in art and other visual illusions, the accidental viewpoint creates the perception of depth often on a two- dimensional surface with the assistance of monocular cues.  Object recognition  According to the recognition-by-components theory, object recognition is viewpoint-invariant. However, viewpoint specific angles are a necessity in object recognition when identifiable features cannot be viewed from all angles. Object recognition is more accurate when identifying similarities between objects that are moving compared to objects that are static. In this case, viewing an object from an accidental viewpoint can result in altered perception in relation to mental prototypes. When viewing an object from an accidental viewpoint scene consistency is more critical for object recognition than when viewing that object from a non-accidental viewpoint, so in some cases viewing an object from its accidental viewpoint actually makes it harder to recognize the object, but we counteract that difficulty using contextual inference. The Ambassadors, 1533, Hans Holbein the Younger The Ambassador's Skull: detail when viewed from the accidental viewpoint (from The Ambassadors ‚Äì Hans Holbein the Younger) = Controversy = 2D symmetry was once thought to be able to facilitate 3D object recognition under accidental viewpoints. Some psychologists have proposed that the accidental viewpoints of 3D objects often involves the 2D symmetrical images that may not be perceived in the 3D objects. However, researches showed that 2D symmetry will not help object matching in accidental viewpoints, and others have argued that accidental viewpoints with 2D symmetry will even hinder 3D object matching and object recognition. Results from face recognition study also agrees on the negative effect of symmetric face from accidental views.  Art  Accidental viewpoint contributes to the successful perception of anamorphic images, which intentionally appear distorted from non-accidental viewpoints. Other than viewing the image from a specific location, the distortion can be countered by looking at the image when reflected in a mirror (known as catoptric anamorphoses). How our brains interpret images make it so that the geometry of 2D object is related to that of 3D objects, rather than just taking the image for how it is, a drawing made from a single viewpoint. Related to this is the generic viewpoint assumption, which is the tendency to assume that image characteristics are not a result of an accidental viewpoint. The artist and mathematician Niceron developed a method of creating perspective anamorphic images by segmenting an image into a grid then distorting each segment of the grid from a square shape to a trapezoidal shape. The image can then be reconciled by viewing it from a specific point. Two dimensional art objects generally use the assumption of a single viewpoint to give the illusion of depth (monocular depth cues), Hans Holbein's The Ambassadors (1533) is no different in that sense, however, Holbein also includes an anamorphic image of a skull which has a completely different view point in order to accurately view the object. In the 17th century, perspective boxes (peep boxes, raree shows) became popular attractions. These took advantage of the accidental viewpoint by creating a scene that appeared to be three dimensional when viewed through a single hole in the box. A modern representation of anamorphic images that makes use of an accidental viewpoint can be found in illusionistic street art.  Psychological illusion  alt=View of one side of the interior, not through the intended viewpoint Psychologists have exploited the assumption of the generic viewpoint by using an accidental viewpoint to trick the brain into perceiving a scene that is realistically impossible. One famous example of this is the Ames room which uses distortion to create the image of a room that looks regular from an accidental viewpoint. When people interact with the room they appear to be changing size. The accidental viewpoint can also be used to trick Gestalt principles such that a curved line can appear straight when viewed from an accidental viewpoint. The accidental viewpoint it also used when creating possible versions of impossible object illusions.

It was established following an idea by Dr Disney Thorpe, designed by William Billinton, a Wakefield architect, and built by public subscription during the 1830s. The zoo was never particularly successful; only part of the envisioned landscape plan was built and it remained in debt for the whole of its existence. The Gardens closed for the first time in December 1848 but were auctioned and then operated for a further ten years before final closure. The site was redeveloped for the construction of Cardigan Road and large villas. There are very few traces of the zoo and gardens now, but remaining artefacts include the Bear Pit, much of the original stone perimeter wall along Chapel Lane, which are both Grade II listed, and many mature trees in what are now private gardens. HistoryFounding= Following the industrialisation of England, the newly-dense cities and towns such as Leeds began to find problems with a lack of green spaces for their expanding populations to recreate in. The learned and political classes feared this would lead to increased pursuits like alcohol and gambling, and began to see a risk to public order. It was in these circumstances that the 1833 Select Committee on Public Walks was convened by Parliament to look into the availability of public parks and gardens. One of the people who gave evidence to the committee was the industrialist and Headingley resident John Marshall, who stated that in Leeds, a town which now had a population of 72,000, Woodhouse Moor, Holbeck Moor and Hunslet Moor were the only public open spaces. The recommendation of the select committee was that all towns should build walks at their fringes, funded either by rates or, like many projects of the time, by voluntary subscription. This recommendation was not adopted by Leeds Corporation, but with inter-city rivalries of such concern in the era - botanical gardens were being opened in Sheffield, Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham - individuals within the elite saw the opportunity for a private venture in Leeds. The idea to establish a pleasure park was proposed in 1836 by Dr Disney Thorpe, a physician at Leeds General Infirmary, who held the vision of inspiring people to spend their leisure time in the fresh country air. In a letter to the Leeds Mercury on 24 December 1836, he wrote: > No one can have failed to have observed that whilst the wealth, importance > and population of this town have gradually increased, the opportunities for > public recreation have in ratio diminished ... [Enclosures and the spread of > buildings] render it everyday more difficult for the labourer and artisan to > breath in pure and uncontaminated atmosphere. Thorpe produced a proposal to raise money for the project via ¬£10 shares in a commercial company. A public meeting to discuss the founding of a Leeds Botanical Gardens was held at the Court House, Park Row, on 22 May 1837, convened by the clerk to the corporation, Edwin Eddison. Thorpe's scheme was agreed at the meeting, with a minimum of ¬£10,000 and a maximum of ¬£20,000 to be raised through shares, and that work would begin once ¬£7,500 () had been raised. During the following week, share sales reached ¬£8,000, more than enough to commence planning for the gardens. The subscription list of 1,100 shows many wealthy Leeds families purchased shares, including two hundred by John Marshall and his son, but also that the majority were ordinary citizens who owned only a small number of shares each. The shareholders elected a committee of 21 to run the scheme day-to-day but had formal authority over the company at its annual general meeting. Though share purchases soon slowed, the project was set in motion as four fields were purchased for ¬£5,000 (). Open fields were all that covered the southern slopes of Headingley Hill in the early 19th century, Headingley still at that point being a village separate to the town of Leeds. The four which were chosen for the gardens were formerly part of the Bainbrigge estate, although two were owned by Thorpe himself. The design featured formal gardens and botanical conservatories like these at Birmingham Botanical Gardens The competition for designs and cost estimates was launched in September 1837, which was marked by the committee and received seventeen designs. The winner was chosen at the end of that year to be William Billinton, a civil engineer and architect from Wakefield, who worked with Edward Davies, a botanist and landscape gardener. Their elaborate plan for the site took substantial inspiration from the leading garden planner John Claudius Loudon, who had designed the Birmingham Botanical Gardens less than a decade earlier, by using a combination of formal elements - such as Classical entrance lodges and glass conservatories - and relaxed scenic elements like a lake, paths, bridges and fountains. Fenced areas for zoological specimens were also included in the plan. There were already many mature trees in the area, and the land also had several natural watercourses that would help fill up the proposed lakes. A new access road was to be built to the park - Spring Road would be named after these natural springs. If these plans could be realised, then Leeds would have had one of the finest public gardens. However, only around ¬£11,000 was ever raised in shares, forcing much of the design to remain unbuilt. This was compounded by the cost of laying the garden out being four times the estimate, costing ¬£2,000, as the whole site required draining and planting. Other early difficulties included a fire in June 1838 which caused the destruction of one of the buildings and the workshop. As expenses mounted, in February 1840 the committee considered selling or letting the site as a graveyard, for which there was local need, but decided against this, choosing instead to open to the public as soon as possible and hope to recoup funds through general admission. The formal opening of the gardens took place on 8 July 1840, and featured a crowded ceremony attended by 2,000 people, with flags, bands, and a live demonstration of birds of prey. Reports from contemporaneous local newspapers took different angles on the new gardens; the Leeds Intelligencer disparaged the fountain which had no water and the display with the hawks, which involved the shredding of live birds to show the hawks' natural behaviour. On the other hand, the Leeds Mercurys adulatory report made no mention of those, saying: > Surrounded by a high wall within which on the west, south and east, is a > plantation of trees in proper botanical arrangement, and on the north are > fruit trees trained against a wall. Beautiful slopes of grass, tasteful > parterres and shrubberies, with winding walks, two very handsome ponds with > islands and a beautiful fountain. Near the entrance to the grounds from > Headingley is a conservatory containing a beautiful collection of geraniums > and a variety of exotic plants and flowers. The general appearance of the > gardens is exceedingly beautiful, interesting, and lively, and though we > hope to see their attractions heightened by the addition of the aviary, > conservatories, &c; originally intended, yet even at present they form a > most attractive place of resort. Great credit is due to the Council, but > especially to Mr. Eddison, the Secretaries, and the Curators, who have had > nearly all the arrangements on their own shoulders. An inaugural attraction featuring fireworks and a hot air balloon flight, a popular display of the time, was scheduled to occur on 7 October, but was cancelled due to it taking too long to fill the balloon from the nearest gas supply in Kirkstall. =Operation= The Gardens charged non-subscribers entry at 6d for adults and 3d for children and servants. This was inexpensive for middle-class visitors, but was a considerable expenditure for workers on an average weekly wage of less than a pound. A number of other factors conspired to keep visitor numbers low; firstly the distance between Leeds and Headingley (with the price of an omnibus augmenting the cost), but mainly the fact it initially did not open on Sundays, which was the only day off for the working classes. Observance of the Sabbath - a day reserved for church, not leisure - was important to the religious moral reformers behind the project's founding and the decision to close on Sundays had been taken in February 1838 at the society general meeting, passing 369 to 202. Some vocal opposition to the move was expressed at the meeting, with a Dr Williamson saying \\"evils to be apprehended far exceeded any amount of good that could arise from keeping the gardens open\\". As the matter went on to affect attendance at the gardens ‚Äì low visitor numbers made the park suffer heavy losses and ensured no dividends were ever paid ‚Äì a debate grew in the local newspapers, finally leading to a special general meeting of shareholders in August 1841 at the Philosophical Hall, Bond Street, to consider allowing Sunday opening. A thorough report of the meeting by the Leeds Mercury described the motion discussed, which came with the caveats of only opening after 4 o'clock, and that Sunday tickets should only be available to buy on weekdays. One committee member claimed that not having Sunday opening was the reason for the failure of a recent drive to attract more shareholders, and argued that the choice now lay between allowing Sunday opening or closing the Gardens. However, people who were against it raised issues of the effects on peace, and that it might force servants and cab drivers to work on Sundays. The motion was passed 388 to 34 at the meeting and the Gardens opened on Sundays thereafter. Advertisement from the Thomas Clapham era highlighting the recently improved ease of access The Gardens relied for the majority of their income on shows, festivals and galas, such as the annual shows of the Leeds Horticultural and Floral Society, and the Grand County Archery Fete, which was held for two years in the late 1840s. A June 1843 diary entry by Reuben Gaunt, a worsted spinner from Pudsey, reads \\"Went to the Zoological Gardens, Leeds, to a temperance festival, partook a good tea and after hearing the Trial of John Barleycorn, played various rural sports.\\" =Animals and attractions= Although the Gardens were landscaped and filled with lawns, parterres and shrubberies, the zoological features never reached the size, range, or exoticism of rival zoos of the period. On the day of opening in 1840, the Leeds Mercury reported \\"The Zoological department as yet is confined to a fine pair of swans and some other fowl, monkeys and tortoises.\\" When setting up the park in 1838, the committee had explored options for purchasing large animal exhibits, with a budget of ¬£1,000 (). One of the people they consulted was George Wombwell, a famous menagerie exhibitor, who was able to advise that for this price, any elephants would be impossible, though it would be viable to buy a pair of lions. He also stressed for the committee that feeding them and employing keepers would mean costs continuing to escalate. Lions were never subsequently purchased. It took until 1843, three years after opening and with disappointing visitor numbers, for the Gardens to obtain their first and only large animal exhibit, a brown bear, which resided in a turretted pit in the middle of the park. It was described as \\"a very well-bred, decently behaved brown bear\\"; the eventual collection of animals amounted, in addition to those above, to a raccoon, alligator, guinea pigs, an owl, a peacock, and two parrots. =Demise= Advertisement for the auction of some equipment, a boat and the brown bear, July 1857 Being consistently under-funded and dogged by problems, the Gardens were closed for the first time in December 1848, only eight years after inauguration. A Leeds banker named James Smith bought the site at auction that month for ¬£6,010, with an intention to develop housing, but he sold it again to Henry Cowper Marshall, who had been Mayor of Leeds 1842‚Äì43, and the fourth son of the industrialist John Marshall who had given evidence at the original Select Committee and subscribed to the setting up of the gardens. Another of the original investors, Thomas Clapham, offered to take over running the Zoological and Botanical Gardens and leased them from Marshall. Clapham, originally of Keighley, was 30 years old with fresh ideas for making the park a success. The basis of Clapham's strategy was to change the emphasis of the site from education to entertainment and show, and to take advantage of the new Leeds & Thirsk Railway, which opened in 1849 and brought passengers from Harrogate and Ripon to Leeds, passing right by the Gardens. He renamed the park Royal Gardens and persuaded the railway company to open a station of this name at the southern entrance of the park in Burley. Additionally, Clapham took measures including reducing admission prices to 2d, allowing people to hire it for private occasions, and moving back Sunday opening to 1 o'clock. Despite Clapham's efforts, the reopened park still refused to become profitable and was forced to close for good in 1858. Everything including the land, equipment and even the elderly bear were auctioned off, and the railway station closed, although a new station called was built on the same site in 1988 by British Rail. Clapham went on to run another similar attraction next to Woodhouse Moor he named the Royal Park, which also closed due to debts in 1871. The landowner, Henry Cowper Marshall, returned to the previous plan of developing houses across the site. It was divided into building plots and sold off, with Cardigan Road, which runs from Burley Road to Kirkstall Lane, being driven through the centre of the former zoo in 1868; it was wider and faster than the old Chapel Lane. Villas with large gardens were erected in what was known as the \\"Old Gardens Estate\\", resisting the dense back-to-back type of development further down in Hyde Park during this era, with high quality mansions covering the ground by 1893. Present day This listed wall on Spring Road was one of the park entrances. The house is a later build from after the park was sold off. Though the substantial structures of the park such as the botanical conservatories were demolished, the lakes infilled, and more roads and buildings built across the site, large areas of the land once owned by the Zoological and Botanical Gardens remains undeveloped in comparison to the surrounding areas, with a more leafy and affluent character compared to Burley and Hyde Park which directly abut the site. The old gardens continue to have an effect on the character, through the tall boundary walls to Chapel Lane, and the retention of deep front garden of the Victorian villas of Cardigan Road. The villa properties are of considerable stature in both height and width, but there are several examples of contemporary infill developments, extensions, conversions and new-build developments in the area. A number of artefacts remain which can be linked to this relatively brief period in the site's life: * Parts of the retaining wall by the northern entrance are visible in two places on Spring Road, with one part having been built into the side of a house and the other listed at Grade II and now forming part of a garden wall. Its style of stonework with recessed panels and shallow pilasters can be seen as the \\"Principal entrance from Leeds\\" on the illustrated plan (main image). * Most of the stone boundary wall survives, although cut down considerably in places, and is most intact along Chapel Lane and the length of Back Norwood Terrace * The base of a fountain remains in the garden of Cardigan House * One of the former lakes leaves a depression within the grounds of Valley Court (flats) * A small triangle of land bounded by Chapel Lane, Cardigan Road and Spring Road has remained neglected and overgrown due to its unknown ownership. It is now known as Sparrow Park, and was compulsorily purchased by Leeds City Council in 2013, and now has a community group dedicated to maintaining it. * Many of the large, mature trees along Cardigan Road date back to the existence of the Gardens =The Bear Pit= The most recognisable remnant of the gardens is the Bear Pit, which fronts Cardigan Road. The Victorian structure, a sham castle facade constructed of rock-faced masonry, consists of two circular castellated turrets with round-arched entrances, linked by a wall with a gateway. On the inside, the circular bear pit is brick-lined and is linked to the facing by two tunnels. The bear was viewed by visitors by climbing spiral steps to the tops of the turrets, Metal railings would have been fixed around the pit, and the bear also had a wooden pole to climb up to be fed sandwiches and buns. It was the only large animal exhibit, although there were also smaller cages which housed birds, tortoises and monkeys. Bear-baiting had recently been outlawed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, so they were kept only for display and scientific study. Purchase and restoration of the Bear Pit was one of the first acts of the Leeds Civic Trust, established in 1965. It was purchased for ¬£128 in 1966 and restored at a cost of ¬£1,000 by 1968. The Bear Pit is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II listed building, having been designated on 5 August 1976. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing, and is applied to \\"buildings that are nationally important and of special interest\\". In 1983, the Civic Trust applied for planning permission to turn the Bear Pit into an open-air theatre, but this proposal was withdrawn.Planning application H26/349/83/ - access via leeds.gov.uk As of September 2016, the Trust had undertaken major rubbish clearance and Japanese knotweed treatment, however the structure remains as a folly, serving no use beyond a casual heritage attraction.

The oldest Latin spellings were Laumensis or Lomensis. It included the city of Namur, and the region where the County of Namur later came to form in the 10th century. In modern terms Lomme stretched from north to south in what is now central Wallonia in French-speaking Belgium. It corresponds roughly with the part of the modern Province of Namur which is west of the Meuse. It also stretched into what is now Walloon Brabant in the north, the Belgian Province of Hainaut in the west, and to the south, into what is now France. Subpagi Early medieval pagi mapped on modern Belgian provinces. Red triangles are places recorded as being in Lommegau. Blue triangles were in Darnau. Orange were in the Sambre gau. These were both also a part of the Lommegau. The pagus Lomacensis had two major subpagi: the pagus Darnuensis, and the pagus Sambriensis. Today, both of these are in the Belgian province of Hainaut. Records show that places within these sub-divisions of Lomme could also described as being in Lomme, and they might not have had exact definitions. *The Sambriensis pagus, named after the Sambre, is mainly known from the records of Lobbes Abbey, and includes places mainly south of the stretch of the Sambre river between modern Lobbes and Charleroi, and west of the Eau d'Heure river. *The Darnau pagus is also mainly known from Lobbes-related records, including a threat in 982 by Bishop Notger of Li√®ge to excommunicate many of them if they did not stop paying their processional fees to Nivelles Abbey or the Collegiate church of Foillan at Fosses-la-Ville instead of Lobbes (Roland p. 52). It is found mainly north of the Sambre, where it bordered upon the pagi of Brabant and Hesbaye (Hasbania). These two subpagi overlapped near what is now Charleroi, which was not an important city in the Middle Ages, and was known as Charnoy. L√©on Vanderkindere proposed that these were older, and that the pagus Lomacensis represents a fusion of several such older pagi. However more recent writers such as Roland and Nonn see no evidence for this. There was also one mention of a pagus of Namur in the Lomme area in 832, but Namur was not mentioned again as an important jurisdiction until the late tenth century when it started to be referred to as a county. Counts and counties Before the counts of Namur, there is very little clear information about early counts with counties in the Lommegau. However, many of the 9th and 10th century documents which mention Lomme simply describe it as the county of Lomme (comitatus Laumensis), often mentioning no other pagus. This implies strongly that Lomme was considered to be one single county. Nonn lists 11 such records between 862 and 979. Some notable examples show the way in which the mentions of the strategic fort at Namur increased: *In 866, Soye, on the north of the Sambre near Namur, is described as being in the pagus of Darnau, in the county of Gilbert (in comitatu Giselberti). *In 907, Fosses is described as being in the pagus of Lomme, in the county of Berengar (in comitatu Perengarii). Count Berengar is known from other documents. He is also mentioned in a charter from Brogne Abbey calling him Count of Namur (\\"Berengarii comitis Namurcensis\\"). A later medieval narrative source concerning Brogne describes him as a count who held the fort of Namur. It is known that he married a daughter of Reginar I but his connection to the following count of Namur is uncertain. *In 946, Count Robert granted Melin to Waulsort Abbey, described as being in his county (in comitatu meo), and in the pagus Lomacinsus. This Robert is the first certain ancestor of the later counts of Namur. *In a royal charter also of 946, Gembloux is described as being in the county known as Lomme and Darnau (in comitatu scilicet Lomacensi atque Darnuensi). The same wording was used again in a royal charter of 979. *In 958 a royal charter mentions Chastre near Gembloux being in the pagus of Darnau and in the county of Count Robert (ac in Rotberti comitis). *In 986, Brogne is described as being in the pagus of Lomme, in the county of Namur, the first appearance of this title. *In 992, a Count of Namur was named for the first time a royal charter, Adalbert, the son of Robert. After the 10th century, the title of Count of Namur was used, making the gau names less useful. History The pagus was already mentioned in Merovingian times. After a possibly falsified document of 660, more surviving records start in the second half of the 8th century, in the time when the Carolingians were taking charge of the Frankish realm. The Lommegau was one of the oldest Frankish geographical sub-divisions in what is now Belgium. Around 800, the Bishop of Li√®ge addressed himself to the Christian community of the time, and named only Condroz, Lomme, Hasbania, and the Ardennes, with no mention of the Maas valley or Texandria further north.Mansi, Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, 13, column 1084 The northern part of the Roman Civitas Tungrorum probably no longer had clear boundaries, and missionary work to extend the Christian diocese was on-going at this time.J. Dhondt (1952) 'Proloog van de Brabantse geschiedenis. Een inleiding tot de politieke geschiedenis van Noord-Brabant in de 9de en 10de eeuw', in Bijdragen tot de studie van het Brabants Heem, III, p.14. In 843, in the Treaty of Verdun, and in 870 in the Treaty of Meerssen, the \\"Lomensum\\" was mentioned, which is interpreted as a single county, for example by Ulrich Nonn. It switched between kingdoms. In 843 it became part of the \\"Middle Kingdom\\" of Lothar I, the future Lotharingia. In 870 it became part of the western kingdom for some time, which would later become France. Together with the rest of Lotharingia, during the 10th century it became a long-run part of the Holy Roman Empire, and by the 11th century new counties such as the County of Namur stabilized into the forms known throughout the rest of the Middle Ages. Namur was a frontier province confronting France and heavily influenced by it, and sometimes considered to be a March. Territory The natural regions of Belgium Late medieval catholic jurisdictions of Condroz and Famenne, within the archbishopric of Li√®ge. A major part of the pagus was enclosed by the Sambre and Meuse rivers, a region sometimes referred to in French as the Entre- Sambre-et-Maas (fr) region. The Sambre joins the Maas at the city of Namur, in the northeast corner of the pagus. South of the Sambre, near Namur, are rolling hills, and in modern times it is considered to be part of the geographical Condroz, though it was not part of the medieval pagus of Condroz, which was originally only east of the Meuse. The southern part of the Lommegau is today referred to as the Fagne region. It approaches the Ardennes and is more heavily hilly and forested, and is similarly often grouped with the lands over the Meuse to the east, in the geographically similar Famenne region, which was originally a subpagus of the Condroz. Also the church jurisdictions of the Fammene and Fagnes were joined under a single archdeanery. In the west and south of these two parts of the Lommegau, were forested and hilly areas which help define a natural boundary between France and Belgium. In the late Roman times these forests also helped define the boundary between the Roman provinces of Belgica secunda and Germania secunda, and therefore they later helped define the medieval church archdioceses of Reims and Cologne, which were partly based upon Roman provinces. During the evolutions of the Frankish kingdoms, the southern frontier also remained an important one, defining the boundary between Neustria and Austrasia in Merovingian times. In Carolingian times it continued to form the boundary of Western Francia which evolved into France.

He is known for his mural commissions throughout the United States and a number of his pieces are in the permanent collections of major museums.  Biography  Early life and education = Woodward is a third-generation native of Washington, D.C. Woodward‚Äôs father and grandfather were both artists. His father, Thomas Edwin Woodward, was a commercial artist. His paternal grandfather, Edwin Ashley Woodward, was a sign painter of large billboards, restaurant murals, and circus posters and signage. Edwin Woodward also created the first iconic Coca-Cola logo. In 1952, Woodward was admitted to American University on the Mary Graydon academic scholarship. He earned his BA and MA degrees from American University, where he studied with Sarah Baker, Ben Summerford, and Robert Gates. He also studied at The Catholic University of America with the art historian John Shapley. He was subsequently awarded a two-year fellowship from The Leopold Schepp Foundation (1957-59) for independent study abroad. He used this fellowship to study in Florence, Italy, at the Accademia di Belli Arti. While studying in Florence, he became a frequent guest of the art historian and art connoisseur Bernard Berenson, at Villa I Tatti. = Teaching = In Washington DC, Woodward taught drawing at the Sheridan School, American University, Madeira School, Saint Albans School, and the Corcoran School of Art. At present, he is Professor Emeritus of Fine Art at George Washington University, where he was program director for the Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree for 37 years (1969-2006). During his tenure at GWU he directed the overseas summer study program in Brittany, France for many years. He mentored several generations of artists in the materials and techniques of the Old Masters. Many of his former students became noted contemporary artists.  Style and technique  Woodward‚Äôs work synthesizes the techniques of the Old Masters with contemporary subject matter. He works primarily in oils, in alla prima painting, on hand stretched canvas. In his work, he often employs the multiple glaze technique favored by the Old Masters. He has presented lectures and demonstrations as a guest expert at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, re-creating the painting techniques of Old Masters, such as Titian and Peter Paul Rubens. In an article by Rafael Squirru in Americas Magazine, Woodward explained: ‚ÄúWithout commitment to any dogma, I explore the familiar, seeking to uncover a significant surprise that it still contains ‚Äì a poignance of mood, an unexpected aspect of color, a novel juxtaposition of shapes. I strive to record the fleeting circumstances or context which engages me.‚Äù  Critical reaction  In Americas Magazine, Rafael Squirru, former Cultural Director of the Organization of American States, called Woodward a ‚Äúvirtuoso... a painter‚Äôs painter‚Äù. Benjamin Forgey, art and architectural critic of The Washington Post, observed, ‚Äú[Woodward‚Äôs] paintings are alive with knowledge, translated from eye to hand‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs really wonderful what he can do. His ability to draw, his feeling for the figure in space, his understanding of dramatic situations ‚Äì his skills have kept developing in the 25 years that I‚Äôve observed him.‚Äù In a Washington Post review of his solo exhibition, Back to Brittany at the Fendrick Gallery in Washington, DC, Mary McCoy praised Woodward as ‚Äú...one of Washington‚Äôs most fluent realist painters.‚Äù Mark Jenkins for The Washington Post recently noted, ‚ÄúWilliam Woodward is not literally an Old Master... But the local painter has the range and technique of one.‚Äù Jill Wechsler for American Artist wrote, ‚ÄúWoodward has contributed to restoring faith in the continued vitality of traditional painting, helping to secure its niche in the modern art world.‚Äù  Select works  Murals and paintings in public places = Many of his major commissions are murals and paintings in public spaces, including: * 2009: Jefferson at Monticello, Thomas Jefferson Visitors Center, Monticello, Charlottesville, VA * 2008: Dolley Madison Rescuing the Portrait of George Washington, Montpelier Visitors Center, Madison, VA * 2007: A View of the Soldiers Home in Lincoln‚Äôs Time, Lincoln Cottage Visitor Center, Washington, DC * 2002: A Loudoun County Story, Thomas Balch Library, Leesburg, VA * 1996: The Great Odyssey of Medicine, Cyrus Vesuna Conference Center, Inova Fairfax Hospital, Fairfax, VA * 1985: Today‚Äôs Army Proud and Ready/Leadership, Department of Defense, Washington, DC * 1983: Space Shuttle Launch, Orbital Flight STS-7, NASA, Washington, DC * 1982: The Memorial Day Parade, City Hall, Rockville, MD * 1976: Portrait of John Paul Jones, National Park Service, Harpers Ferry, WV = Permanent collections = Woodward's works are also part of the permanent collections of the Speed Art Museum, Lexington, Kentucky; Washington County Museum of Fine Arts, Hagerstown, Maryland; Ogunquit Museum of Fine Arts, Ogunquit, Maine; National Air and Space Museum, Washington, DC; American University Museum at the Katzen Arts Center, Washington, D; Huntington Museum of Art, Pasadena, California; Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota, Florida; and Corcoran Museum of Art, Washington, DC. = Other works = One of Woodward‚Äôs most notable series is his depiction of The Seven Deadly Sins: A Comedy. In 2017, the series was exhibited at the American University Museum at the Katzen Arts Center in Washington, DC, and attracted record breaking crowds. It has been lauded as the most attended solo show ever held at the museum. 1989 Congress Bicentennial Silver Dollar designed by William Woodward. Woodward is the only artist ever to design both the obverse and reverse of a United States coin as a winner of the invitational design competition. The silver dollar minted in 1989 by the U.S Treasury commemorates the 200th anniversary of the U.S. Congress. The obverse features a depiction of the Statue of Freedom, which crowns the Capitol dome. The reverse of the coin is an illustration of the mace of the United States House of Representatives.

Early life  Yeung studied at Wong Shiu Chi Secondary School in his early years. He graduated from the Department of Politics and Administration at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 2014. Subsequently, he obtained a Master of Laws from the University of Hong Kong in 2016. He served as the president of the CUHK Student Union and the Deputy Secretary-General at the Hong Kong Federation of Students.  Activism  Civil Human Rights Front = Yeung was the former convener of the Civil Human Rights Front between 2013 and 2014. In his role, he helped to organise rallies advocating for Hong Kong's democracy. On 1 July 2014, he organised a large-scale pro-democracy march that drew over 510,000 protesters according to organisers, while the police gave an estimate of 98,600 in attendance. Yeung delivered a speech at the march and stated, \\"Hong Kong has had enough. We're done just fighting individual issues ‚Äì we're fighting the government now, to build a society and a government that belongs to us.\\" On 4 July, Yeung and four other members of the Civil Human Rights Front were arrested for \\"obstruction\\" at the rally from three days ago. Yeung believed the government, led by Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, took this action to suppress the organisers of the rallies. Later that year, Yeung joined the 2014 Hong Kong protests, participating in a series of demonstrations dubbed the Occupy Movement and the Umbrella Movement. In 2015, the police informed him there was insufficient evidence to prosecute from his earlier arrest. Yeung believed the arrest was intended as a method of intimidation. = Anti-extradition protests = Yeung joined the anti- extradition protests that occurred throughout 2019, and had spoken to the media in support of the protesters. On 28 July 2019, Yeung was among those arrested outside the IFC Mall in Central for \\"obstruction of police\\". After 48 hours of detainment, he was released on bail pending further investigation. Upon his release, Yeung delivered a speech to the media and described his experience. He recalled sitting in a parking lot, along with dozens of detainees, under the scorching summer temperature for an entire day. The protesters, many of whom had been charged with rioting and faced up to 10 years of imprisonment, were mostly under the age of 25 according to Yeung. He believed the escalating police and prosecution tactics would only lead to more protests. In June 2020, Yeung was scheduled to speak at an event hosted by activist group Sunrise Movement. The event was intended to exchange comparative strategies between the Hong Kong protests and the Black Lives Matter movement. On 17 June, Sunrise Movement cancelled the event with Yeung, citing internal concerns and external criticisms. Sunrise Movement's decision was met with discontent, with critics highlighting the prevalence of \\"disinformation and smearing campaigns\\" against Hong Kong's activists. Lausan, a publication focused on Hong Kong affairs, stated the pro-democracy movement was being discredited. = Memberships = Over the years, Yeung became involved in numerous human rights organisations. He is a board member at Amnesty International, a member of World Movement for Democracy, and part of the Freedom Fellowship program at Human Rights Foundation. He is also the chairperson of the Hong Kong Civil Hub, an organisation dedicated to promoting the rule of law, democracy, and human rights in Hong Kong.

It was conceived as a funding resource for the Association for the Study of African American Life and History.Goggin, Jacqueline. Carter G. Woodson: A Life in Black History. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1993. It produced more than 200 books, covering wide swaths of African American life and history. Many are of a formal, footnoted nature and were written by recognized authorities in historical scholarship. Some books were collections of short stories, primarily for young readers, with an emphasis on important people and events. Other titles included poetry, drama, and athletic sports. The company published a variety of materials, including monographs, translations of the works of reputable foreign scholars, pictures, and even calendars.Woodson, C. G., Clark, J.

The Grafton Way side of the building, with the blue plaque to Roger Fry. 33 Fitzroy Square is a Grade I-listed townhouse and former hospital on Fitzroy Square in the Fitzrovia district of London, England. It is most famous for having been the location of Omega Workshops, but it also housed the London Foot Hospital and School of Podiatric Medicine from 1929 to 2003, before being converted back into a single house. It is now used primarily as an events venue. The house sits at the southern apex of Fitzroy Square, at the junction between Conway Street and Grafton Way. The house was built in 1794, designed by Robert Adam (as was the rest of the eastern and southern sides of the square). It was used as a townhouse for the first century of its existence. The upper floors of the house were home to Eva Gore-Booth and Esther Roper from 1913. At the same time as Gore-Booth and Roper lived upstairs, Roger Fry downstairs founded and hosted the Bloomsbury Group's Omega Workshops from 1913 to 1919. For this, it has an English Heritage blue plaque to Fry installed on the Grafton Way side of the building. Famous artists based there in that period included Vanessa Bell, Duncan Grant, Dora Carrington, and Wyndham Lewis. The premises hosted a regular Thursday night club, whose members included W. B. Yeats and George Bernard Shaw. After the Omega Workshops went into liquidation, with the financial support of the British Chiropodical Society, the site became the London Foot Hospital. It also hosted the School of Podiatric Medicine, which was supported by University College London. It was not able to be renovated to install lifts, and its closure was mooted - including being debated in the House of Lords - in 1994. When UCL finally terminated its arrangement with the School in 2003, it was moved to Stratford to come under the remit of the University of East London, and the hospital closed. The property was sold for ¬£10.75m in 2010. The entire building and its attached railings are Grade I listed, having been listed in 1954.

The revolt started in 21 CE, after it had started, Roman general Acillius Aviola took a Cohort, or six hundred soldiers, to subdue the Gauls. Acillius Aviola was successful in several provinces. Another commander named Visellius Varo quelled an insurrection at Tours. Sacrovir decided to fight against the Gauls. He wanted to feign friendship with the Romans, so he could betray them later. Florus began the war by raising a regiment of Treviri horsemen, which he would use to massacre Roman merchants. Florus' army was met by Varo's forces led by Julius Indus at the Ardennes Forest; during this battle Florus was killed.

The battalion must also ensure the strategic signalling and information technology support for the Defence Forces and realise development projects in the area of defence, information technology and electronic warfare. The battalion is currently based at Tallinn and is commanded by Lieutenant colonel Priit Averkin. History The predecessor of the battalion was established on 21st November 1918 at the beginning of the Estonian War of Independence. Even though the unit changed its name multiple times during the conflict, it still maintained its original mission to ensure communications between headquarters and fronts. After the war in 1924, various radio and telegraph units were merged into a battalion sized unit, the Signal Battalion (). By 1940, the battalion had become a modern signal corps with proper equipment and training. =Battle of Raua Street= When the Soviet Union occupied Estonia in June 1940, the Signal Battalion was ordered to relocate from its garrison to a building of a local Tallinn high school and surrender its weaponry. When the communists also came for the signallers' personal items, they were kicked out of the building. By the time they came back with Red Army soldiers, the signallers had already armed themselves and a shootout broke out between the opposing sides. The building was attacked by 6 armoured cars and heavy machine guns. By the end of the battle, the Estonians had suffered 1 killed and 3 wounded and the Red Army had suffered at least 10 dead. It was the only armed act of resistance from the Estonian Defence Forces against the occupying Soviets. After these events, the Signal Battalion was merged into the Red Army's 22nd Rifle Corps which was destroyed during the Baltic Operation in 1941. =1993-present= On 29th October 1993, the battalion was re-established as the Single Signal Battalion () and the unit returned to its old garrison in √úlemiste, Tallinn which they had to leave from in 1940.

The line ran on Boylston Street and Ipswich Street in the Fenway‚ÄìKenmore neighborhood, and on Brookline Avenue through what is now the Longwood Medical Area to Brookline Village. First proposed in the mid-1890s to aid development of the newly created Fenway‚ÄìKenmore area, the line opened in July 1900. Service initially ran between Park Street station and Cypress Street Carhouse; service was extended west to Chestnut Hill later in 1900. The east end of the route was cut back to Massachusetts station in 1925. The next year, the Ipswich Street line and the Huntington Avenue line swapped western terminals, with Ipswich Street service again running to Cypress Street. The west end of service was cut back to Brookline Village in 1932, and cut further to a short Audubon Road‚ÄìMassachusetts shuttle in mid-1933. The shuttle was abandoned entirely in July 1934. As streetcar service was cut back, it was replaced by bus routes. MBTA bus routes 55 and 60 are direct descendants of the Ipswich Street line, while route 65 (the descendant of a Huntington Avenue branch) also runs along part of the former line. HistoryStreetcar line= An 1899 illustration of the new tracks on Ipswich Street In the 1890s, the West End Street Railway rapidly electrified its existing horsecar system. The speedier electric streetcars also allowed expansion into suburbs like Brookline and Brighton; new lines were built on Beacon Street in 1888‚Äì89 and on Commonwealth Avenue in 1894‚Äì96. The 1890s also saw the filling of the Back Bay Fens north of the Muddy River for new development. In 1895, a group of Brookline businessmen proposed a street car line from Newton Centre to downtown Boston independent of the West End. The line was to run southeast from Newton Centre on Cypress Street and Jackson Street, east to Brookline on Boylston Street (the Worcester Turnpike), and around Brookline Village on Cypress Street, School Street, and Aspinwall Avenue. It was to then run northeast on Brookline Avenue and the new western section of Boylston Street through the newly filled Fens, then use Newbury Street and Arlington Street to reach the Tremont Street subway. This routing was to avoid all West End-owned tracks, allowing the new line to use the city-owned subway even if the West End would not grant trackage rights over its surface lines. The West End's counterproposal called for an extension from Reservoir on Chestnut Hill Avenue and Boylston Street. In 1897, the West End proposed to extend its line on Boylston Street westward from Massachusetts Avenue through the newly developing area. Objections were raised over the portion through the Fens parkland: the tracks would impede public access to the recently landscaped park, and the arch bridge over the Muddy River was in poor condition. A compromise was soon worked out where the line would divert north along Ispwich Street, parallel to the Boston and Albany Railroad mainline, thus avoiding the park entrance and the deficient bridge. The Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) ‚Äì successor to the West End ‚Äì began construction of the line in early 1899. By midyear, it was largely complete except for gaps where the city was laying water mains. alt=see caption Service on the line as far west as Longwood Avenue began on July 23, 1900. The full route opened around the end of the month; streetcars ran from the Cypress Street carhouse on existing tracks on Cypress Street and Boylston Street, on new tracks northeast on Brookline Avenue and east on Boylston Street and Ipswich Street, then east on existing tracks on Boylston Street to the subway. The same week, the BERy also opened a branch of the Huntington Avenue line from Brookline Village to (with through service to Allston); the two routes shared a short section of track in Brookline Village. The line was extended west on Boylston Street from Cypress Street to Chestnut Hill Avenue on September 29, 1900, and to the Newton line at Chestnut Hill on November 19. On May 5, 1903, the Boston and Worcester Street Railway (B&W;) began operations. It initially terminated at Chestnut Hill, but was extended over BERy tracks on Boylston Street and Huntington Avenue to Park Square on July 6. By 1907, regular service on the Ipswich Street line ran between Chestnut Hill and , with short turns running between Longwood Avenue and Park Street. Cypress Street Carhouse‚ÄìPark Street trips were made to move streetcars in and out of the carhouse. In 1912, the BERy opened a transfer station at Brookline Village, simplifying transfers between the Ispwich Street line and the Huntington Avenue line's branches. The line was diverted into the new surface transfer station at Massachusetts station on November 28, 1919, where transfers could be made within fare control to the Massachusetts Avenue streetcar line and the Boylston Street subway. The Audubon Road shuttle around 1934 On June 13, 1925, the Ipswich Street line was cut back from Park Street to Massachusetts. It was the last service to run on Boylston Street between Copley Square and Massachusetts; a Bowdoin Square‚ÄìFenway bus route ran in its stead. In March 1926, the Huntington Avenue and Ipswich lines swapped western terminals, with Ipswich Street cars running to Cypress Street. This change restored a one-seat ride from Chestnut Hill to downtown Boston, which had been lost from the 1925 change. As construction of the Worcester Turnpike progressed eastward, the B&W; was replaced by buses on June 11, 1932. That November, the Ipswich Street line was cut back to Brookline Village; the Huntington Avenue line took over the Cypress Street branch until 1934, and buses operated between to Chestnut Hill. In March 1933, the Ipswich Street line was further cut to a shuttle service, with two Type 5 streetcars running between Audubon Road and Massachusetts; a replacement bus route began operation on Brookline Avenue. On July 14, 1934, the shuttle service was converted to buses, ending streetcar service on the Ipswich Street line. =Bus routes= In 1940‚Äì41, the BERy reassigned the public route numbers used for its services; those numbers have remained relatively consistent since. The BERy was replaced in 1947 by the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), which was in return replaced by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) in 1964. Three MBTA bus routes are the descendants of the Ipswich Street line: 55 A route 55 bus on Ipswich Street in 2017 The original bus route that replaced the Aududon Road shuttle followed largely the same route; instead of reversing at Audubon Road, it looped on Kilmarnock Street, Queensbury Street, and Jersey Street through a residential area. It was assigned route number 55 in 1941. From September 1962 to June 1963, inbound buses ran via Brookline Avenue and Kenmore Square. The Massachusetts surface station was closed in January 1963 for construction of the Massachusetts Turnpike Extension, and buses looped via Burbank Street and Hemenway Street. The loop was changed to use Gloucester Street and Newbury Street around 1967; in December 1968, the loop was extended to Fairfield Street to better reach the new Prudential Center. It was extended again to Copley Square in December 1976. Weekday trips were extended to (with a loop around Boston Common) in 1982. Outbound trips were rerouted over Huntington Avenue in June 1998. The MBTA continues to operate the route as 55 Jersey Street & Queensberry Street‚ÄìPark Street station. A 2018‚Äì19 MBTA review of its bus system found that route 55 was little used outside peak hours due to low frequency, unreliable service, and proximity to the Green Line. No short-term changes were recommended. 60 A route 58 or 60 bus at Kenmore Square in the 1940s When the Chestnut Hill streetcar service was discontinued in November 1932, replacement buses operated between Chestnut Hill and Brookline Village. The mid-1933 changes added a Brookline Village‚Äì route on Brookline Avenue; it was through-routed with the Chestnut Hill route around 1934. When Cypress Street service via the Huntington Avenue line ended on June 10, 1934, a Cypress Street‚ÄìKenmore route was added. A loop on High Street, Highland Road, Jamaica Road, Pond Avenue, and Chestnut Street was added in 1935. In 1941, the Cypress Street route was assigned number 58, and the Chestnut Hill route became number 60. The Riverside Line opened in July 1959, and the bus routes were realigned to connect with it. Some route 60 trips had their inbound terminal cut back to Brookline Hills station, and all Cypress Street trips were cut to Brookline Hills as route 60A. A new route 58 operated between Brookline Village and Kenmore. Residents objected to buses looping on narrow streets in Brookline Hills; the routes were changed to terminate at Brookline Village by September 1960. The MTA discontinued free transfers on October 28, 1961, with many routes extended or through-routes to avoid double fares. The Chestnut Hill and Cypress Street routes were re-extended to Kenmore Square, with the Cypress Street route renumbered back to 58. (second page) The two routes were combined as route 60 in September 1969; buses ran on Chestnut Street and High Street except at rush hour, when route 60A ran on the former route 58 alignment. Route 60A was discontinued in December 1985 (thus ending service on the Cypress Street loop), with route 60 operating via Cypress and High at all times. In December 2006, the outer terminal was extended slightly to the Chestnut Hill Mall. The MBTA continues to operate the route as 60 Chestnut Hill‚ÄìKenmore station. The 2018‚Äì19 review found that the route was largely sound, but suffered from poor reliability and inconsistent scheduled headways. A short curtailment of the outer end to a stop at the new Chestnut Hill Square development was recommended, which would allow for increased frequency. The MBTA ultimately did not shorten the route in order to keep service to the mall, though the new stop was to be pursued. 65 A route 65 bus on Brookline Avenue in 2016 Streetcar service on Washington Street between Brookline Village and was originally a branch of the Huntington Avenue line, running to via Beacon Street. The line was shortened to Lake Street‚ÄìBrookline Village on February 6, 1922 and was converted to bus in 1926. In mid-1928, the west end of the route was realigned onto Washington Street to Brighton Center ‚Äì a routing that had been proposed as a streetcar line in the 1890s. The former tracks on Washington Street were removed in 1940. The route was assigned number 65 in 1941. Saturday service was discontinued in March 1953 and restored in September 1979. The route was extended to Kenmore in October 1961 upon the discontinuance of free transfers, running on Brookline Avenue along with routes 58 and 60. The MBTA continues to operate the route as 65 Brighton Center‚ÄìKenmore station. The 2018‚Äì19 review found that the route suffered from poor reliability, high crowding at peak hours, and a lack of Sunday service. Unlike other crosstown routes, peak-hour demand is largely unidirectional. The inner terminal was proposed to be changed to , with buses running on Longwood Avenue, Huntington Avenue, and Ruggles Street (an alignment already used by the ). The change would provide an Orange Line and add additional service to the Longwood Medical Area. However, the MBTA opted to delay the proposal pending further review of the system.

Immediately following his death, protests and riots occurred in dozens of cities across the United States. Protests were staged internationally for the first time on 28 May, with a solidarity demonstration outside the United States Embassy in London. They took place during the UK COVID-19 pandemic, at a time when gatherings of more than six people were banned. Overview Large protests were held across the United Kingdom, particularly in London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle upon Tyne. Many protests were organised by the Black Lives Matter (BLM) and Stand Up to Racism movements. As well as providing solidarity to protests in the United States, many of the ongoing protests in the United Kingdom were highlighting issues with racism faced from law enforcement in the United Kingdom and in daily life. Many protests received endorsement and support from local councils and politicians, including in Liverpool and Oxford. The majority of protests in the United Kingdom were peaceful, although notable clashes between protesters and police occurred on multiple occasions in central London. There were also notable cases of vandalism of historical statues, including graffiti sprayed on the plinth of the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square.Winston Churchill statue desecrated The Daily Express. 8 June 2020. In Bristol, protesters toppled a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston from its pedestal and then pushed it into the harbour on 7 June. Subsequently, the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan established the Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm in order to investigate whether statues on display in London were still suitable for the modern day. The George Floyd protests in the United Kingdom were the largest outside the United States. The protests took place within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, during which there were restrictions in place on public gatherings. Measured by COVID-19 death toll, the United Kingdom was at the time the third-worst affected country globally. During the period of the protests in May and June, public gatherings were legally limited to a maximum of six people, all separated by ,Coronavirus: Are protests legal amid lockdown? BBC News. 8 June 2020. although police forces tolerated the majority of protests despite the restrictions outlawing them. Many protests attempted to follow social distancing, and some handed out masks and gloves to attendees, although there were still concerns that the protests could lead to a second wave of COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom.

Protesters listened to speeches by the leaders of the rally before kneeling for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, the length of time taken to kill George Floyd. In London, thousands of people protested in Trafalgar Square and outside the United States Embassy. The Metropolitan Police had a special policing plan in place for the protest due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and arrested five people outside the embassy: three for violating COVID-19 restrictions and two for assaulting a police officer. During the march from Trafalgar Square to the embassy, four young black men outside Battersea Park railway station climbed on top of a bus stop, took the knee, and raised a fist, which the crowd subsequently copied. In Manchester, hundreds of protesters marched through the city centre to St. Ann's Square, where a rally was held. Protesters were additionally influenced by an incident between Greater Manchester Police officers and Desmond Mombeyarara on 9 May, in which Mombeyarara was tasered by police in front of his young child; footage of the incident at a Stretford petrol station subsequently went viral. In Swansea, a socially distanced Black Lives Matter protest organized by \\"Stand Up To Racism Swansea\\" on Museum Green. = 1 June = In Belfast, around 100 people attended a protest at Belfast City Hall. Multiple rallies were held in the city centre, calling for the state of Minnesota to \\"raise the degree\\", i.e. raise officer Derek Chauvin's murder charge from third-degree to second-degree. The main protest rally was officially rescheduled to 3 June by the organisers due to concerns about a lack of black representation amongst protest leaders, although many people proceeded to gather at the assigned place and time on 1 June anyway. = 2 June = Hundreds of people gathered in The Square, Lower Gardens and outside of the town hall in Bournemouth. The protests remained peaceful, with Dorset Police confirming that no arrests were made. Protest organiser William Wren stated that \\"the issues in Britain are different but our society has a structure very similar to the US\\", and that British people \\"have a responsibility\\" to show solidarity with protests in America.

In Coventry, around 300 people attended a protest rally starting at the city's central police station before marching back into the city centre. West Midlands Police confirmed that they would work with organisers to ensure the protests in the area remained safe and peaceful. Concurrent smaller protests took place across the West Midlands.

Similarly, Leeds City Council and Wakefield Council lit up their civic buildings in purple. = 3 June = Protesters at Trafalgar Square, London on 3 June A large demonstration took place in Hyde Park in central London, attended by hundreds of people. Aerial photos of the protest showed that the participants were largely adhering to social distancing rules, and the Metropolitan Police allowed the protest to progress without incident. Actor John Boyega attended the protest and gave a notable speech, calling out police in the United States over the deaths of George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland and others as well as police in the United Kingdom over their handling of the Stephen Lawrence case in 1993. Demonstrators subsequently left the park and blocked traffic on Park Lane around 15:00, stopping at least ten double-decker buses before being moved along. A stencil drawing of George Floyd's face appeared on a plinth at Speakers' Corner. Clashes erupted later in the evening as part of the protest group advanced further into central London on their way to Parliament Square. Protesters climbed onto windowsills on the walls of the HM Treasury building, spraying Black Lives Matter graffiti on the Treasury and surrounding buildings. At least 13 people were arrested after violent clashes broke out outside the gates to Downing Street, where tensions boiled over as the crowd had gathered to chant at Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Signs, temporary fencing and bottles were thrown over the gates, and groups of protesters attempted to breach them. The Downing Street gates are ordinarily guarded by armed police, although these officers did not take part in the clashes. Further violence erupted after police officers were seen throwing a black protester against a metal railing while attempting to make an arrest. In Brighton, more than 1,000 demonstrators took part in a protest march through the city centre. Protesters gathered in the churchyard of St Nicholas Church before marching to the main central police station in Brighton. Protesters were demanding justice for George Floyd, and chanted that the British law enforcement system was also systematically racist. Police subsequently moved the protest along from the police station to The Level, where demonstrators gathered in a circle and gave impromptu speeches about their own experiences of racism. Sussex Police confirmed that one arrest had been made at the protest, and warned that large gatherings were still illegal under COVID-19 restrictions and that future protests would be dispersed. Protest in Brighton on 3 June Along the coast in Southampton, approximately 500 demonstrators gathered at the city's Guildhall; many wore gloves and masks to protect themselves from COVID-19, however social distancing was observed to falter as the protest went on. Protesters called for justice for Belly Mujinga, a railway ticket office worker at London Victoria station, who died from COVID-19 on 5 April 2020 several days after being racially attacked by a man who falsely claimed to have tested positive for the virus; police at the time stated that they would not be investigating Mujinga's death. In solidarity with the protests, Southampton City Council lit up city buildings in purple. Hundreds of people gathered in South Park in Oxford for a protest which was backed by Layla Moran, Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for the Oxford West and Abingdon constituency, despite her being unable to attend the protest in person.

BLM activists in London are demanding the removal of 60 statues of historical figures like Prime Ministers Charles Grey and William Gladstone, Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson, Sir Francis Drake, King Charles II of England, Oliver Cromwell, Cecil Rhodes and Christopher Columbus. On 5 June, a group of protesters sprayed the abbreviation \\"ACAB\\", meaning All Cops Are Bastards, on the memorial to Earl Haig in Whitehall, London; when soldiers from the Household Cavalry in plain clothes scrubbed the graffiti off, protesters shouted abuse at them for doing so. The statue of Edward Colston in The Centre, Bristol was toppled and thrown into Bristol Harbour on 7 June. On the same day, a protester climbed onto The Cenotaph in London and unsuccessfully attempted to set fire to the Union Flag. On 7 June, the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in London was sprayed by Black Lives Matter protesters with the word \\"Racist\\".  Reaction  Political response = Opposition parties in the House of Commons, including Labour and the Scottish National Party, called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to suspend the export of riot shields, tear gas and other equipment to the United States on 2 June. An open letter was sent to the Prime Minister by Labour MP Emily Thornberry, the Shadow Secretary of State for International Trade, calling the continued supply of riot control equipment to US law enforcement a \\"disgrace\\". Johnson responded stating that he would look into any concerns but insisted that exports are subject to \\"consolidated guidance\\" to ensure they were not misused, and that the UK is the most \\"scrupulous country in the world in that regard\\". The letter was signed by 166 MPs from across all parties in the Commons by 5 June. A petition calling for the suspension of export of riot control equipment has gained more than 500,000 signatures as of 6 June. At the daily Downing Street COVID-19 press conference on 3 June, Boris Johnson stated that he was \\"appalled and sickened\\" by the killing of George Floyd. Johnson said that people had the democratic right to protest, but he \\"urge[d] people to protest peacefully, and in accordance with the rules on social distancing\\" before concluding that racism \\"has no place\\" in society. On 8 June, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement to The Voice in which he stated \\"I will not support or indulge those who break the law, or attack the police, or desecrate public monuments. We have a democracy in this country. If you want to change the urban landscape, you can stand for election, or vote for someone who will.\\" Johnson said that demonstrations were \\"subverted by thuggery\\". Statements also came from several cabinet members, including Priti Patel, who claimed that \\"lawless minority of protesters\\" had \\"regrettably turned to violence\\". On 9 June, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said that he believed statues and plaques in London with links to slavery \\"should be taken down\\", and established the Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm to do so. The statue of Robert Milligan, who was largely responsible for the construction of the West India Docks, was removed on the same day that Khan announced the commission. The petition entitled ‚ÄúRemove the Gandhi Statue in Leicester‚Äô alleges Mahatma Gandhi, the leader of India's independence movement against the British rule, was a racist and sexual predator. British Labour Party politician Keith Vaz said that \\"dreadful\\" petition \\"seeks to divide communities in Leicester and in the country. If this is not withdrawn I will certainly refer it to the police to consider whether it incites racial hatred\\". = Police reaction = In reaction to the protests, the chief constables of multiple police forces across the United Kingdom released the following joint statement on 3 June: Avon and Somerset Police allowed the Statue of Edward Colston to be toppled on 7 June, a decision which caused public backlash. They later justified this, stating that they had made a \\"tactical decision\\" not to intervene, citing concerns that intervention could have led to further violence. = Concerns regarding COVID-19 = There were widespread concerns that the protests across the country could lead to a second wave of COVID-19 cases, just as the United Kingdom was beginning to ease lockdown restrictions, despite calls from protest organisers for attendees to maintain social distancing and wear masks and gloves to protests. Some protests were able to maintain adequate social distancing, although aerial photography of larger gatherings showed that social distancing often broke down as protests progressed. Government and police officials across the devolved nations have urged the public to avoid protests due to COVID-19 concerns. On 5 June, the Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Laurence Taylor, described protests across the United Kingdom as \\"unlawful\\" due to health protection regulations. During the daily Downing Street COVID-19 press conference on the same day, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, said that he was \\"appalled\\" by the killing of George Floyd but urged people not to attend planned protests over the following weekend. However, his comments were largely ignored by the public as protests went ahead as planned. Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice Humza Yousaf said: \\"And we do know there is a lot of evidence of the disproportionate impact that Covid-19 can have on the minority ethnic community. So the very people whose lives we say matter are the very lives that those people could be putting at risk. So yes, it does give me a great deal of concern.\\"  See also  *List of George Floyd protests in the United States *List of George Floyd protests outside the United States  References  Category:COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom United Kingdom Category:May 2020 events in the United Kingdom Category:June 2020 events in the United Kingdom Category:Police brutality in the United Kingdom Category:Protest marches ","title":"George Floyd protests in the United Kingdom"},{"id":"64184135","text":"Peter Rebien (born 25 September 1935) is a German sailor.

Moore's death drew national attention and outrage. Moore was a member of the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation and had recently moved to New Brunswick to be closer to her six-year-old daughter, who was living with Moore‚Äôs mother. The wellness check was asked for by Moore's boyfriend in Toronto, who was worried Moore was being harassed. Police alleged that Moore had a knife and \\"threatened an officer\\", who then fired five times, killing Moore. However, investigators have not released details of the nature of the alleged threat and Edmundston police officers do not wear body cameras. The officer did not attempt to use non-lethal force, a decision that was questioned by Moore's family, who raised concerns about the officer firing five times to stop a woman of small stature alleged to be armed with a knife. Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller commented \\"I don't understand how someone dies during a wellness check.\\" An investigation was initiated into the incident by Quebec's police investigation agency; however, Indigenous leaders have called for an independent public investigation into her death. The killing occurred just over a week after the death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet, an Indigenous-black woman, and caused scrutiny to be raised over Canadian police's capability to de-escalate situations involving mental health crisis. Indigenous leaders, Moore's grandmother, and Minister Miller linked the killing to systemic racism of Indigenous people by Canadian police. In the aftermath of the killing, the chiefs of a coalition of Maliseet First Nations called for an independent probe of the New Brunswick justice system to address systemic discrimination against Indigenous people. Rallies, protests, and healing walks were held across Canada to call for justice for Moore. Eight days after the shooting of Moore, a second Indigenous person, Rodney Levi, was killed by police in New Brunswick. Both deaths led to Premier Blaine Higgs deciding not to proceed with proposed legislation to increase the emergency powers of the police.

Life  Childhood = Weyrauch was born on 20 February 1897 in Leipzig. His mother, Maria Gro√üe, who had received a thorough musical education and worked in several cantor houses, introduced her son to sacred music at an early age. His father, Friedrich Louis Weyrauch, was a merchant by profession and was able to finance his son's attendance of the . Through his stepbrother (from his father's first marriage), Weyrauch got in touch with the music of Richard Wagner, which had a decisive influence on his musical life: :My brother sent me into the Ring when I was 14 years old - with the success that I became Wagner mad. A pedagogical, irreparable mistake, because since that time I have had no proper relationship with most operas. Parallel to his schooling at the Gymnasium, Weyrauch became a pupil of Helene Caspar, a music teacher and writer known around the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, who introduced him to the literature of the First Viennese School and that of Johann Sebastian Bach. In addition to these lessons, the Gewandhaus member Ernst Nissen gave him violin lessons. After ten years of working with Helene Caspar, she realized that she could no longer teach her talented student anything, so she arranged for him to be taught privately by Curt Beilschmidt, who taught theory and piano at the Leipzig Conservatory. When Weyrauch took his Abitur in 1916, it was not possible for him to begin studying music immediately, as he was drafted that same summer and, after training as a machine-gunner, was ordered to serve on the Western Front. After the end of the war, the now 21-year-old returned to Leipzig and realized his plan to study music at the Leipzig Conservatory. = Study period = Weyrauch chose piano as his main subject with the indication to change to the organ later. The lessons were given to him by Robert Teichm√ºller; the music theory teacher was Otto Wittenbacher. Weyrauch took composition lessons with Stephan Krehl, from whose school famous musicians like Rudolf Mauersberger emerged. However, Weyrauch c0hanged composition teachers during the course of his studies and found in Sigfrid Karg-Elert a competent musical personality who appealed to him greatly. Karg-Elert's musical language was initially oriented towards late romantic sounds, but he also mixed these with impressionistic aspirations of Claude Debussy and the sound world of an Alexander Scriabin. In addition to practical and theoretical music studies, Weyrauch also attended musicological lectures and exercises with Hugo Riemann, Hermann Abert and Arnold Schering. In addition to Karg-Elerts polarity theory, Riemann's function theory had a great influence on Weyrauch's first works. In 1922 Weyrauch finished his studies at the Leipzig Conservatory and followed a call to Erlangen, where Wilhelm Becking had established a seminar for musicology. Becking persuaded Weyrauch to write a dissertation with the topic: Der sinfonische Aufbau bei Anton Bruckner, but he did not finish this work. Weyrauch commented on this fact with the following words: :I didn't feel called to be a scientist, but rather a musical practitioner. My compositional urge was stronger than the scientific work. = Start-up = After abandoning his dissertation, Weyrauch returned to Leipzig and now had to consider how he was to make a living, since composing alone did not provide him with enough money to live on. On the recommendation of his former piano teacher Robert Teichm√ºller, Weyrauch was able to accept a position as a lecturer at the Musikverlag Litolff in Braunschweig in 1923. However, he did not devote his full attention to the position, as he was composing during working hours, which led to a disagreement with the chief editor. As a result, Weyrauch quit the position and returned to Leipzig. To secure his livelihood, he gave private piano lessons. One year later Weyrauch married Maria Henriette Luise Winter, who was almost 11 years older than him. In the same year, Weyrauch gained insight into the ideas of the \\"\\" through the mediation of his wife. He came into personal contact with the founders, the singing teacher Clara Schlaffhorst and the piano teacher Hedwig Andersen, and received new impulses for his own vocal work. In addition, Weyrauch was inspired by the German Youth Movement and the that emerged from it. Weyrauch was particularly impressed by the strong influence of the singing movement on Protestant church music, which led to a new discovery Heinrich Sch√ºtz' and the Volksliedes. Weyrauch had personal contact with the two leading figures of the singing movement - Walther Hensel, the founder of the \\"Finkensteiner Bund\\" and Fritz J√∂de, the initiator of the Musicians' Guild. Inspired by the breathing school and the youth music movement, Weyrauch decided to become a music teacher at the Leipzig Volkshochschule. Together with Hans Mlynarczyk, he founded the \\"Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr Musik\\" at the Volkshochschule. Tasks and goals, which were anchored in the spirit of the youth movement, were outlined as follows: :Each listener will develop musically on his own. Nothing is brought to him from the outside, something by talking about music, but everyone makes music himself, everyone feels and senses the basic forces and basic facts of all music. With this proclamation, both founding members rebelled against the common concert business, because in their opinion a passive audience was only a \\"music consuming sham community\\". The work at the adult education centre led to Weyrauch establishing a choir which soon after its foundation gained nationwide recognition. With the help of Karg-Elert, his sphere of activity was expanded in 1929 with a teaching position for music theory at the State Conservatory in Leipzig, which he was only able to hold for a short time, however, as he had to be dismissed due to the dearth of funds. = Life under National Socialism = After losing this post, Weyrauch also lost his main job, as the National Socialists closed all adult education centers shortly after seizure of power in January 1933. Weyrauch's singing circle could only continue to exist if he placed himself under church supervision. By the end of the 1920s he had already begun to concentrate his practical work with the Singkreis as well as his compositional work on the field of church music. Thus the decision matured in him to become a cantor. In 1934 Weyrauch began external organ studies at the Church Music Institute of the Leipzig Academy of Music with Friedrich H√∂gner. Weyrauch had been taking private organ lessons with G√ºnther Ramin since the mid 1920s (student of the Thomas organist Karl Straube). H√∂gner and Ramin, for example, also trained Hugo Distler in Leipzig until he dropped out. In summer 1935 he passed the church music C-examination and took over the part-time position of cantor at the in Leipzig. Shortly before the war, Weyrauch passed the B-examination for church musicians, but he had to leave the cantor's office inactive after the outbreak of the war, as he was called up in 1940 as a state gunner and assigned to guard the prisoners. Already after a few weeks he could take up the office of cantor again - now at the , because he was released into the reserve. Towards the end of the war, Weyrauch had to resume his military service and was taken to the Eastern Front in Poland after radio engineering training. He no longer had to intervene in the war events, because the German troops were already on the retreat. After a six-month war captivity in Schwedt, Weyrauch was able to return to Leipzig, where he resumed his position as cantor and became a member of the younger Thomanerchor at the request of Thomaskantor G√ºnther Ramin voice training. However, Weyrauch soon gave up the position due to an excessive workload. = Turning to church music= Heilandskirche in Leipzig-Plagwitz In October 1946 Weyrauch was appointed as a lecturer in composition and music theory at the rebuilt Leipzig Academy of Music, which was renamed the Mendelssohn Academy. Among his students were Volker Br√§utigam, Diethard Hellmann, Lorenz Stolzenbach and Siegfried Thiele. Dwindling membership in the churches due to the anti-church attitude of the time prompted Weyrauch to compose simpler works which took into account the reduced size of church choirs. Sometimes he composed only 2- or 3-voice movements or even one-voice vocal works with organ accompaniment. In 1951 Weyrauch again took up the position of cantor at the Heilandskirche in Leipzig-Plagwitz and held this position until his voluntary retirement in 1961. He made his position as cantor at the Heilandskirche available to enable his student Volker Br√§utigam to start his professional life immediately. While it was still easy to give up this office, the following year the emeritus weighed far more heavily. Weyrauch was to continue teaching composition and theory for another five years at the Leipzig Academy of Music. After his dismissal as professor, he resigned from the composition association of the GDR, as he had not received any respect or support. 1962 was also the year in which Weyrauch became a member of The Christian Community without leaving the Evangelical Church. In Weyrauch's opinion, the \\"act of consecration of man to the Christian Community is [the] only service in the 20th century\\" that he could accept. = Travel age and last years of life = Grave at the cemetery of Gundorf The retirement age opened up completely new travel opportunities for GDR citizens. Contacts to West German publishing houses were established and friends all over Germany were visited. In 1967 Weyrauch finally ended his teaching activities at the Academy of Music. Also in this year Weyrauch wrote his \\"Musical Testament\\", which contains 15 aphoristic thoughts and represents the essence of his compositional work. The care of his wife, who was already almost blind and in need of care, did not allow Weyrauch to devote himself to composing. The years of care now also led to states of exhaustion and vegetative complaints. At the beginning of 1970 he was admitted to a hospital in Leipzig, but recovered again. On 15 October 1970 his wife Luise died, which is why he only composed a little. In 1972 he moved to a retirement home. After his 80th birthday in 1977, a rapid decline of his physical and mental powers began. Weyrauch died on 1 May 1977 at the age of 80 and was buried at Gundorf Cemetery (near Leipzig). The place at the community centre in , in the district Gundorf of this municipality he lived for several decades, was renamed in his honour \\"Johannes-Weyrauch-Platz\\".  Basic artistic attitude and musical influences  The author of Johannes Weyrauch's biography (Wolfgang Orf) describes the basic musical attitude in this way Weyrauch's biography makes it easy to see that there is an artistic-spiritual relationship between his basic Christian attitude and his work that is never abandoned. This relationship is particularly expressed through the reflection on certain categories of values: clarity, avoidance of all superfluous things and the use of economical and simple musical means. His tonal language seems conventional, it is not rich in surprising turns. He does not work towards moods, gives no impressions and renounces tonal opulence in favour of a clear, transparent sound. Extensive experiments are as alien to his music as one- sided musical driving forces, if one disregards some works from his early creative period. In that Weyrauch's music is simple, avoids excessive loudness, effect, sound voluptuousness and voluptuousness, it possesses a high degree of clarity, comprehensibility and expressiveness. The simplicity and deliberate simplicity of the musical style, especially in the late works, is by no means a lack of craftsmanship, but the result of a long personal and thus also artistic maturation period. Weyrauch himself speaks of four stages of development that characterize his work. Artistically, there are no hard breaks or extreme reorientations, which is why the style periods flow into each other and have developed naturally. The stylistic periodicity is structured as follows: :1st period from 1920 to 1925: Expressive style :2nd period from 1926 to 1946: Simplified, moderate style :3rd period from 1947 to 1958: Paupert√§t style :4th period from 1959 to 1977: style of mirrored intellectual ideas The expressive style of the early phase is influenced by his Leipzig teachers, who felt committed to the music of the 19th century and had a central role model in Max Reger. But not only Reger, but also Alexander Scriabin served Weyrauch - especially in the field of (extended) harmonics and counterpoint - as an ideal in this period. The functioned as a counterpart to the music of the 19th century, since it dismissed it as light music or empty, virtuoso performance music and sought its salvation in the music of the \\"Old Masters\\" - for example Heinrich Sch√ºtz, but also Johann Sebastian Bach - and their genres and forms. Their endeavour was to make music accessible and practise it together and to overcome the separation between the (anonymous) audience and the performing musicians. Due to the return to (pre)baroque compositional techniques, the horizontal, harmonic compositional thinking of the 19th century was replaced by a linear voice leading, a process that can also be traced in Weyrauch's early compositions. The harmonically complex sound structures, as he was taught in the \\"Leipzig School\\", are taken back by the contact with the singing movement in his second creative period and replaced by clear chords with tonal roots. In the third creative period, the simplifying tendencies intensify, resulting in a further reduction in the complexity of the melodic structure, which is why Weyrauch himself coined the word \\"Paupert√§t style\\" for his music of this period. Archaic elements such as motifs influenced by Gregorian chant or free-flowing melodies that are not subordinated to a rigid bar scheme characterize the compositions. In addition to the stylistic reorientation, the anti-Christian basic attitude promoted in the GDR also led to a loss of members in the churches, which is why Weyrauch wrote simple movements for small ensembles for practical reasons. He described his last creative period as a \\"style of mirrored spiritual ideas\\", in which he dispensed with decorative elements in the individual voices in favour of clear diction in the overall arrangement of the works. The tonal language, which becomes harsher and more brittle, deliberately dispenses with \\"musical beauty\\" and places the meditative element more strongly in the foreground. This last style period represents a culmination of all compositional styles. As was already evident in the classification of the stylistic periods of Weyrauch, various compositional currents flow into his oeuvre. However, the surroundings of Leipzig with its great names such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Robert Schumann and Max Reger also exerted an obligatory influence. A central course was already set after the first compositions, as the decision against the avant-garde was made here. The four piano pieces (WeyWV 8), which take up the tonal language of Scriabin, could have become Weyrauch's foundation stone in overcoming tonality. But instead of following this widespread trend, a conscious departure from this method of composition was made in favour of a turn towards a traditional musical language that is quiet, meditative and free of all obtrusiveness and externalities. Three worldviews - anthroposophy, The Christian Community and the Berneuchen Movement - also determined Weyrauch's essence and work. The spiritual worldview of anthroposophy, founded by Rudolf Steiner, who was interested in Weyrauch as a silent observer, seeks an individual, yet systematic approach to phenomena of the supersensible world. Inspired by this doctrine, but nevertheless understood as an independent religious community, the Christian Community, which was founded by theologians under the guidance of Friedrich Rittelmeyer and with the help of Rudolf Steiner, has become apparent. The Berneuchener Kreis, which came into being around 1920, was an evangelical movement whose aim was to reform the church and to resacralize everyday life. During his almost sixty-year creative period, Weyrauch left behind an extensive ≈ìuvre of 100 operas, with a focus on Musica sacra. In addition to music for wind and string instruments, compositions for organ dominate the instrumental music. Numerous meditations, chorale preludes and partitas to church songs testify to Weyrauch's basic religious attitude. In the field of vocal music, too, a clear predominance of sacred music can be observed; here, the preference for choral music is conspicuous, while solo works are hardly to be found. Above all motets, introits and cantatas to sacred or biblical texts dominate the picture, whereas large forms such as oratorios, masses or passions are almost completely absent. All the organ works have been recorded by the cantor Michael Vetter on a total of three CDs. In contrast, only one CD with selected vocal works exists, which was recorded by the Leipzig Vocal Ensemble under the direction of the Thomaskantor Georg Christoph Biller in cooperation with the Central German Chamber Orchestra. Biller, who was still able to experience Weyrauch personally, was commissioned by the latter shortly before his death to maintain and perform his works. Many works have been published by various publishing houses, including the Musikverlag Joachim Kaschta, Carus-Verlag and Breitkopf & H√§rtel.

Upon arrival in Piraeus on 8 March 1939 she was renamed Nea Hellas (\\"New Greece\\"). She was refitted for service between Piraeus and New York and entered service on 19 May 1939. In 1940 Italy and Germany invaded Greece. The UK Ministry of Shipping requisitioned Nea Hellas as a troop ship and contracted Anchor Line to manage her. After seven years in government service the UK Ministry of War Transport released her back to Goulandris Brothers after the end of the war.

Biography After meeting with Shah Jalal, Adam decided to accompany him in his expedition across the Indian subcontinent to propagate the religion of Islam. In 1303, he took part in the final battle of the Conquest of Sylhet under Shah Jalal's leadership against Raja Gour Govinda. Following the victory, Shah Jalal ordered his companions to disperse across Eastern Bengal and surrounding areas. Adam migrated to the modern-day village of Deorail in Badarpur where he preached to the local people. Legacy It is unclear how and what year he died, but he was buried in a dargah in Badarpur, Karimganj, in close proximity to the modern-day Badarpur railway station. A mosque was built within the complex, and it became a notable site in Badarpur attracting Muslims and Hindus alike. Those attached to the maqam of Adam Khaki were given Pirmuttara land grants. Nur Ali (1880-1963) of Gorkapon in Badarpur was a noteworthy Mawlana who requested Abdul Latif Chowdhury Fultali to visit the mosque. In 1946, Fultali announced that he would be travelling to Badarpur to give a lesson on qira'at at the mosque.

The line operates every 30-35 minutes during the weekday peak hours only. Route Z2 trips are roughly 60-70 minutes long. Background Route Z2 operates during the weekday peak-hours only between Silver Spring station and Olney via MedStar Montgomery Medical Center, Ashton, Colesville, and White Oak. The route mainly operates along Colesville Road and New Hampshire Avenue providing service within those neighborhoods. Route Z2 currently operates out of Montgomery division. History Route Z2 originally operated Silver Spring-Wheaton Line under the Capital Transit Company. The line originally operated between Silver Spring and Wheaton. The line was transfer to buses in the 1940s but was later discontinued. The Colesville‚ÄìAshton Line was originally operated under route Z1 which operates as Streetcars. The line was later formed by buses in June 1956, renamed route Z2, and acquired by DC Transit. The line was later acquired by WMATA on February 4, 1973. Routes Z2 operated alongside the Z1, Z3, and Z4 as the Colesville Line. Route Z2 operated between Silver Spring and Olney with select trips ending in Cloverly. =1978 Changes= On February 19, 1978, route Z2 alongside the Z1, Z3, and Z4 were extended to Silver Spring station after the station opened on February 6, 1978. =Simplification of Line= Through the 1980s to 1990s, routes Z1, Z3, and Z4 were separated from the Colesville Line and formed into different routes. Routes Z1 and Z4 were formed into the Glenmont‚ÄìSilver Spring Line to operate between Silver Spring station and Glenmont station. Route Z3 and Z5 will operate between Silver Spring and Burtonsville Park and Ride. Route Z2 will remain under the Colesville Line being extended to Olney. =Saturday Ride On Service= In September 1993, Ride On took over Saturday service for the Z2, under the Colesville ‚Äì Silver Spring Line. The reason was for WMATA to reduce costs and apply buses to more higher ridership routes. =2004 Changes= After a series of proposals in April 2004, route Z2 was rerouted to serve Briggs Chaney Road, Good Hope Road and Cape May Road instead of operating directly via New Hampshire Avenue replacing Z3. Weekday midday and Saturday Z2 trips will only operate between Silver Spring station and Colesville. Route Z2 would be renamed the Colesville‚ÄìAshton Line as a result of the changes. =2007 Changes= On June 24, 2007, route Z2 was rerouted to remain on New Hampshire Avenue between Briggs Chaney and Cape May roads. Service along Good Hope and Cape May roads will be discontinued and replaced by Ride On route 39. =2009 Changes= On June 28, 2009, most off-peak service for route Z2 was discontinued due to low ridership. Weekday peak-hour service and Saturday service still operate. =2012 Proposed Changes= In 2012, WMATA proposed to eliminate all Saturday Z2 service and on the four federal holidays on which a Saturday schedule is operated. This was due to unduplicated segment of Saturday Z2 (between Bonifant Road / Good Hope Road and Randolph Road) that serves very few passengers and most of Saturday Z2 is served by another route with capacity to accommodate current Z2 riders. Alternative service will be provided by routes C8 and Z8. =2013 Changes= In December 2012, WMATA announced that all weekend Z2 trips operated by Ride On will be eliminated on January 12, 2013 due to low ridership. Alternative service would be provided by routes C8 and Z8. =2015 Changes= When the Paul S. Sarbanes Transit Center at Silver Spring station opened, route Z2 was rerouted from its bus stop along Wayne Avenue to Bus Bay 113 at the transit center on the first level sharing the bay with route Z6. =Proposed Elimination= In 2019, WMATA proposed to eliminate all route Z2 service as it will overlap the upcoming Ride On Flash BRT service along U.S. Route 29 that is slanted to open in 2020 plus other services. Overall average of 25 riders per weekday trip according to WMATA. Controversy Montgomery County expressed concerns over the proposed changes. According to Council Vice President Tom Hucker, residents impact 65,000 residents of the Maryland county. Residents urged WMATA to not cut service as it will cause a lack of transportation towards the residents. At least 30 Montgomery County leaders called on WMATA not to cut Metrobus routes in the region, saying it will \\"disproportionately affect\\" students, seniors, and service workers with no other source of transportation. The letter's signatories include state senators Craig Zucker, Susan Lee, and Cheryl Kagan, Maryland State Delegates Marc Korman, Sara Love, and Julie Palakovich Carr and all nine members of the county council. In a letter to Metro Chairman Paul Smedberg, members of the Montgomery County Council and state delegation said they opposed the cuts, which are part of WMATA's proposed FY 2021 operating budget, and urged the agency to prioritize \\"maintaining frequent and reliable service.\\" They also quote; The Metrobus routes currently recommended for service reductions, including the Q, J, L and Z bus lines, provide transportation for many of our most transit-dependent residents,\\" the lawmakers wrote. \\"Service reductions will disproportionately affect students commuting to Montgomery College, seniors running daily errands and service workers accessing jobs. Roughly 65,000 Montgomery riders use Metrobus on a daily basis, and for many these bus routes are their only source of transportation. The 35 lawmakers ended the letter by saying cuts to Metrobus service for Montgomery County would counter their \\"regional goals of reducing traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions.\\" On April 2, 2020, WMATA backed off from the proposal due to customer opposition.

Peraza was also the territorial lord of the islands of La Gomera and El Hierro. Biography Hern√°n Peraza the Younger was born in the city of Seville in approximately 1450. He was the son of Diego Garc√≠a de Herrera and In√©s Peraza de las Casas, lords of the Canary Islands by inheritance of his grandfather, Hern√°n Peraza the Elder, and therfore part of the influential Peraza family that was significant in the history of the Canary Islands. In 1477 he began to govern the island of La Gomera on behalf of his parents, settled in Lanzarote, and the island was officially handed over to him the following year. Peraza would face several uprisings of the aborigines in the following years, motivated by his despotic government. \\"Torre del Conde\\" (\\"Tower of the Count\\"), the residence tower of Hern√°n Peraza the Younger, originally constructed by his grandfather Hern√°n Peraza The Elder in 1450. In the month of May 1481, Captain Juan Rej√≥n accidentally arrived on the island with his family and few men, being well received by the Gomeran people of Mulagua. Rej√≥n however, had previously been in a confrontation with Peraza‚Äôs father, Diego de Herrera, in 1479, when Rej√≥n went to the island of Lanzarote to ask for Herrera's help, but he did not accept because he was accompanied by the vassals of the lord that they had provoked with their acts in the well-known ‚ÄúPesquisa de Cabitos‚Äù (‚ÄúSearch/quest for goats‚Äù) which determined the ownership of the conquered islands. The historian Juan de Abr√©u Galindo, claims it was Hern√°n, by order of his father, who did not allow Rej√≥n to disembark in the port of Arrecife. Therefore when Peraza, who had become estranged from his father Diego de Herrera years earlier, learns of the presence of the captain he sends several vassals to arrest him and bring him into his presence. Rej√≥n refuses and each confronts the other with the result of Rej√≥n being speared to death. Elvira de Sotomayor, Rej√≥n's widow, and other relatives filed complaints in court against Peraza for the murder of the captain, being called to the presence of the Catholic Monarchs. As conditions for royal forgiveness, achieved through the intercession of Peraza's high-level friends and relatives in court, he was forced to marry Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ulloa-Ossorio, and also made to collaborate in the conquest of Gran Canaria that was taking place at that time. Thus, in 1482 Peraza marched to Agaete with about eighty of his Gomeran vassals, the translator Juan Mayor, and about 70-80 men left by his father from Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, and collaborates with Alonso Fern√°ndez de Lugo. Together they manage to capture the king (or guanarteme) of G√°ldar, Tenesor Semid√°n, who after being baptized collaborates with the conquerors attracting many of his former vassals, leading to the consummation of the conquest soon after. After the conquest of Gran Canaria in 1483, Peraza returned to La Gomera. At this time, he made an alliance pact - \\"Guahedun pact\\" - with the Gomeran cantons that did not recognize him as lord. This agreement, which Peraza and the Castilians understood as an act of submission, consisted of a symbolic twinning between Peraza and the gomeros when drinking milk from the same vessel. In 1486 Peraza received the island of El Hierro from his mother, In√©s Peraza, and in 1488 the mayorazgo of the Canary Islands. That same year Peraza was besieged in the tower of San Sebasti√°n by the rebellious Gomeras, requesting through his mother the help of the Governor of Gran Canaria, Pedro de Vera. Aborigines are defeated, retaliated against, and sold as slaves. The stately abuses of Peraza, as well as the exposure of his scandalous affair with Yballa, an Aboriginal on the side of Ipalan - and his \\"sister\\" under the Guahedun pact - led to his being tried and executed by the Gomeran warrior and leader Hautacuperche, a cousin of Yballa who then led the Gomeran rebellion of 1488. Peraza's death shortly after and the following lawsuits between his widow and his mother, caused the later to revoke the mayorazgo in 1503, just before her death early in the year. Personal life Hern√°n Peraza the Younger was a member of the Peraza family that was an influential force in Seville and the Canary Islands. In an arranged marriage, Peraza wed the Lady of the Court Beatriz de Bobadilla by order of Queen Isabella I of Castile in 1482. Beatriz was of the powerful and wealthy Bobadilla family yet had earned the notorious nickname ‚ÄúThe Huntress‚Äù for her rumored high-profile affairs with Isabella‚Äôs husband King Ferdinand II of Aragon and, later on, Christopher Columbus. This marriage was one of the conditions for Peraza to obtain royal forgiveness for his participation in the murder of Captain Juan Rej√≥n. The couple had a son, Guill√©n Peraza de Ayala, who was later made the first Count of La Gomera, as well as a daughter, In√©s de Herrera y Ayala, who married Pedro Fern√°ndez de Lugo, second Adelantado de Canarias. Peraza was killed by the warrior Hautacuperche on November 20, 1488 during the aforementioned Gomeran rebellion.

Like most streets in New Orleans, the segment of the parkway to the north east of Canal Street is named \\"North\\" Jefferson Davis Parkway while the segment to the southwest is denoted as \\"South\\". The parkway is wide with a grassy median except for where it crosses over the Pontchartrain Expressway. History The parkway was proposed in 1904 as a \\"speedway\\" connecting the city's two major public parks, Audubon Park and City Park. Part of the parkway was to be laid on Hagan Avenue which was named for John Hagan, a New Orleans merchant and land speculator who was in a real estate partnership with the Marquis de Lafayette. Fauburg Hagan, the area developed by Hagan in 1841, is a few blocks from Hagan Avenue and is now referred to as Tulane/Gravier. In 1910, a 20-block portion of Hagan Avenue was renamed for Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America who died in New Orleans in 1889. The remainder of Hagan Avenue continues to the northeast for eight more blocks parallel to Bayou St. John (one block east of Moss Street).

O'Connor was an immigrant from Ireland to the United States. The hanging occurred after an attempted lynching of O'Connor on May 19, 1834. The O'Connor case and others like it showed that there was a need for formal laws on Iowa land. The trial of O'Connor was the first murder trial in Iowa. Murder of O'Keaf O'Connor was born in Ireland in 1797 and immigrated to Galena, Illinois, in 1826. Two years after arriving in the United States, he fractured his leg which resulted in a doctor amputating it. It is believed that this incident caused O'Connor to become \\"quarrelsome and a trouble maker\\". He shot a merchant, who survived the encounter. Some men wanted to lynch O'Connor, but they decided not to do so when O'Connor promised to them that he would leave Galena. After leaving Galena, O'Connor traveled to Dubuque, Michigan Territory, to work in the lead mines. In 1833, during his time mining, O'Connor met fellow Irishman George O'Keaf. The two men built a cabin that was two miles south of Dubuque. On May 19, 1834, O'Keaf traveled to Dubuque to gather supplies and returned to the cabin with one of his friends at close to 2pm. After O'Connor, who was inside of the cabin at the time, refused to unlock the door, O'Keaf busted the door open with his shoulder. O'Connor was sitting in a bench that was on the opposite side of the door and he killed O'Keaf after shooting him once with a musket. The friend of O'Keaf went to the nearest cabin to tell them about the murder that had just happened. When multiple miners asked O'Connor why he shot O'Keaf, his only responses were \\"That is my business\\" and then ordered them to bury O'Keaf. Some of the miners wanted to hang O'Connor, but others wanted a trial. O'Connor was then taken to Dubuque. Trial The trial was held on May 20, 1834, making it the first murder trial in Iowa. O'Connor was given the right to select the jury and the trial took place outside under an elm tree. The jury, while sitting on a log, listened to the testimonies of witnesses. After the arguments from attorneys of both the prisoner and the prosecution, the jury declared that O'Connor was guilty of first degree murder. O'Connor was sentenced to be hanged on June 20, 1834. During the month after the trial, it was attempted for the crime to be pardoned or for there to be a commutation of the sentence. However, the governor of Missouri stated that he did not have the power to grant a pardon and President Andrew Jackson said that \\"Congress had not extended the laws of the United States to that part of the country\\". At 1pm on June 20, 1834, O'Connor was hanged. Aftermath Because of this incident and others like it, Congress provided laws for the Iowa territory. On June 28, 1834, President Jackson approved an act which extended the \\"boundaries of Michigan to the Missouri and White Earth rivers and embracing all the territory between the northern boundary of Missouri and the Forty- Ninth Parallel\\". Even though the act came too late to help O'Connor, it made it so that the people of the Black Hawk Purchase would have the authority and protection of the United States.

In 2005 she started working on electromagnetically induced transparency, light matter entanglement and development of quantum memories in atomic ensembles. After demonstrating the capability of vapours to store quantum states of light, she started working on quantum memory register based on a cold atom cloud. From 1998 to the present she has been working on semiconductor microcavities and on the study of nonlinear and bi-stable behavior. In passive semiconductor microcavities, she demonstrated, for the first time, the emission of squeezed light and correlated beams. From 2001 to the present she has been involved in the studies of semiconductor nano-crystals, specifically on single photon generation and cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects. In this line of research, concerning semiconductor systems, she studied intensity quantum noise in semiconductor lasers and explained how to reduced it.

She is an associate professor of Medicine and Director of Women's Cardiovascular Health at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Michos is also an Associate Faculty of the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research at Johns Hopkins, and has a joint faculty appointment in the Department of Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Michos is an honorary fellow for the American Heart Association (FAHA), the American College of Cardiology (FACC), the American Society of Echocardiography (FASE), and the American Society of Preventive Cardiology (FASPC). During her tenure at Johns Hopkins, Michos has authored or co-authored over 300 manuscripts or book chapters published in peer-reviewed journals/textbooks. Personal life and education Michos earned her medical degree from Northwestern University and her Master's in public health (MHS) from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. After earning her MHS, Michos became a clinical fellow at Johns Hopkins, where she co-authored an editorial with Dr. Roger S. Blumenthal titled Further improvements in CHD risk prediction for women. The editorial was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and argued for improvements to be made to the criteria in assessing postmenopausal womans' chances of developing cardiovascular diseases. Michos is half Italian and married to a Greek husband. She competes in marathons during her time off. Career Michos joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 2007 as an instructor in their Division of Cardiology. She was promoted to assistant professor the following year. On July 1, 2008, Michos received the Clinician Scientist Award, which granted her $40,000, and American College of Cardiology Foundation/Pfizer Career Development Award, which granted her $65,000 over three years. In 2011, she was awarded a $1 million grant over four years from the National Institutes of Health National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) to evaluate the association of vitamin D with brain health outcomes. By May 2014, Michos was promoted to Associate professor. Michos has participated in multiple national and international society guidelines and position statements including the 2019 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline to update recommendations for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. She has also been a co- author on a 2017 AHA Scientific Statement on Meditation and Cardiovascular Risk Reduction, and the 2017 American Diabetes Association (ADA) position statement on Hypertension management. Michos has been chosen to sit on the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Prevention Leadership Council and the Board of Directors for the American Society of Preventive Cardiology (ASPC). She also became an associate editor on the journal Circulation and for the American Journal of Preventive Cardiology (AJPC). She is an honorary fellow for the American Heart Association (FAHA), the American College of Cardiology (FACC), the American Society of Echocardiography (FASE), and the American Society of Preventive Cardiology (FASPC). =Research= As an assistant professor, Michos was a co-lead investigator on a study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine which found that inadequate levels of vitamin D could lead to a 26 percent increased risk of death. Michos and her colleagues came to this conclusion by analyzing data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and people's vitamin D levels at the time of death. She also completed another study in November where she studied if there was a correlation between changes in coronary artery calcium and levels of sex hormones. The study concluded that men who produced natural sex hormones ran a higher risk of developing atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries. It also found that older women who produced high levels of estrogen were more likely to develop coronary artery calcium. In 2009, Michos and Blumenthal used data collected from the JUPITER trial to research how many United Stated patients with low-cholesterol and high-C-reactive protein would benefit from digesting statin. They gathered data generated by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1971 to 2009 of patients who fit the JUPITER trial requirements and concluded that 6.5 million older adults would benefit. The following year, Michos introduced data collected from a 14-year study of over 8,000 white and black adults which concluded that unlike for white people, low vitamin D was not the cause for the higher rate of strokes amongst black adults. Upon earning a promotion to associate professor, Michos published in the Journal of American Heart Association (JAHA) an observational study that linked the use of calcium supplements (but not calcium in diet) with increased risk of developing calcification in the coronary (heart) arteries. This was followed up in 2018 when her team evaluated data from 18 studies involving over 2 million participants and found that no evidence for any cardiovascular benefit from multivitamin use. By 2019, her team led a study testing the legitimacy and quality of supplements aimed at improving heart health or lengthening life. Using data collected from 277 clinical trials, she concluded that the most effective supplements with possible health benefits only derived from a low-salt diet, omega-3 fatty acid supplements, and possibly folic acid supplements. It also found that supplements combining calcium and vitamin D could lead to an increased risk of stroke. Michos simultaneously conducted studies for the betterment of women's cardiovascular health by examining how sex hormones can influence cardiovascular risk in women. In 2018, she and her research team published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC) their findings that women after menopause who have higher testosterone levels are at increased risk for cardiovascular events such as heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure, even after taking into account lifestyle factors and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. She also completed another study in 2019 where she studied if there was a correlation between changes in coronary artery calcium and levels of sex hormones. The study concluded that older women who produced higher levels of testosterone were more likely to develop coronary artery calcium, a marker of atherosclerosis. Additionally, her team examined national survey data and found that women with cardiovascular disease were more likely to report that they had poor experiences with their healthcare compared to similar men. In this study, women patients were more likely to report they had poor communication with their doctors and that they felt their doctors did not respect or listen to them, compared to men. Furthermore, pharmacy data confirmed that women were also sub-optimally treated for their cardiovascular disease and were under-prescribed established preventive medications. In July 2019, Michos co-authored a study testing the legitimacy and quality of supplements aimed at improving heart health or lengthening life. Using data collected from 277 clinical trials, she concluded that the most effective supplements with possible health benefits only derived from a low-salt diet, omega-3 fatty acid supplements, and possibly folic acid supplements. It also found that supplements combining calcium and vitamin D could lead to an increased risk of stroke. She also found that women with a history of multiple live births (five or more) were less likely to be in ideal cardiovascular health once they reach middle or older ages. In another study, which was published in JAMA Network Open, she found that more than half of women with cardiovascular disease do not meet recommended physical activity goals and that was associated with increased health care expenditure. In 2020, Michos helped develop the Kardashian Index as a way to measure the discrepancy between a cardiologists social media profile and publication record. She also published a study in the journal Circulation that examined the enrollment of women physicians in cardiology training programs for the past decade and found there has been a stagnation of progress, with only 21% of cardiology fellowship trainees being women which improved very little across the past decade. In this paper, she describes opportunities to improve recruitment of women into the field of cardiology through mentorship and sponsorship activities.
