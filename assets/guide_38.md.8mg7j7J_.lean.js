According to tradition, it was named after Dunod, a son of the founding father of Gwynedd - Cunedda Wledig - who drove the Irish settlers from the area in c.460. The territory existed as a subordinate realm within Gwynedd until the line of rulers descended from Dunod expired in c.925. Following the end of the House of Dunod, it was split into the cantrefi of Eifionydd and Ardudwy and fully incorporated into Gwynedd.

Executive Director Krishanti Dharmaraj is also the founder of the Dignity Index and co-founder of WILD for Human Rights and the Sri Lanka Children's Fund. The former executive director, Radhika Balakrishnan, is now the faculty director, and a professor in the Department of Women's and Gender Studies at Rutgers, chair of the Board of the US Human Rights Network, and a board member of the Center for Constitutional Rights. Located on Douglass Residential College (formerly Douglass College) at Rutgers University, CWGL is a unit of International Programs within the School of Arts and Sciences and is a member of the Institute for Women's Leadership, a consortium of women's programs at Rutgers. About the center The CWGL is both an academic center at a major public research university as well as a non-governmental organization with ECOSOC Special Consultative Status at the United Nations working on policy and advocacy. CWGL works to develop and facilitate women's leadership worldwide not only for women's human rights, but also for international social justice. *Violence against women *Sexual and reproductive health *Socio-economic well- being Integrating gender and women's human rights into the work of local, national, regional and international institutions, CWGL's programs inform and mobilize advocates for women's human rights around specific events and build linkages among them to enhance their capacity to influence policy making. Much of the Center's programmatic work stems from footholds made at the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights and the 1995 Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women. Working in collaboration with women leaders and NGOs around the world‚Äîwhether at UN meetings such as the Commission on the Status of Women, international mobilization campaigns, such as the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence,Every Human Has Rights, CWGL Page or through global education endeavors‚ÄîCWGL has helped secure international policy commitments that clearly state \\"women's rights are human rights\\". With these policy benchmarks in place, the Center has turned its energy toward implementation of this concept and holding policy making bodies accountable to their promises to the world's women. Core activities in this program area include UN Monitoring and Advocacy and the coordination of international mobilization campaigns. With its new executive director in place, the Center is continuing with programmatic work on ending violence against women, protecting women human rights defenders, and encouraging UN reform with a new body to monitor the realization of women's human rights. Moreover, the Center is expanding into considerations of the application of macroeconomic policies and the relationship between women and development within a human rights framework. At Rutgers University In addition to bridging the worlds of academia and activism, CWGL spans two different areas of academia at Rutgers University, and the Center is a unit of International Programs within the School of Arts and Sciences. The CWGL has a special position within this department because the other programs of the Office of International Programs are either focused on the United Nations or broken up into regional studies with regional scopes. Thus, the CWGL plays a unique role by fostering women's leadership globally and having an international scope. The CWGL is also a member of the Institute for Women's Leadership (IWL), a consortium of eight women's programs at Rutgers University created to study and promote how and why women lead, and to develop programs that prepare women of all ages to lead effectively. =Poster collection= The Margery Somers Foster Center, Rutgers University Libraries, in collaboration with the Department of Women's and Gender Studies and the Center for Women's Global Leadership (CWGL), both of the School of Arts and Sciences, have developed the Poster Collection portal, which provides digitized access to approximately 300 posters published by women's rights organizations worldwide and housed at CWGL. The posters chronicle 20 years of transnational women's activism and advocacy, while documenting evolving issues of the global women's movement. The digital repository is housed in RUcore, the Rutgers Community Institutional Repository, an online archive, where they are accessible to all. The American Library Association recognized the CWGL poster collection in 2012, and were awarded the 2012 Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Women and Gender Studies Section (WGSS) Award for Significant Achievement in Woman's Studies Librarianship. The collection is also featured on Discovering American Women's History Online. At the United Nations At the United Nations, CWGL plays a major role at various meetings addressing the implementation of commitments from world conferences including the Vienna Conference (1993), Cairo Hearing on Reproductive Health and Human Rights, Copenhagen Hearing on Economic Justice and Women's Human Rights, and the Beijing Conference, particularly at the UN Commission on the Status of Women, the UN Human Rights Council, and at the reviews of these UN World Conferences. There are several critical meetings at the United Nations that serve as important opportunities for women's human rights advocates to assess successes and failures in implementing commitments to women. As an ECOSOC accredited NGO, the CWGL participates directly in roundtables organized by the NGO Committee on the Status of Women in preparation for each session of the Commission on the Status of Women. In this capacity, the CWGL plays a multifaceted role by: *Facilitating planning sessions in which women's human rights defenders and advocates can both monitor and contribute to meetings effectively *Convening a women's human rights caucus and other gatherings *Organizing monitoring and other advocacy training *Sending out alerts and reports both before and after such meetings In March 2007, the Women's Environment & Development Organization (WEDO), together with the Center for Women's Global Leadership, convened a meeting of 50 women activists from around the world to develop a comprehensive and multi-faceted strategy for global, regional and national action to gain the UN General Assembly's approval of a stronger, single, fully resourced women's entity at the UN. As a result of that meeting and the continued need for women's collaborative advocacy on this issue, WEDO and the CWGL, along with hundreds of activists spanning all regions, launched the Gender Equality Architecture Reform (GEAR) campaign in February 2008, to mobilize women's groups and allies to push for the adoption of the new UN entity for gender equality and women's empowerment. On June 30, 2010, the United Nations General Assembly resolution was agreed to and subsequently formally adopted by the General Assembly on Friday, July 2, to establish \\"UN Women\\", the new gender equality entity at the UN. International mobilization campaigns16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence= The 16 Days of Activism against Gender Violence Campaign was launched by CWGL in 1991 as an annual campaign that demands the elimination of all forms of violence against women. This rallying cry erupts annually between November 25 and December 10, and more than 3,700 organizations participate in the event from approximately 164 countries. The dates of the campaign align with significant dates, including: *November 25 ‚Äì International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women *November 29 ‚Äì International Women Human Rights Defenders Day *December 1 ‚Äì World AIDS Day *December 5 ‚Äì International Volunteer Day for Economic and Social Development *December 6‚ÄìMarks the anniversary of the Montreal Massacre, observed in Canada as the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women *December 10 ‚Äì International Human Rights Day and the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights =Global Campaigns for Women's Human Rights= The Center for Women's Global Leadership interacts with a community of women's human rights defenders in order to place pressure on local, national, and international decision-making bodies. Global campaigns usually emphasize that \\"women's rights are human rights\\", and are supported by thousands of individuals and organizations from around the world. These constituencies rally to take action to protect individual rights defenders and advocates in countries from Serbia to Iran. Activities include a series of Global Tribunals, petitions, and \\"Take Action\\" kits. Additionally, the Center also holds public forums to conduct assessments of the women's human rights movement. One such event was the \\"International Strategic Directions Consultation\\" that took place in November 2003 as part of the Vienna + 10 Updates. Women Human Rights Defenders International Coalition The Women Human Rights Defenders International Coalition is a resource and advocacy network for the protection and support of women human rights defenders worldwide. When their gender or the nature of their work has made them the subject of attacks, gender-sensitive mechanisms are required for their protection and support. The Coalition involves women activists as well as men who defend women's rights and lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, and transgender (LGBT) defenders and groups committed to the advancement of women's human rights and sexual rights. The Coalition is currently composed of 28 members: Amnesty International (AI); Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD); Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (Forum Asia); Association for Progressive Communications Women's Networking Support Programme; Association for Women's Rights in Development (AWID); Baobab for Women's Human Rights; The Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR); Center for Women's Global Leadership (CWGL); Coalition of African Lesbians (CAL); Front Line International Foundation for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders (Front Line); Human Rights First; Information Monitor (Inform); International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH); International Service for Human Rights (ISHR); International Women's Rights Action Watch Asia Pacific (IWRAW‚ÄêAP); Isis International; ISIS‚ÄêWomen's International Cross‚ÄêCultural Exchange (ISIS‚ÄêWICCE); Just Associate (JASS); The Latin American and Caribbean Committee for the Defense of Women's Rights (CLADEM); MADRE; Nazra for Feminist Studies; Peace Brigades International; Rainbow Rights Project (R-Rights); Urgent Action Fund for Women's Human Rights (UAF); Women's Global Network for Reproductive Rights; Women's Initiatives for Gender Justice (WIGJ); Women's Rehabilitation Centre; Women Living Under Muslim Laws (WLUML); World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT).

Membership represents one-quarter of the private sector jobs in California and includes firms of all sizes and companies from every industry within the state. The CalChamber provides products and services to help businesses and human resources (HR) professionals comply with both federal and state employment law. As a not-for- profit organization with roots dating to 1890, the CalChamber promotes international trade and investment to stimulate California's economy and create jobs. CalChamber has over 14,000 members, who collectively employ one quarter of the private sector workforce in California. Three-quarters of CalChamber's members have 100 or fewer employees. Board of directors The members of the CalChamber's Board of Directors are elected by the CalChamber‚Äôs members and are ranking executives in their organizations, representing many of the state‚Äôs leading firms and industries, as well as the small business segment. Allan Zaremberg - President and CEO  History  The CalChamber traces its roots directly to the California State Board of Trade, which incorporated on February 20, 1890 after three years as a voluntary organization. The primary goal of the organization in those early years was to encourage immigration to California, a goal of the State Board of Trade pursued by publishing and circulating statistical and other descriptive information on the growth and products of the state. In an effort to more effectively promote the business of the state, the California State Board of Trade merged with the Manufacturers and Producers Association of California and the California Promotion Committee in 1910. The new combined group, known as the California Development Board, carried out the aims of its parent groups. The board continued to promote immigration to California, the main focus of the Board of Trade. It encouraged pride in California-made products, as had the Manufacturers and Producers Association. It also disseminated information about the state, as had the California Promotion Committee. To better deal with the complexities of supporting a sound business climate in a rapidly growing state, the California Development Board merged with the California Industries Association in 1921 to form the California Development Association, Commerce and Industry. In September 1929, the organization incorporated as the California State Chamber of Commerce, Agriculture and Industry. In 1972, the Board of Directors adopted the shorter name: California Chamber of Commerce.California: Triumph of the Entrepreneurial Spirit, 1989 Windsor Publications, Inc., page 240.

Early life and naval career Born in Melbourne, he was educated at Geelong Grammar School and then the Royal Australian Naval College. He served in the Royal Australian Navy from 1940 to 1968. He was a lieutenant aboard during the battles of Leyte and Lingayen Gulf. In the rank of Acting Captain, he was an honorary aide-de-camp to the Governor-General, and Director of Naval Intelligence 1961 from 1963, and after confirmation in the rank of Captain, he served as Captain of and Captain of the Australian Destroyer Squadron 1963‚Äì65. Then after serving as Director of Project Coordination in Navy Office, he resigned from the RAN in 1968. Political career In 1969, David was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Liberal member for Isaacs. Narrowly defeated by Labor candidate Gareth Clayton in 1974, he became a political columnist for The Age newspaper and undertook a Master of Arts at Monash University in Constitutional Law, studying the historical role of the Australian Senate. He was re-elected to Isaacs in 1975 but contested the Senate in 1977. He was successful, and remained a Liberal senator for Victoria until his retirement in 1990. A strong supporter of improving the function of the Senate as a house of review, he was Chairman of Committees as well as Deputy President of the Senate from 1983‚Äì1990. Hamer was also interested in promoting the arts in Australia, helping establish the Arts Council of Victoria, and serving as President of the Arts Council of Australia and of the Australian Film Institute. He was a keen supporter of the establishment of the National Film and Sound Archive as a way to collect and make accessible Australia's rich audiovisual history.

Desautels also reported as Addison was a United States Army corporal who was captured on December 1, 1950 at Sonchu by communist forces and not returned by North Korea at the end of the fighting of the Korean War. More than half a century later, the People's Republic of China admitted that Sgt. Desautels died while in captivity in China, and that his remains were buried in Shenyang, China. Early life Richard Desautels was from Shoreham, Vermont. After growing up on a farm, he joined the U.S. Army at age 17. Originally stationed in Fort Lewis (near Tacoma, Washington), he was transferred to South Korea in August 1950 shortly after North Korea invaded the South. Desautels had a brother, Rolland. Army service in Korea Desautels was assigned to A Company, 2nd Engineer Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division, when his unit was overrun by a Chinese assault near Kunu-ri, North Korea, on December 1, 1950. At the time, he had attained the rank of corporal. He was last seen alive at Camp 5 in Pyoktong, North Korea on August 7, 1953. Return of war dead controversy The Korean War Armistice Agreement was signed in 1953. One of the provisions of the agreement was for all sides to return the bodies of soldiers from the opposing side by October 30, 1954, namely to the Korean Communication Zone (KCOMZ). This exchange was carried out as Op Plan 14-54, also known as Operation Glory. The People's Republic of China had said no Americans were moved to Chinese territory from North Korea, however, authorities from the People's Republic of China gave Pentagon officials details about Desautels in a March 2003 meeting in Beijing contradicting their prior claim. This was not released until 2008 because the information was kept confidential and was only released to the family. There are reports that North Korea kept some American POWs after the war in retaliation for U.S. refusal to repatriate those American-held POWs who did not want to return. Gen. Mark W. Clark, former American commander of U.S. forces during the war wrote that \\"we had solid evidence\\" that hundreds of American POWs were kept after the war, possibly to gain leverage to replace the Republic of China with the People's Republic of China as the holder of the United Nations seat for China. Post-war POW Communist reports are that Desautels became mentally ill and died on April 29, 1953. He was buried in Shenyang, formerly known as Mukden. That area has been cited as where prison(s) holding hundreds of American POWs were kept, possibly as a transfer point to bring them to Russia. At least 19 reports from former POWs held with Desautels were made, stating that he was alive. Desautels spoke Chinese and had disputes with his Chinese captors. According to Chinese reports, he was buried but his body was reburied during a construction project and the location is not known. Promotion During his imprisonment, Desautels was promoted to the rank of sergeant.

In the mid-teens, R. F. Monroe was head of the Monroe Body Company in Pontiac, while William C. Durant headed Chevrolet in Flint. These two worked together to form Monroe Motor Company in Flint in August 1914. Monroe was president, while Durant was vice-president. There was a cross-stockholding arrangement between the Monroe and Chevrolet companies. Construction of the Monroe cars occurred in a plant formerly used by Chevrolet in Flint, and the Chevrolet company undertook to distribute the new Monroe automobile. However, in April 1916, Durant resigned his vice-presidency, and the Monroe company moved into the former Welch factory in Pontiac. The company was now reorganized as the Monroe Motor Car Company, with a capitalization increase to US$1,000,000. This company went bankrupt in 1918. In the fall of the same year, the William Small Company of Indianapolis bought the assets of the Monroe company. The Small company had previously distributed Monroes in Indianapolis. The Pontiac factory was now leased to General Motors for production of the Samson truck. Monroe production was thenceforth carried out in Indianapolis only. The showroom was located at 602 N. Capitol Street in Indianapolis and the building still stands today. The Monroe had started as a light, small car, with only open cars on offer. By this time in its history, however, they came equipped with an engine of the company's own design, and a sedan was included in the price lists by 1918. At this time, Louis Chevrolet was brought in by William Small as a consulting engineer to \\"work out design problems for the Monroe car.\\" This was ironic, as Louis Chevrolet had also used to work with William Durant, just as R. F. Monroe had. Chevrolet had little impact on the production Monroe car, but he did assemble seven race cars with Cornelius Van Ranst. Three of these were raced as Frontenacs, while the other four used the Monroe name. Louis Chevrolet's brother, Gaston, won the 1920 Indianapolis 500 in a Monroe. This was the first time an American car won at the Speedway since 1912. The Monroe team was the first to use radio communication to the driver in 1922. A car driven by Wilbur D'Alene with ride along mechanic Worth Schloeman was fitted with the radio equipment.Indianapolis Star May 3rd 1922 \\"Racing Car With Radio Outfit\\" Later the same summer, the William Small Company went into receivership. After various refinancings, the American Fletcher National Bank of Indianapolis purchased the Monroe assets in January 1922. In March of the next year, Strattan Motors Corporation bought the Monroe company. Frank E Strattan, the owner of Strattan Motors, was rumored to be also considering purchasing the Premier factory, also in Indianapolis. Strattan declared that the Monroe would continue to be built, but be joined by a lower-priced car called the Strattan. Just a few months later, in order to concentrate on his Strattan car, Frank Strattan sold the Monroe company to Frederick Barrows of Premier. Originally after this latest purchase, the company was organized as Monroe Motors, Inc., but soon it was absorbed by the Premier company. The last Monroes transformed into the Premier Model B.

Licensed to Tyler, Texas, United States, the station is currently owned by Paul Gleiser through licensee ATW Media, LLC. and currently features programming from ESPN Radio. TranslatorHistoryEarly Days of KGKB; move to Tyler= The facility was first proposed on March 27, 1928 by E.M., C.T., and E.E. Wilson, d.b.a. the Eagle Broadcasting Company. An application for a construction permit was filed to operate at 1070 kHz, with 50 watts of power, from a transmission site at Fisher & 5th Street in Goldthwaite, Texas. KGKB received its first License to Cover on May 22, 1928. The facility was again modified and requested an amendment of the license on December 6, 1928, moving the transmission site to Brownwood, and the broadcast studio location to Howard Payne College. An amendment was requested to move KGKB's operating channel to 1500 kHz on October 24, 1928, as well as to increase power to 100 watts. In January 1931, the Wilsons requested to move the facility a 2nd time; this time relocating to East Texas, and giving the region its first licensed aural service. A permit was granted for the move to Tyler on March 6, 1931, and officially signed on the air in Tyler on May 15, 1931, continuing to operate at 1500 kHz @ 100 watts unlimited hours, from the new transmission site at the Tyler Commercial College. This facility is considered the oldest continuously licensed operation in East Texas, preceding both KOCA in Kilgore (1936), and KFRO in Longview (1935). The KGKB license was transferred from Eagle Broadcasting Company to East Texas Broadcasting Company on January 29, 1932. On November 10, 1936, KGKB was authorized to increase daytime power to 250 watts, while nighttime operations remained at 100 watts. 3 years later, on October 3, 1939, KGKB gained authorization to use 250 watts unlimited hours. On February 13, 1940, the Commission revoked the license of KGKB, effective at 3:00 AM, March 1, 1940. East Texas Broadcasting Company immediately filed a request for a hearing with the Commission, which was granted on February 27, 1940. KGKB was allowed to continue operations during this period, and was Federally mandated to change the operating channel from 1500 kHz to the current 1490 kHz, using the same 250 watt power level, as a part of the NARBA reallocation. KGKB officially moved to 1490 on March 24, 1941. East Texas Broadcasting would ultimately be victorious in the license revocation hearing, resulting in the Commission vacating the Revocation Order on April 2, 1941, and fully licensing KGKB at its new operating channel of 1490 kHz, 250 watts unlimited. On October 9, 1944, East Texas Broadcasting would procure new stewardship as James G. & Minnie B. Ulmer acquired controlling interest in the corporation, through a purchase of stock from majority partner J.G. Kretsinger. The Voluntary license transfer for KGKB was granted by the Commission on May 22, 1945, and took effect on May 30. The Ulmers would own KGKB for just over 5 years, requesting a voluntary assignment of the license to Lucille Buford on October 18, 1950. The request was granted by the Commission 10 days later, with Buford Broadcasting assuming control of the license on October 28. Buford Broadcasting also owned and operated television station KLTV in Tyler, as the first channel to sign on in Tyler-Longview. Several changes to the 1490 facility accompanied the new ownership, including operating the transmission site remotely from a new studio location at Kilgore Highway and Farm to Market Road 1803, requested on June 1, 1954. The changes were approved on September 8, 1954, separating the transmission site and studio location for the first time since the move to Tyler 23 years earlier. Lucille Buford sold the KGKB license to Ron Litteral, d.b.a. Ron Litteral Enterprises, Inc. on June 6, 1957, in an effort to purchase another Tyler facility, 1330 KDOK. The license transfer was granted on July 1, 1957. Buford would go on to launch Tyler's first Top 40 format on 1330 KDOK, bringing Tyler into the new era of \\"Rock n' Roll\\" music, attracting a large audience, and topping the ratings in Tyler for the better part of the next few years. Litteral Enterprises would only briefly own KGKB, selling the facility to Oil Center Broadcasting Company on June 15, 1959. Oil Center Broadcasting would re-sell KGKB to O'Connor Broadcasting in October of the same year. On March 21, 1960, Harry O'Connor would request to move the control point and studios for KGKB from the Kilgore Highway location to 116 South Broadway in Tyler, which was granted on April 8. O'Connor's stewardship of KGKB would ultimately prove to be a literal dark period for the facility, with the Commission deferring the license renewal pending further consideration on July 25, 1962. This would lead the facility to go silent under temporary authorization for lengthy periods of time during the next 3 years. =1330 goes Country; Top 40 comes to 1490= On December 20, 1965, Wallace Barbee purchased controlling interest of KGKB stock from Harry O'Connor, requesting the newly available call set of KDOK which Buford Broadcasting had recently dropped on 1330 as a part of a format switch from Top 40 to Country music and obtaining a new call of KZAK. Barbee would bring 1490 back to life with the abandoned format and calls, moved the transmission site and studios to the famed NNE Loop 323 location, where the current tower still stands and operates, and increased the overall height of the single tower. The changes were completed and officially licensed by the FCC on June 28, 1966. In July 1967, a new Gates BC-1G transmitter was installed at the Loop 323 tower site, and the resistor was removed in the antenna system. Approval for the changes was granted on August 1, 1967. Ten years later, the transmitter was again changed to a Gates MW-1A in July 1977. On October 10, 1967, KDOK would be granted an increase in power to the current 1 kilowatt for daytime operations, while the night power remained at 250 watts. Barbee would transfer KDOK to Dana Adams in 1966, after a failed attempt of Buford Broadcasting to re-acquire the facility, which was dismissed by the Commission, under the continued licensee name of KDOK Broadcasting Company. It was sold by Mary Adams, executrix of the Dana Adams estate, to Copper Valley Broadcasters, Inc. in 1980 after the death of Dana Adams in 1973, and then transferred again to Golden Eagle Broadcasters, Inc in 1981. Golden Eagle would continue to program the Top 40 format, although adding in some elements of Adult Contemporary music, as AM radio music listening was beginning to wane in the early 1980s. During this period, they would install a Magnavox AM Stereo exciter into the MW-1A in 1983, giving 1490 its first stereo broadcast during its lifetime. This would later be switched to the Motorola C-QUAM unit by 1988. 1490 continued to broadcast in AM Stereo until 1993. KDOK would continue to program the famed Top 40 format in Tyler for nearly 25 years, facing various forms of competition from newcomers such as KTYL-FM and KPXI, as well as other AM Top 40s in the area such as KLUE in Longview. =KDOK throws in the towel; becomes Standards KYZS= On New Years Day 1990, the heritage KDOK Top 40/Contemporary Hit Radio format was finally dropped from 1490, reformatting with Big Band and Adult Standards music. The current KYZS call set was granted on February 1, 1990. =1490 drops music; becomes talk= The Standards format would continue on with meager success until 1993, when KYZS dropped music altogether, eliminating the C-QUAM AM stereo broadcast in the process, and has since remained a variation of spoken word format. Formats include talk radio and sports radio (both in English and Spanish). Paul Gleiser, d.b.a. Gleiser Broadcasting, L.P. purchased the facility on April 23, 1998.

Formula 1 work with Brabham Judd began his career at a young age, shortly after he decided to leave school. He managed to get signed as an employee for the engine company Coventry Climax, his first job. They gave him a scholarship to study at a local college. In the early 1960s he began working on the Coventry Climax Formula 1 engine, which was used at the time by Jack Brabham. After Brabham separated with Coventry to move to Repco, Judd was hired by Brabham to work with engine designer Phil Irving. He was to design and build the new 3-litre engines for Brabham, the result being two drivers championships and two constructors championships in 1966 and 1967. Later, Brabham switched again to Ford DFV engines built by Cosworth, and once again, Judd was hired by Jack Brabham to do developmental work on the Cosworth DFV engines. The Brabham team later sold to Bernie Ecclestone, and Jack Brabham planned to create a new project in engine development. He and Judd founded Engine Developments Ltd. in 1971. In the years that followed Engine Developments prepared Cosworth engines for teams such as Williams, Arrows, Lotus, Ensign and Fittipaldi. Independent company In the late 1970s, Judd and his team extended to IndyCar. In 1980, Judd was hired by Honda to develop an engine for the company's return to Formula Two in association with Ron Tauranac's Ralt team. Return to Formula 1 Judd and his company came back to F1 in the 1988 season supplying engines for Williams, Ligier and March. In 1991 Judd struck a deal with Scuderia Italia to supply V10 engines for a Dallara-designed car. In 1992 Judd created a partnership with Yamaha to build and develop engines for Formula 1. The best result of this collaboration came in the 1997 Hungarian GP when Damon Hill finished second behind Jacques Villeneuve. The partnership ended at the start of the 1998 season. Judd continued to develop his V10 engine in 1998 and 1999. Le Mans Beginning the 21st century, Judd and his company moved to touring cars and the Le Mans Series, resulting in victory in the 2001 American Le Mans Series with Dick Barbour Racing, and second place in the teams championship in the Rolex Sports Car Series in 2002 with Doran.

The novel is written as a series of journals chronicling the fictitious adventures of \\"J. Will Dodd's\\" ostensibly real ancestor in an imagined \\"Brides for Indians\\" program of the United States government. An introduction by \\"J. Will Dodd\\" places the journals in a contemporary context, and lends an air of realism. The book won the 1999 Fiction of the Year Award from the Mountains & Plains Booksellers Association. It has since sold over 250,000 copies in the United States, and its French translation was on the French bestseller list for 57 weeks and has sold over 400,000 copies in that country. Its sequel, published in 2017, is The Vengeance of Mothers. Plot The premise of the story is that the Northern Cheyenne Indians are shrinking in numbers and seek a way to assimilate into white society. They decide to marry white women and have half- blood children, enabling the two cultures to blend naturally. The Cheyenne Chief Little Wolf approaches President Ulysses Grant with the proposal to trade 1000 white women for 1000 horses, an offer publicly refused by the government. However, the government sees the placating of the Indians as being to their benefit, so they begin the \\"Brides for Indians\\" program in which women who are physically healthy and of child rearing age may volunteer to go. However, in order to keep the plan unpublished, they offer the trip to women in prison, asylums, and other restrictive situations. In Chicago, May Dodd was born into a wealthy family but she fell in love with a man who was \\"beneath\\" her, and bore his two children out of wedlock, so her family had her institutionalized in a mental asylum and had her children taken away. The \\"Brides for Indians\\" program sounded like a way out of the asylum, so she joined and started a life of adventure. The story does meet with some non- fictional characters and situations, including Chief Little Wolf of the Northern Cheyenne tribe, description of many Cheyenne beliefs, and the military forced move to the reservations. Some other situations are adapted from real life, including Little Wolf's murder of a tribe member and exile.

The website, which takes its name from the number of electors in the United States electoral college, was founded on March 7, 2008, as a polling aggregation website with a blog created by analyst Nate Silver. In August 2010, the blog became a licensed feature of The New York Times online and renamed FiveThirtyEight: Nate Silver's Political Calculus. In July 2013, ESPN acquired FiveThirtyEight, hiring Silver as editor-in-chief and a contributor for ESPN.com; the new publication launched on March 17, 2014. Since then, the FiveThirtyEight blog has covered a broad spectrum of subjects including politics, sports, science, economics and popular culture. In 2018, the operations were transferred from ESPN to sister property ABC News. During the presidential primaries and general election of 2008 the site compiled polling data through a unique methodology derived from Silver's experience in sabermetrics to \\"balance out the polls with comparative demographic data\\".Andrew Romano (June 16, 2008). \\"Making His Pitches: Nate Silver, an all- star in the world of baseball stats, may be the political arena's next big draw\\". Newsweek. Silver weighted \\"each poll based on the pollster's historical track record, sample size, and recentness of the poll\\". Since the 2008 election, the site has published articles‚Äîtypically creating or analyzing statistical information‚Äîon a wide variety of topics in current politics and political news. These included a monthly update on the prospects for turnover in the Senate; federal economic policies; Congressional support for legislation; public support for health care reform, global warming legislation and LGBT rights; elections around the world; marijuana legalization; and numerous other topics. The site and its founder are best known for election forecasts, including the 2012 presidential election in which FiveThirtyEight correctly predicted the vote winner of all 50 states. On the eve of the 2016 election, the site's forecast gave Hillary Clinton a 71% chance of winning and Donald Trump a 29% chance.\\"Who Will Win the Presidency\\". FiveThirtyEight. November 8, 2017. retrieved November 8, 2018. During its existence, FiveThirtyEight won numerous awards. These included Bloggie Awards for Best Political Coverage in 2008 and Best Weblog about Politics in 2009 as well as Webbies for Best Political Blog in 2012 and 2013. While under the ownership of ESPN in 2016, FiveThirtyEight won the Data Journalism Website of the Year award from the Paris, France-based Global Editors Network. The website's logo depicts a fox in reference to a phrase attributed to Archilochus: \\"The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing\\". The mascot has been named Fivey Fox. Genesis and history When Silver started FiveThirtyEight in early March 2008, he published under the name Poblano, the same name that he had used since November 2007 when he began publishing a diary on the political blog Daily Kos. Writing as Poblano on Daily Kos, he had gained a following, especially for his primary election forecast on Super Tuesday, February 5, 2008. From that primary election day, which included contests in 24 states plus American Samoa, Poblano predicted that Barack Obama would come away with 859 delegates, and Hillary Clinton 829; in the final contests, Obama won 847 delegates and Clinton 834. Based on this result, New York Times op-ed columnist William Kristol wrote: \\"And an interesting regression analysis at the Daily Kos Web site (poblano.dailykos.com) of the determinants of the Democratic vote so far, applied to the demographics of the Ohio electorate, suggests that Obama has a better chance than is generally realized in Ohio\\". FiveThirtyEight gained further national attention for beating out most pollsters' projections in the North Carolina and Indiana Democratic party primaries on May 6, 2008. As Mark Blumenthal wrote in National Journal, \\"Over the last week, an anonymous blogger who writes under the pseudonym Poblano did something bold on his blog, FiveThirtyEight.com. He posted predictions for the upcoming primaries based not on polling data, but on a statistical model driven mostly by demographic and past vote data.... Critics scoffed. Most of the public polls pointed to a close race in North Carolina.... But a funny thing happened. The model got it right.\\" Silver relied on demographic data and on the history of voting in other states during the 2008 Democratic primary elections. On May 30, 2008, Silver revealed his true identity for the first time to his FiveThirtyEight readers. After that date, he published just four more diaries on Daily Kos. As the primary season was coming to an end, Silver began to build a model for the general election race. This model, too, relied in part on demographic information but mainly involved a complex method of aggregating polling results. In 2008, Rasmussen Reports had an apparently short-term partnership with FiveThirtyEight in order to include this unique methodology for generating poll averages in their \\"Balance of Power Calculator\\". At the same time, FiveThirtyEight's daily \\"Today's Polls\\" column began to be mirrored on \\"The Plank,\\" a blog published by The New Republic. By early October 2008, FiveThirtyEight approached 2.5 million visitors per week, while averaging approximately 400,000 per weekday. During October 2008 the site received 3.63 million unique visitors, 20.57 million site visits, and 32.18 million page views. On Election Day, November 4, 2008, the site had nearly 5 million page views. On June 3, 2010, Silver announced that in early August the blog would be \\"relaunched under a NYTimes.com domain\\". The transition took place on August 25, 2010, with the publication of Silver's first FiveThirtyEight blog article online in The New York Times. In July 2013, it was revealed that Silver and his FiveThirtyEight blog would depart The New York Times and join ESPN. In its announcement of its acquisition of FiveThirtyEight, ESPN reported that \\"Silver will serve as the editor-in-chief of the site and will build a team of journalists, editors, analysts and contributors in the coming months. Much like Grantland, which ESPN launched in 2011, the site will retain an independent brand sensibility and editorial point-of-view, while interfacing with other websites in the ESPN and Disney families. The site will return to its original URL, www.FiveThirtyEight.com.\\" According to Silver, the focus of FiveThirtyEight in its ESPN phase would broaden: \\"People also think it's going to be a sports site with a little politics thrown in, or it's going to be a politics site with sports thrown in.... But we take our science and economics and lifestyle coverage very seriously.... It's a data journalism site. Politics is one topic that sometimes data journalism is good at covering. It's certainly good with presidential elections. But we don't really see politics as how the site is going to grow\\". FiveThirtyEight launched its ESPN webpage on March 17, 2014. The lead story by Silver explained that \\"FiveThirtyEight is a data journalism organization.... We've expanded our staff from two full-time journalists to 20 and counting. Few of them will focus on politics exclusively; instead, our coverage will span five major subject areas ‚Äì politics, economics, science, life and sports. Our team also has a broad set of skills and experience in methods that fall under the rubric of data journalism. These include statistical analysis, but also data visualization, computer programming and data-literate reporting. So in addition to written stories, we'll have interactive graphics and features\\". In April 2018, it was announced that FiveThirtyEight would be transferred to ABC News from ESPN, Inc., majority owned by The Walt Disney Company. ABC News Live streaming channel was launched on Roku in May 2019. With the reorganization creating the Walt Disney Direct- to-Consumer and International segment in March 2018, ABC News Digital and Live Streaming (websites, ABC News Live and FiveThirtyEight) was transferred to the new segment. 2008 U.S. electionsMethods= One unique aspect of the site is Silver's efforts to rank pollsters by accuracy, weight their polls accordingly, and then supplement those polls with his own electoral projections based on demographics and prior voting patterns. \\"I did think there was room for a more sophisticated way of handling these things,\\" Silver said. FiveThirtyEight weighs pollsters' historical track records through a complex methodology and assigns them values to indicate \\"Pollster-Introduced Error\\". At base Silver's method is similar to other analysts' approaches to taking advantage of the multiple polls that are conducted within each state: he averaged the polling results. But especially in the early months of the election season polling in many states is sparse and episodic. The \\"average\\" of polls over an extended period (perhaps several weeks) would not reveal the true state of voter preferences at the present time, nor provide an accurate forecast of the future. One approach to this problem was followed by Pollster.com: if enough polls were available, it computed a locally weighted moving average or LOESS. However, while adopting such an approach in his own analysis, Silver reasoned that there was additional information available in polls from \\"similar\\" states that might help to fill the gaps in information about the trends in a given state. Accordingly, he adapted an approach that he had previously used in his baseball forecasting: using nearest neighbor analysis he first identified \\"most similar states\\" and then factored into his electoral projections for a given state the polling information from \\"similar states\\". He carried this approach one step further by also factoring national polling trends into the estimates for a given state. Thus, his projections were not simply based on the polling trends in a given state. Furthermore, a basic intuition that Silver drew from his analysis of the 2008 Democratic party primary elections was that the voting history of a state or Congressional district provided clues to current voting. This is what allowed him to beat all the pollsters in his forecasts in the Democratic primaries in North Carolina and Indiana, for example. Using such information allowed Silver to come up with estimates of the vote preferences even in states for which there were few if any polls. For his general election projections for each state, in addition to relying on the available polls in a given state and \\"similar states,\\" Silver estimated a \\"538 regression\\" using historical voting information along with demographic characteristics of the states to create an estimate that he treated as a separate poll (equivalent to the actually available polls from that state). This approach helped to stabilize his projections, because if there were few if any polls in a given state, the state forecast was largely determined by the 538 regression estimate. In July 2008, the site began to report regular updates of projections of 2008 U.S. Senate races. Special procedures were developed relying on both polls and demographic analysis. The projections were updated on a weekly basis. =Final projections of 2008 elections= In the final update of his presidential forecast model at midday of November 4, 2008, Silver projected a popular vote victory by 6.1 percentage points for Barack Obama and electoral vote totals of 349 (based on a probabilistic projection) or 353 (based on fixed projections of each state). Obama won with 365 electoral college votes. Silver's predictions matched the actual results everywhere except in Indiana and the 2nd congressional district of Nebraska, which awards an electoral vote separately from the rest of the state. His projected national popular vote differential was below the actual figure of 7.2 points. The forecasts for the Senate proved to be correct for every race. But the near stalemate in Minnesota led to a recount that was settled only on June 30, 2009. In Alaska, after a protracted counting of ballots, on November 19 Republican incumbent Ted Stevens conceded the seat to Democrat Mark Begich, an outcome that Silver had forecast on election day. And in Georgia, a run-off election on December 2 led to the re-election of Republican Saxby Chambliss, a result that was also consistent with Silver's original projection. After the 2008 U.S. electionFocus= During the first two months after the election, no major innovations in content were introduced. A substantial percentage of the articles focused on Senatorial races: the runoff in Georgia, won by Saxby Chambliss; recounts of votes in Alaska (won by Mark Begich), and Minnesota (Al Franken vs. Norm Coleman); and the appointments of Senatorial replacements in Colorado, New York, and Illinois. After President Obama's inauguration, Sean Quinn reported that he was moving to Washington, D.C., to continue political writing from that locale. On February 4, 2009, he became the first blogger to join the White House press corps. After that time, however, he contributed only a handful of articles to FiveThirtyEight. During the post-2008 election period Silver devoted attention to developing some tools for the analysis of forthcoming 2010 Congressional elections, as well as discussing policy issues and the policy agenda for the Obama administration, especially economic policies. He developed a list of 2010 Senate races in which he made monthly updates of predicted party turnover. Later, Silver adapted his methods to address a variety of issues of the day, including health care reform, climate change, unemployment, and popular support for same-sex marriage. He wrote a series of columns investigating the credibility of polls by Georgia-based firm Strategic Vision, LLC. According to Silver's analysis, Strategic Vision's data displayed statistical anomalies that were inconsistent with random polling. Later, he uncovered indirect evidence that Strategic Vision may have gone as far as to fabricate the results of a citizenship survey taken by Oklahoma high school students, which led him to denounce Strategic Vision as \\"disreputable and fraudulent.\\" FiveThirtyEight devoted more than a dozen articles to the Iranian presidential election in June 2009, assessing of the quality of the vote counting. International affairs columnist Renard Sexton began the series with an analysis of polling leading up to the election; then posts by Silver, Andrew Gelman and Sexton analyzed the reported returns and political implications. FiveThirtyEight covered the November 3, 2009, elections in the United States in detail. FiveThirtyEight writers Schaller, Gelman, and Silver also gave extensive coverage to the January 19, 2010 Massachusetts special election to the U.S. Senate. The \\"538 model\\" once again aggregated the disparate polls to correctly predict that the Republican Scott Brown would win. In spring of 2010, FiveThirtyEight turned a focus on the United Kingdom general election scheduled for May 6, with a series of more than forty articles on the subject that culminated in projections of the number of seats that the three major parties were expected to win. Following a number of preview posts in January and February, Renard Sexton examined subjects such as the UK polling industry and the 'surge' of the third-party Liberal Democrats, while Silver, Sexton and Dan Berman developed a seat projection model. The UK election was the first time the FiveThirtyEight team did an election night 'liveblog' of a non-U.S. election. In April 2010, the Guardian Newspaper published Silver's predictions for the 2010 United Kingdom General Election. The majority of polling organisations in the UK use the concept of uniform swing to predict the outcome of elections. However, by applying his own methodology, Silver produced very different results, which suggested that a Conservative victory might have been the most likely outcome. After a series of articles, including critiques and responses to other electoral analysts, his \\"final projection\\" was published on the eve of the election. In the end, Silver's projections were off the mark, particularly compared with those of some other organizations, and Silver wrote a post mortem on his blog. Silver examined the pitfalls of the forecasting process, while Sexton discussed the final government agreement between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. =Controversy over transparency in pollster ratings= On June 6, 2010, FiveThirtyEight posted pollster rankings that updated and elaborated Silver's efforts from the 2008 election. Silver expanded the database to more than 4,700 election polls and developed a model for rating the polls that was more sophisticated than his original rankings. Silver responded on 538: \\"Where's the transparency? Well, it's here [citing his June 6 article], in an article that contains 4,807 words and 18 footnotes. Every detail of how the pollster ratings are calculated is explained. It's also here [referring to another article], in the form of Pollster Scorecards, a feature which we'll continue to roll out over the coming weeks for each of the major polling firms, and which will explain in some detail how we arrive at the particular rating that we did for each one\\". As for why the complete 538 polling database had not been released publicly, Silver responded: \\"The principal reason is because I don't know that I'm legally entitled to do so. The polling database was compiled from approximately eight or ten distinct data sources, which were disclosed in a comment which I posted shortly after the pollster ratings were released, and which are detailed again at the end of this article. These include some subscription services, and others from websites that are direct competitors of this one. Although polls contained in these databases are ultimately a matter of the public record and clearly we feel as though we have every right to use them for research purposes, I don't know what rights we might have to re-publish their data in full\\". Silver also commented on the fact that the 538 ratings had contributed to Markos Moulitsas's decision to end Daily Kos's use of Research 2000 as its pollster. Subsequently, on June 11, Mark Blumenthal also commented on the question of transparency in an article in the National Journal titled \\"Transparency In Rating: Nate Silver's Impressive Ranking Of Pollsters' Accuracy Is Less Impressive In Making Clear What Data Is Used\\". He noted that in the case of Research 2000 there were some discrepancies between what Silver reported and what the pollster itself reported. Other researchers questioned aspects of the methodology. On June 16, 2010, Silver announced on his blog that he is willing to give all pollsters who he had included in his rating a list of their polls that he had in his archive, along with the key information that he used (poll marginals, sample size, dates of administration); and he encouraged the pollsters to examine the lists and the results to compare them with the pollster's own record and make corrections. In September 2014, Silver put into the public domain all of his pollster ratings, as well as descriptive summary data for all of the more than 6,600 polls in his data collection for the final three weeks of U.S. Presidential primaries and general elections, state governor elections, and U.S. Senate and U.S. Congress elections for the years 1998‚Äì2012. In addition to updating his pollster ratings, he published an updated methodological report. Partnership with The New York Times: 2010‚Äì2013 On June 3, 2010, The New York Times and Silver announced that FiveThirtyEight had formed a partnership under which the blog would be hosted by the Times for a period of three years. In legal terms, FiveThirtyEight granted a \\"license\\" to the Times to publish the blog. The blog would be listed under the \\"Politics\\" tab of the News section of the Times. FiveThirtyEight would thus be subject to and benefit from editing and technical production by the Times, while FiveThirtyEight would be responsible for creating the content. Silver received bids from several major media entities before selecting the Times. Under terms of the agreement, Silver would also write monthly articles for the print version of both the newspaper and the Sunday magazine. Silver did not move his blog to the highest bidder, because he was concerned with maintaining his own voice while gaining the exposure and technical support that a larger media company could provide. \\"There's a bit of a Groucho Marx quality to it [Silver has said].... You shouldn't want to belong to any media brand that seems desperate to have you as a member, even though they'll probably offer the most cash\\". The first column of the renamed FiveThirtyEight: Nate Silver's Political Calculus appeared in The Times on August 25, 2010, with the introduction of U.S. Senate election forecasts. At the same time, Silver published a brief history of the blog. All columns from the original FiveThirtyEight were also archived for public access. Shortly after FiveThirtyEight relocated to The New York Times, Silver introduced his prediction models for the 2010 elections to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and state Governorships. Each of these models relied initially on a combination of electoral history, demographics, and polling. The 538 model had forecast a net pickup of 8 seats by the Republicans in the Senate and 55 seats in the House, close to the actual outcome of a pickup of 6 seats in the Senate and 63 seats in the House. =Writers= When the transition to The New York Times was announced, Silver listed his staff of writers for the first time. However, of the seven listed writers, only three of them had published on 538/New York Times by late December 2010: Silver, Renard Sexton and Hale Stewart. Andrew Gelman contributed again in early 2011. Brian McCabe published his first article in January 2011. Beginning in 2011, one writer who emerged as a regular contributor was Micah Cohen. Cohen provided a periodic \\"Reads and Reactions\\" column in which he summarized Silver's articles for the previous couple of weeks, as well as reactions to them in the media and other blogs, and suggested some additional readings related to the subject of Silver's columns. Silver identified Cohen as \\"my news assistant\\". Cohen also contributed additional columns on occasion. On September 12, 2011, Silver introduced another writer: \\"FiveThirtyEight extends a hearty welcome to John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, who will be writing a series of posts for this site over the next month. Mr. Sides is also the founder of the blog The Monkey Cage, which was named the 2010 Blog of the Year by The Week magazine\\". =Beyond electoral politics= While politics and elections remained the main focus of FiveThirtyEight, the blog also sometimes addressed sports, including the March Madness and the 2012 NCAA Men's Basketball tournament selection process, the B.C.S. rankings in NCAA college football, the NBA, and Major League Baseball matters ranging from the 2011 attendance at the New York Mets' Citi Field to the historic 2011 collapse of the Boston Red Sox. In addition, FiveThirtyEight sometimes turned its attention to other topics, such as the economics of blogging, the financial ratings by Standard & Poors, economists' tendency to underpredict unemployment levels, and the economic impact and media coverage of Hurricane Irene (2011). Adapted from a FiveThirtyEight October 2011 graph published in the New York Times. FiveThirtyEight published a graph showing different growth curves of the news stories covering Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street protests. Silver pointed out that conflicts with the police caused the sharpest increases in news coverage of the protests and assessed the geography of the protests by analyzing news reports of the size and location of events across the United States. =2012 U.S. elections= FiveThirtyEight rolled out the first iteration of its 2012 general election forecasting model on June 7, 2012. The model forecasts both the popular vote and the electoral college vote, with the latter being central to the exercise and involving a forecast of the electoral outcome in each state. In the initial forecast, Barack Obama was estimated to have a 61.8% chance of winning the electoral vote in November 2012. The website provided maps and statistics about the electoral outcomes in each state as well as nationally. Later posts addressed methodological issues such as the \\"house effects\\" of different pollsters as well as the validity of telephone surveys that did not call cell phones. From the middle of 2012 until election day, the FiveThirtyEight model updated its estimates of the probability that Barack Obama and Mitt Romney would win a majority of the electoral votes. On election day, November 6, Silver posted his final forecast for each state. On the morning of the November 6, 2012 presidential election, Silver's model gave President Barack Obama a 90.9% chance of winning a majority of the electoral votes. At the end of that day, after the ballots had been counted, the 538 model had correctly predicted the winner of all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Silver, along with at least two academic- based analysts who aggregated polls from multiple pollsters, thus got not only all 50 state predictions right, but also all 9 of the \\"swing states\\". In contrast, individual pollsters were less successful. For example, Rasmussen Reports \\"missed on six of its nine swing-state polls\\". An independent analysis of Silver's state-by-state projections, assessing whether the percentages of votes that the candidates actually received fell within the \\"margin of error\\" of Silver's forecasts, found that \\"48 out of 50 states actually fell within his margin of error, giving him a success rate of 96%. And assuming that his projected margin of error figures represent 95 percent confidence intervals, which it is likely they did, Silver performed just about exactly as well as he would expect to over 50 trials. Wizard, indeed\\". Additional tests of the accuracy of the electoral vote predictions were published by other researchers. ESPN affiliation FiveThirtyEight launched its ESPN-affiliated stage on March 17, 2014. As of July, it had a staff of 20 writers, editors, data visualization specialists, and others. By March 2016, this staff had nearly doubled to 37 listed on the masthead, and 7 listed as contributors. The site produced articles under 5 headings: politics, economics, science and health, (cultural) life, and sports. In addition to feature articles it produced podcasts on a range of subjects. Monthly traffic to the site grew steadily from about 2.8 million unique visitors in April 2014 to 10.7 million unique visitors in January 2016.Tweet by @NateSilver538 on February 3, 2016, https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/694974558831525888/photo/1 =2014 U.S. elections= On September 3, 2014, FiveThirtyEight introduced its forecasts for each of the 36 U.S. Senate elections being contested that year. At that time, the Republican Party was given a 64 percent chance of holding a majority of the seats in the Senate after the election. However, Silver also remarked, \\"An equally important theme is the high degree of uncertainty around that outcome. A large number of states remain competitive, and Democrats could easily retain the Senate\\". About two weeks later, the forecast showed the Republican chances of holding the majority down to 55 percent. =2016 Oscars predictions= FiveThirtyEight sought to apply its mathematical models to the Oscars, and produced internal predictions regarding the subject, predicting four out of six categories correctly. The website also compiled a list of other predictions made by other people using different methods. =2016 U.S. elections= Presidential primary elections FiveThirtyEight applied two separate models to forecast the 2016 Presidential Primary elections ‚Äì polls-only and polls-plus models. The polls-only model relied only on polls from a particular state, while the polls-plus model was based on state polls, national polls and endorsements. For each contest, FiveThirtyEight produced probability distributions and average expected vote shares according to both models. As early as June 2015, FiveThirtyEight argued that Donald Trump \\"isn't a real candidate\\" and, until late in the election season, maintained that Trump could not win the nomination. When Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee in May 2016, New York Times media columnist Jim Rutenberg wrote that \\"predictions can have consequences\\" and criticized FiveThirtyEight for underestimating Trump's chances. He argued that by giving \\"Mr. Trump a 2 percent chance at the nomination despite strong polls in his favor ... they also arguably sapped the journalistic will to scour his record as aggressively as those of his supposedly more serious rivals\\". In a long retrospective, \\"How I Acted Like a Pundit and Screwed up on Donald Trump,\\" published in May 2016 after Trump had become the likely nominee, Silver reviewed how he had erred in evaluating Trump's chances early in the primary campaign. Silver wrote, \\"The big mistake is a curious one for a website that focuses on statistics. Unlike virtually every other forecast we publish at FiveThirtyEight ‚Äì including the primary and caucus projections I just mentioned ‚Äì our early estimates of Trump's chances weren't based on a statistical model. Instead, they were what we [call] 'subjective odds' ‚Äì which is to say, educated guesses. In other words, we were basically acting like pundits, but attaching numbers to our estimates. And we succumbed to some of the same biases that pundits often suffer, such as not changing our minds quickly enough in the face of new evidence. Without a model as a fortification, we found ourselves rambling around the countryside like all the other pundit-barbarians, randomly setting fire to things\\".Nate Silver, \\"How I Acted Like a Pundit and Screwed up on Donald Trump: Trump's Nomination Shows the Need for a More Rigorous Approach,\\" FiveThirtyEight, May 18, 2016. On the Democratic side, FiveThirtyEight argued that Senator Bernie Sanders could \\"lose everywhere else after Iowa and New Hampshire\\" and that the \\"Democratic establishment would rush in to squash\\" him if he does not. Sanders went on to win 23 states in the primaries. Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, a progressive nonprofit media watch group, wrote in May 2016 that FiveThirtyEight \\"sacrificed its integrity to go after Sanders\\" and that they have \\"at times gone beyond the realm of punditry into the realm of hackery ‚Äì that is, not just treating their own opinions as though they were objective data, but spinning the data so that it conforms to their opinions.\\" FiveThirtyEights predictions for each state primary, both for the Republican and the Democratic party nominations, were based on statistical analysis, not on the analyst's opinions. The core data employed were polls, which FiveThirtyEight aggregated for each state (while also considering national polls) using essentially the same method it had employed since 2008. In the 2016 primaries, the projections also took into account endorsements.Nate Silver, \\"How We're Forecasting the Primaries,\\" FiveThirtyEight, January 12, 2016 The website also kept track of the accumulation of national party convention delegates.Aaron Bycoffe and David Wasserman, \\"Who's On Track for the Nomination?\\" FiveThirtyEight, June 15, 2016 In a comparison of prediction success published by Bloomberg News after the primary season was completed, FiveThirtyEight's prediction success tied for the highest percentage of correct primary poll winners, at 92%; but it lagged behind PredictWise in predicting a larger set of primaries.Andre Tartar, \\"Ranking the 2016 Presidential Primary Polls and Predictions ,\\" Bloomberg News, June 29, 2016 Notably, even with FiveThirtyEight's track record of correctly predicting elections that pollsters get wrong, it still missed Bernie Sanders's upset victory in the Michigan primary, for instance, regarded as the 'one of the biggest upsets in modern political history'. Presidential general election The final prediction by FiveThirtyEight on the morning of election day (November 8, 2016) was at 10:41 a.m. and had Hillary Clinton with a 71% chance to win the 2016 United States presidential election, while other major forecasters had predicted Clinton to win with at least an 85% to 99% probability. FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in final weeks based on both Clinton's small lead in general polls, but also on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania, mixed with Clinton's poor performing in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012. The main issues pointed out by the forecast model was the imbalance of Clinton's improvement in very populated states like Texas, Georgia (projected safe for Republican) and California (projected safe for Democrats); mixed with her inability to attract white voters without a college degree, an increasing demographic in swing states, in addition to a potential decline in turnout from minorities. In consequence, Clinton's probabilities to win the Electoral College were not improving. Silver also focused on state-by- state numbers in so-called 'must-win' states like Ohio and Florida, plus a consideration of polls' margin of error in advantages of less than three points. Donald Trump won the election. FiveThirtyEight projected a much higher probability of Donald Trump winning the presidency than other pollsters,Why FiveThirtyEight Gave Trump a Better Chance Than Almost Anyone Else ; FiveThirtyEight; Nate Silver; November 11, 2016 a projection which was criticized by Ryan Grim of the Huffington Post as \\"unskewing\\" too much in favor of Trump.Nate Silver Is Unskewing Polls ‚Äî All Of Them ‚Äî In Trump's Direction ; Huffington Post; Ryan Grim; November 5, 2016 While FiveThirtyEight expressed that \\"nonetheless, Clinton is probably going to win, and she could win by a big margin\\", the forecaster also made a point about the uncertainty of poll trackers in some cases, about a considerable number of undecided voters and about the unpredictable outcome in traditional swing states.

She was a subject of the book Abby Smith and Her Cows in which her sister Julia Evelina Smith told the story of a tax resistance struggle they undertook in the suffrage cause.  Family background  Born in 1797, Smith was the youngest of five daughters of Hannah Hadassah (Hickock) Smith and Zephaniah Hollister Smith, a Nonconformist clergyman turned farmer. Smith's mother authored one of the earliest anti-slavery petitions, presented to the United States Congress by John Quincy Adams. The family was united in support of her advocacy of education, abolition and women's rights. At Hannah's instigation, the family house on Main Street, Kimberly Mansion, was a stop on the Connecticut Freedom Trail; it is now a designated National Historic Landmark. The Smiths of Glastonbury‚Äînamely, Smith, her sisters, and her mother‚Äîwere inducted wholesale into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame in 1994. Suffrage-related activism Smith was educated at Emma Willard‚Äôs Seminary in Troy, New York and was known to have kept a diary in both French and Latin. In 1869, Smith and her sister, Julia, attended a woman‚Äôs suffrage meeting in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1872, the town of Glastonbury attempted to raise taxes on the Smith sisters and two other widows in town. None of their male neighbors‚Äô taxes had risen, so the sisters refused to pay the taxes without having been granted a right to vote in town meetings. The sister‚Äôs plight was soon published in the Springfield, Massachusetts newspaper, The Republican, and newspapers across the country quickly picked up on the story. In 1873, Smith traveled to New York City to attend the first meeting of the Association for the Advancement of Women, and a month later she protested taxation of disenfranchised women. In January 1874, seven of her cows were seized and sold for taxes. When she protested this seizure of property, 15 acres of pastureland was also seized, illegally, for delinquent taxes.McCain, Diana Ross. It Happened in Connecticut. Globe Pequot, 2008, pp. 93-98.

Early life McNeill was born on 12 August 1795 at Oronsay House on the island of Oronsay in the Inner Hebrides. He was the third of the six sons of John McNeill, laird of Colonsay and Oronsay (1767‚Äì1846) and his wife, Hester McNeill (died 1843). He was the younger brother of the law lord Duncan McNeill, 1st Baron Colonsay and Oronsay. Education He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated as a Doctor of Medicine in 1814, at the age of nineteen. CareerIndia= On 6 September 1816 he was appointed assistant surgeon on the Honourable East India Company's Bombay establishment. He was moved to Persia in 1819. He received his licence as a surgeon on 1 May 1824 and retired from the medical service on 4 June 1836, thereafter concentrating on the diplomatic aspects of the East India Company. He was attached to the field force under Colonel East in Kutch and Okamundel in 1818‚Äì19 and was afterwards deputy medical storekeeper at the presidency. =Persia= From 1824 to 1835, he was attached to the East India Company's legation in Persia, at first in medical charge, and latterly as political assistant to the Minister, John Macdonald Kinneir, in which post he displayed great ability. For instance, in 1829 he was probably one of the instigators of the murder of Alexander Griboyedov by Persian mob in Teheran. On 30 June 1835, he was appointed secretary of the special embassy sent to Tehran under Henry Ellis to congratulate Mohammad Shah Qajar on his accession to the Persian throne. McNeill received permission to wear the Persian Order of the Lion and the Sun of the first class, and on his return home in the spring of 1836, he anonymously published a startling anti-Russian pamphlet, Progress and Present Position of Russia in the East. From 1836 to 1844, McNeill was any envoy to Persia. See Siege of Herat. =Scotland= In 1845, McNeill was appointed chairman of the Board of Supervision, entrusted with the working of the new Poor Law (Scotland) Act 1845, a post he occupied for twenty-three years. During the Highland Potato Famine ‚Äì nearly as disastrous as the Great Famine of Ireland ‚Äì he conducted a special inquiry into the condition of the western Scottish Highlands and Western Isles, during which he personally inspected twenty-seven of the most distressed parishes. During his stay in Scotland he lived at Granton House in Edinburgh.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1850-1 He was cofounder in 1851, with Sir Charles Trevelyan, of the Highland and Island Emigration Society which during the Highland Clearances supported an exodus of nearly 5,000 people to Australia between 1851 and 1856. Devine, T. M. To the Ends of the Earth: Scotland's Global Diaspora, Allen Lane, 1 August 2011, Chapter 5, Section 2. =Crimean War= At the outbreak the Crimean War in 1854, McNeill published revised editions in French and English of his pamphlet Progress and Present Position of Russia in the East, with supplementary chapters dealing with the progress of events since 1836, and insisting on the importance to Britain and to Christendom of the autonomy of Turkey and Persia. At the beginning of 1855, when the Crimean disasters had roused public indignation, McNeill and Colonel Alexander Tulloch, an officer of great administrative experience at the War Office, were sent to the Crimea with instructions to report on the whole arrangements and management of the commissariat and the method of keeping accounts, and to the causes of the delays in unloading and distributing clothing and other stores sent to Balaklava. The commissioners started at once for the seat of war. They took no shorthand writer with them, as the remuneration sanctioned by the Treasury was insufficient to secure a qualified person. The McNeill‚ÄìTulloch inquiry was the most effective of the various inquisitions into the Crimean d√©b√¢cle. It sharply criticised Lord Raglan's personal staff in the Crimea and Commissary- General Filder, and it led to many recriminations as officers sought to clear their names when the report was published in 1856. A board of general officers was convened to clear the army, but despite its protestations, the McNeill‚ÄìTulloch report led to professional reform of the commissariat by the Royal Warrant of October 1858. Very unusually, the Commons, irritated by executive obfuscation, passed a resolution in 1857 calling for special honours and McNeill soon became a Privy Councillor and Tulloch was appointed a KCB. The University of Oxford made McNeill a Doctor of Civil Law and the University of Edinburgh chose him as chairman of its amalgamated societies; his inaugural address on competitive examinations was published in 1861. Personal life Liberton Cemetery, Edinburgh McNeill married, firstly, in 1814, Innes Robinson, fourth daughter of George Robinson of Clermiston, Midlothian ‚Äì she died in 1816; secondly, in 1823, Eliza Wilson, third daughter of John Wilson ‚Äì she died in 1868; thirdly, in 1871, Lady Emma Augusta Campbell, daughter of John Campbell, 7th Duke of Argyll. McNeill was the brother-in law (by his 2nd marriage) of the author John Wilson, and (by his 3rd marriage) of George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll. McNeill died at Poralto near Cannes in France, on 17 May 1883. A memorial to his memory lies on the south-east wall of Liberton Cemetery in Edinburgh, at the grave of his third wife, Emma Augusta.

It is the finest example of a complete monastic complex surviving in Denmark, and one of the best in all of Scandinavia.  History  Carmelites = The Priory of Our Lady was established in 1430 for a group of Carmelite friars from Landskrona. It was one of three religious houses founded in Helsing√∏r by King Erik VII as it grew from a small fishing village to a trading port on √òresund, the strait which separates Zealand from Sk√•ne, an important fishing ground and busy shipping corridor between the North Sea and the Baltic. Erik VII, the heir of Margaret I, needed funds and his new toll on shipping was a source of steady income. He wanted to impress outsiders and set about purposefully to develop Helsing√∏r as a gateway city. One of the things he did was to establish in the town not only the priory for the Carmelites but also a Franciscan friary and a Dominican priory. The Carmelites were a mendicant order () which means that at least in the beginning they depended on the generosity of local residents for their sustenance. They were sometimes called the \\"little white friars\\". King Erik invited them into Denmark and established the priory of Our Lady in Helsing√∏r to ensure that they remained. As time passed the priory received many properties scattered all over Zealand which decreased their dependence on others. The priory in Helsing√∏r eventually became the headquarters for the Carmelites in Scandinavia. Its property was a gift from King Erik, and included several farms for its maintenance. The buildings were of red brick, the most common building material of the day in the region. The three main buildings were built around a central garden and cloister, with the church of St. Mary forming the fourth side to the south. The church was built as a three-aisled basilica, but the central nave was built significantly higher than the others in the Gothic style. The oldest buildings were destroyed by a fire in 1450, resulting in its current appearance which dates to 1500, when the building of the church was completed. In 1516 a hospital was created here for foreign sailors. The most influential Carmelite from the priory in Helsing√∏r was Poul Helgesen, who was a university lecturer and student of Erasmus. He was an early proponent of Lutheran reforms in Denmark, but later became disenchanted with Lutheranism as well, earning him the hatred of both religious communities. He wrote a chronicle of his turbulent time, but it was never published. A manuscript was discovered inside the walls of Skibby church, later published under the title Skibby Chronicle. = Dissolution and after = After the dissolution of the priory in 1536 during the Reformation, the Carmelites were turned out, and the premises were abandoned until 1541 when Christian III re-endowed it as the hospital of Helsing√∏r (Vor Frue Hospital or Almindeligt Hospital), with enough income-producing properties to sustain it. It was continued in intermittent use as a hospital for the sick, the elderly, and the poor until 1916, when new premises were made available elsewhere. Also in 1541 a grammar school was established in the west wing, which continued until 1807. From 1930 a small number of single women lived in the buildings as an almshouse, the last of whom left in 1986. In 1989 the local church and episcopal authorities took over the buildings and still occupy part of them. In 1992 restoration work was carried out on the frescoes in the former conventual buildings. File:Karmeliterklostret Helsingoer.jpgConventual range File:Sankt Mariae Helsingoer- Klostergangen.jpgCloister File:Sankt Mariae Helsingoer- Klosterg√•rden.jpgCloister garth = St. Mary's Church = The first intention after the dissolution of the priory was to demolish the church, but it found use as a warehouse and as stabling for horses, which preserved it until 1577, when it was made available to the foreign community residing in Helsing√∏r, mostly Germans from the cities of the Hanseatic League. It remained the \\"German\\" church until 1851, although from 1740 it was also the church for the garrison at Kronborg Castle. It became Helsing√∏r's second parish church in 1819 when St. Olai's parish split into two, although sermons in German were delivered here, between Danish services, until 1851. A large number of German inscriptions remain to testify to the church's Hanseatic past. Between 1900 and 1907 the church and the conventual buildings were totally restored under Professor H.B. Storck, with particular attention to the restoration and conservation of the impressive frescoes on the walls and ceilings. St. Mary's is home to a magnificent Baroque organ built in 1634-1636 by Johan Lorentz. One of the organists was the famed composer Dietrich Buxtehude.

Glass (September 24, 1911 - August 27, 2003) was an American designer, architect, author, and inventor. Biography Registry card of Henry P. Glass as a prisoner at Dachau Nazi Concentration Camp Born on 24 September 1911 in Vienna, Glass was trained as an architect at the Technical University of Vienna from 1929 to 1936. He married Eleanore Christine Knopp in March, 1937. Glass found early success designing interiors and furnishings for Vienna's bohemian elite until the Anschluss. He was denounced, sent to Dachau, then transferred to Buchenwald, where captors discovered his talents and forced him to design a cemetery for Nazi officers. He was finally released in 1939 through the intervention of his wife at the Gestapo in Berlin. Later during World War II, he assisted the US military by drawing a plan of the camp from memory. He immigrated to New York City in 1939, worked for Russel Wright and for Gilbert Rohde on the Anthracite Pavilion at the 1939 World's Fair. Glass moved to Chicago in 1942, where he worked as a designer of office furniture for the war effort and studied under L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy and Gy√∂rgy Kepes at the IIT Institute of Design. He soon established a career as a furniture and product designer, and opened his own design firm, Henry P. Glass Associates at the Furniture Mart in 1946. A William J. Brenner sofa designed by Glass was used on the living room set of the I Love Lucy show during the 1952-53 season. Henry was a great admirer of R. Buckminster Fuller and he made a deposit on Fuller's Dymaxion House, a prefabricated structure that could be assembled at any site. When none but two prototypes of this house were built, Henry decided to become the architect of his own passive solar home which was one of the first of its kind in America. The Henry P. Glass House was built in 1948 and it still stands on its original site in Northfield, Illinois. In addition to running his own industrial design business, Glass convinced the School of the Art Institute of Chicago to create an industrial design department in 1946 where he served as a professor for more than twenty years. The Henry P. Glass collection in the Ryerson & Burnham Library Archives contains the original manuscript for Glass's book Design and the Consumer, his teaching lecture notes, product advertisements, brochures, and photographs.

Glass House (1948) is arguably the first passive solar house in America and has been continuously occupied for over 60 years. Previous passive solar houses were either experimental or did not possess all the essential features of a solar home. In the Chicago area, George Fred Keck had included some of these passive solar design features (roof overhang, N-S ventilation, masonry floor) in the Spence House in 1941. Innovative new designs incorporating passive solar elements were built by Frank Lloyd Wright, F.W. Hutchinson and others but they lacked one or more features incorporated in Henry's design. It is important to differentiate these passive solar designs from the Active Design work carried on at M.I.T. which required fans or pumps to transfer the heat from the collectors to storage areas. Passive solar features of the Henry P. Glass House include: *South facing structure maximizes heat from winter sun *Large glass solar collection windows on south side *Thermopane glass used in windows reduces heat loss *Blinds over thermopane windows further reduce nighttime heat loss in winter *Angled roof provides maximum sunlight in winter *North-South cross ventilation in summer *Roof overhang shades interior of house in summer *Deciduous trees on south side provide shade in summer, allow light through in winter *Berm on south side blocks winter wind *Small windows on north side reduce heat loss in winter *Concrete slab floor acts as a heatsink to absorb thermal energy in day, release at night *Black finish on concrete floor improves thermal transfer Folding Chair, Designed 1961 Brooklyn Museum His industrial designs include: * Inflatable Chairs (1941) * Hairpin Leg Furniture (1942) * Saran Weave Folding Lawn Recliner (1953) * Swingline Children's Furniture (1954) * Kenmar/Glass Omega Lounger (1957) * Cylindra Furniture (1966) concept developed in 1942 * Cricket Chair (1978) Folding Picnic Table Model, Designed 1961 Brooklyn Museum =Prerequisites of Good Design Applied to Man-made Objects= From his book \\"The Shape of Manmade Things\\" There are seven qualifications which should be present in an article to deserve this label.

Biography  Dr√ÆmbƒÉ with Ileana Gyulai Dr√ÆmbƒÉ was born in 1942 in Timi»ôoara, in a working-class family. His father worked at the post office. He took up fencing aged 8 at the local club \\"FlacƒÉra ro»ôie\\" following his elder brother and quickly showed talent: he competed with seniors from the age of 13 both in foil and sabre and joined the national foil team at age 16. In 1959, he won the junior national championships in both weapons. Dr√ÆmbƒÉ transferred to CSA Steaua Bucure»ôti in 1960, when he was 18. He did not however join the Romanian Army, of which Steaua is the sports club, but worked as a civilian employee. That same year, he won the national championship in foil and won a silver medal in foil and reached the semi-finals in sabre at the Junior European Championships in Luxembourg. He took part in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome but did not earn any medal. He won a silver medal at the Junior World Championships in 1963. During this period he got to know foil fencer and fellow Stelist Ileana Gyulai, who would become his wife. Dr√ÆmbƒÉ became team world champion in 1967 along with »òtefan Ardeleanu, Iuliu Falb, TƒÉnase Mure»ôanu and Mihai »öiu. For this performance he was named \\"honored sports master\\" (). A year later he earned the first gold medal of Romanian fencing at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City with nineteen victories and two defeats.\\"1968 Summer Olympics ‚Äì Mexico City, Mexico - Fencing\\" databaseOlympics.com (Retrieved on June 19, 2008) He also became European champion in 1968 and 1969. He was named the best foilist in the world by the International Sports Press Association (AIPS). The Romanian Government however failed to deliver the promised car and gave out only half the monetary reward it had initially announced. Dissatisfied with the way he and the other high- performance athletes were treated in Romania, Dr√ÆmbƒÉ defected in 1970 to Germany during his stay in Paris for the Challenge Martini, a Fencing World Cup competition: he escaped an official dinner and found refuge at the West- German embassy. His name was subsequently deleted from official Romanian sports records. Dr√ÆmbƒÉ worked for about two years as a coach in Ulm under a contract with the German Fencing Federation. He trained amongst other German champions Matthias Behr and Alexander Pusch. He then left for the United States and settled down first in Tucson, Arizona, where he taught Fencing at Pima Community College. He met and married Cinda Gibson, with the hope of gaining citizenship, and they had a son, Jeffrey. They were divorced, and he then moved to San Francisco, where he opened his own fencing school. He also coached in Venezuela before opening another school, this time in Brazil. He remarried and had four children. In 1996 he decided to return to Romania, where his name had been reinstated in historical records after the Revolution, in the hope that his coaching experience abroad would be rewarded. He received the grade of officer in the Order For Merit, but he did not get any job offer. He also had to retire his candidacy to the Romanian Olympic and Sports Committee. Disappointed, he went back to Brazil, where he died in 2006.

The lake was created in 1903 when Mormon settlers dammed Walnut Creek, a tributary of the Little Colorado River, to impound water for irrigation. History Settlers established communities in nearby Lakeside and Pinetop in the early 1880s. These settlements eventually grew into a single larger community called Lakeside, incorporated in 1986 as the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. Rainbow Lake was originally built as a reservoir for the Pinetop-Woodland Lake Irrigation Company, who own all the water in the lake used for irrigation purposes. Water levels in the lake vary widely, depending on the season, precipitation, and the needs of the irrigation company. In 1998, the Show Low Irrigation Company and the Pinetop-Woodland Irrigation Company merged; however, the land under the lake (to the \\"high water mark\\") is still owned by the Irrigation company as well as all the water. The land surrounding the lake is privately owned and not generally accessible to the public; however, the Arizona Game and Fish Department owns a small parcel of land on the northwest side of the lake at an elevation of , where it maintains a Public Landing for fishing and recreational boating. Rainbow Lake now lies just outside the boundaries of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside, adjacent to Arizona State Route 260. Description Rainbow Lake is , with a maximum depth of and an average depth of . It is a part of the Walnut Creek drainage, which fills three lakes in the area, including Woodland Park Lake (owned by the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside), Rainbow Lake, and the privately owned Lake of the Woods. Rainbow Lake is mostly surrounded by homes, including the private HOA Shores at Rainbow Lake on the southeast side. It is a prominent recreational feature of the Pinetop-Lakeside area, known for its fishing, boating, and wildlife habitats. Currently, Arizona Game and Fish stocks the lake with catchable-sized rainbow trout in the spring and early summer. Naturally propagating warm water species include largemouth bass, channel catfish, black bullhead, bluegill and green sunfish. The lake also contains illegally introduced northern pike. Because it is shallow and weedy, Rainbow Lake is subject to significant water quality problems. In past years, Rainbow Lake has also had a significant problem with invasive aquatic weeds, particularly the Eurasian watermilfoil, Myriophyllum spicatum. Efforts by the local volunteer group Show Low Creek Watershed Enhancement Partnership (SLCWEP), in conjunction with the Little Colorado River Plateau Resource Conservation and Development Area, Inc., resulted in a systemic herbicide treatment of the lake in the summer and fall of 2011. The results were not as good as hoped, with the equally problematic coontail weed rapidly replacing the watermilfoil in the lake. Long-term efforts by the Rainbow Lake Coalition (a subcommittee of the SLCWEP) are now focused on the introduction of sterile white Amur carp, which have been proven to control excessive growth of watermilfoil for up to 10 years. Arizona Game and Fish requires mediation to ensure that the carp, a non-native fish, are prevented from escaping Rainbow Lake and potentially invading other water bodies. The Rainbow Lake Coalition is now working to design and construct a fish barrier on Walnut Creek below Lake of the Woods, which has used the carp for weed control for many years.

Early life Baillieu was born in Melbourne on 6 June 1937, the son of Nancy Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" () and Marshal Lawrence \\"Bill\\" Baillieu. His father was the nephew of entrepreneur William Lawrence Baillieu. An article in The Canberra Times prior to his election to parliament described him as \\"a Beaconsfield market gardener and agricultural engineer\\". Politics Baillieu was elected to parliament at the 1975 federal election, winning the Division of La Trobe from the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) member Tony Lamb. He was re-elected in 1977 but was defeated by the Labor candidate Peter Milton at the 1980 election. Prior to the vote he had been given the highest rating by the Victorian Right To Life Association and Milton had been given the lowest. It was later reported that Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser had pork barreled La Trobe in an attempt to secure Baillieu's re-election, granting a local textile manufacturer relief from tariff reforms. Other activities Baillieu served as the chairman of Mutual Trust, a company established in 1951 to manage his family's wealth. He retired in 2013 and was granted the title of \\"chairman emeritus\\".

The station is owned by Concord-Carlisle High School and licensed to the Concord-Carlisle Regional School District. It airs a high school radio format featuring a wide variety of music genres. The station was assigned the WIQH call letters by the Federal Communications Commission. Contrary to popular belief, the call letters DO NOT stand for Why I Quit High School. WIQH broadcasts student shows 6 days a week (except for Sunday). DJs play a wide variety of music, host talk shows, and also frequently cover Concord- Carlisle's Varsity sports games. The station also features the Fenn School Radio in Concord once a month, alumni shows on the weekends, and several annual special events. WIQH's normal broadcasting hours are from 3:00 to 10:00 p.m. weekdays and Saturdays from 1:00 to 9:00 p.m. History In 1971, WIQH was founded in essentially a glorified closet at Concord-Carlisle High School. It was a 10-watt station, giving it a range of just a few miles on the crowded radio dial of the Boston area. In 1975, when the school completed a large expansion, WIQH moved across campus to a leftover mobile classroom trailer. This would be the station's home for the next 20 years. In the 1980s, WIQH upped their broadcasting hours to 10:00 PM on the weeknights. In 1985 when the FCC revised its rules governing small, non-commercial radio stations, WIQH upgraded to a 100 watt transmitter which doubled their broadcasting range! In the late 1990s, the school struggled to find a faculty advisor for the station and things took a turn for the worse. Sporadic broadcast hours, waning student involvement and aging equipment took its toll. The station briefly shut down but was quickly revived in 1999 with support from students, local parents and community members. In the early 2000s, WIQH moved once again, this time to the l-1 room at CCHS. In 2002, the station celebrated its 5th Annual CCHS Battle of the Bands. Later that year, WIQH broadcast its first automated programming using ‚ÄúSimian‚Äù automation software and a Sine Systems transmitter paid for by a grant from the Concord Education Fund. In September 2009, WIQH began streaming all of its programming live online at WIQH.org. In 2015, Concord Carlisle HS was rebuilt, and WIQH relocated yet again; however, this time space for the station was marked in the building's design plans.

Schroth was an early advocate of fasting and moist heat therapy.Lloyd, Iva. (2009). The History of Naturopathic Medicine: A Canadian Perspective. McArthur & Company. p. 385. He was a haulage contractor by trade, and had vast experience dealing with horses. At age 18, his knee was badly injured by a horse and he successfully treated the affliction using cold compresses. Initially, he met a monk who advised him to wash his stiff joint with wet cloths several times a day. But as Schroth became tired of the repetitious activity, he developed a method of \\"wearing\\" cold compresses for several hours before changing them. Ultimately, the stiffness went away. Now being aware of the effectiveness of the newfound method, he started using compresses for wounds, bruises, swellings, and stiffness of the joints for both humans and animals.Johann Schroth der Naturarzt zu Lindewiese pp. 17‚Äì19 He acquired a reputation as a healer of domestic animals, and subsequently used this treatment on injured humans. Later he introduced steam baths and full-body wraps for individuals without injuries as a means of naturopathic healing. From observations of sick animals that refused to eat, Schroth developed the idea of an austere diet for humans that included a regimen of \\"dry and drinkable days\\". Soon his curative methodology of cold wraps, steam and diet was touted as a means of purification and detoxification of the entire body, physical and mental. Some people considered Schroth a \\"miracle worker\\" during his lifetime, and others thought him to be a charlatan, including several influential physicians. During the 19th century there was a dispute between supporters of Schroth and followers of hydrotherapist Vincenz Priessnitz (1799‚Äì1851), as to which naturopathic system was superior. Around 1830 Schroth founded a health spa at Bad Lindewiese that gradually grew in importance as a cold water spa. After his death the business was taken over by his son, Emmanuel Schroth (1832‚Äì1890), who moderated his father's extreme regimen, and in doing so, increased the number of persons seeking the Schrothkur. Today, the \\"Schroth Cure\\" is still practiced in Europe and elsewhere.

The Romanian premiere took place on December 21, 1981 in Bucharest, The Soviet premiere took place on March 3, 1982 in Moscow.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0155858/  Maria, Mirabela (1981) Plot= Oache (, ), a frog meets old acquaintances: a butterfly, Omide () and a fire-fly, ScƒÉpƒÉrici (). Together they watch two girls playing in a meadow, Maria and Mirabela. Oache remembers an adventure when they all first met each other, and Oache begins to tell the story. The story begins with Oache meeting the Fairy of the Forest who stopped to drink fresh water at his spring. He is surprised to receive thanks from the Fairy for the good water and, being impressed by the visit, he asserts that frogs are not good for anything. In punishment for the lie, the Fairy of the Forest freezes Oache's legs in the stream. Two sisters playing with a ball, Maria and Mirabela come across Oache whose legs are frozen and decide to help him. They are helped by Oache's friends, a bunch of funny frogs. They cheerfully dance and melt the ice around Oache, then the girls take Oache with the remaining ice with them. They want to go to the Fairy of the Forest to cure and release Oache. On the way to the Fairy the girls meet other fantastic beings who need help. They meet ScƒÉpƒÉrici, a fire-fly whose shoes cannot glow because when he lights them, they set on fire. Then they meet the King of Caterpillars whose daughter Omide becomes a beautiful butterfly, but she is too afraid to fly. The girls must get to the Fairy of the Forest before midnight, but time is running out. They visit the strict Lord of Time who does not want to stop the time for them for 5 minutes, so Maria and Mirabella sing a lullaby to him so that he can fall asleep, and time can be stopped. But, the sleeping lord had his arm on Maria's dress, therefore Mirabela hurries to the fairy by herself. But when she reaches the destination, it appears that when the time stopped, the Fairy of the Forest and all of her fantastic companions, including the 4 Seasons, have fallen asleep as well. After the time starts again the awaken Fairy is surprised to see that the old natural order has been disrupted and, as a consequence, the order of the seasons changed, Summer falling asleep near Winter. Because of that the Seasons got a serious cold, therefore the Fairy needs hot tea to cure them. But there is no water available in her kitchen. In order to prepare the medical tea to cure the sick Seasons, the Fairy gets help from the girls who run to Oache's springs. And there Oache helps them to choose the right source with the purest water. As soon as Oache understands that he can be useful, the ice on his feet thaws like magic. Maria and Mirabela then go to prepare the tea, but they have no matches to light the stove. They are helped by ScƒÉpƒÉrici, setting fire to the stove, but his shoes start to burn. Being worried for ScƒÉpƒÉrici, the butterfly Omide flies up and extinguishes the flames with her wings. Mirabela helped by the Fairy gives ScƒÉpƒÉrici new shiny shoes. The final song tells how it is fine to live when friends are near. After that it appears that the adventure was all a girls' dream, the Fairy of the Forest turns into their mother, and the Lord of Time into their father. =Production= The film starred Romanian actors Gilda Manolescu (Maria), Medeea Marinescu (Mirabela), Ingrid Celia (Fairy of the Forest) and the film director, Ion Popescu Gopo (Lord of Time). Musical lyrics were written Grigore Vieru and translated into Russian by Valentin Berestov and Eugene Agranovici. Music was composed by Eugen Doga and performed by Romanian Radio and Television Orchestra, conducted by Cornel Popescu. The songs were sung in Romanian by Anda CƒÉlugƒÉreanu, Mihai Constantinescu, Alexandrina Halic, Paula Radulescu, Adrian Stefanescu and Vocal Group 5T. Russian songs were performed by Leonid Serebrennikov. Gopo used 4 main live action characters (excluding the 4 girls who represent the seasons) and some puppets at first in a real d√©cor. Later the puppets were cut from the movie and in were replaced by some animated characters and also many part of decorum about 80% became based on drawings. The beginning of the movie is entirely animated, but the ending is almost entirely live action. There were also many other minor unnamed animated characters. It was a capo opera for animations. A soundtrack of the Soviet version was authored by Dan Ionescu and Vladimir Kutuzov and character animation was done by Boris Kotov. Editors were V. Istrate, M. Gaspar, and N. Savicev.  Maria, Mirabela in Tranzistoria  The sequel of Maria, Mirabela, this film of 1988 continues the adventures of Maria and Mirabela, this time in an imaginary world inside the TV. Along with the characters played by actors in this movie and three animated characters appear: Oache, ScƒÉpƒÉrici and Omide, which symbolize the three vital elements of nature: water, fire and air, without which there is no life on earth. They turn into humans and interpreted by live actors. The film starred Ioana Moraru, Stela Popescu and Andrianu Kuchinska. Additional crew includes co- director Vladimir Pekar, art directors Tatyana Kolyusheva, Constantin Simionescu, and assistant art director Sergey Mavrody. The film is a Romanian- Soviet co-production made by the Romanian Casa de Filme studio in collaboration with the Soviet Soyuzmultfilm animation studio.

The son of Dr. Henry William Brown and Clara Treacher Brown (n√©e Williams), he was born in Colac, Victoria on 25 April 1894. He attended Geelong Grammar School from 1908 to 1911 and then Christ College at Cambridge University in England where he graduated with a degree in Natural Sciences. He served in the British Expeditionary Force for five years from 1914‚Äì19, being severely wounded and appointed M.B.E and was then with the British Colonial Service for four years in England and Nigeria. G.W.Brown is believed to have served with the Royal West Kent Regiment in France and Belgium, being wounded at the Battle of Loos Appointed MBE on 7 June 1918, he was then posted as a Lieutenant in the role of Administrative Officer and Assistant Adjutant at a School of Instruction. He is believed to have ended the war as a Captain. On 7 April 1921, he married Caroline Mabel Brawn, youngest daughter of G Brawn JP at Lichfield Cathedral. Their daughter, Joan T was born at Atcham in Shropshire in 1922. In 1924, he returned to Australia to become an orchardist in Merricks and living at \\"Moelfre\\". He was president of the Victorian Fruit Marketing Association (1931‚Äì38), Victorian growers' delegate to the Australian Apple and Pear Council (1931‚Äì38), member of the Commonwealth delegation to the Imperial Fruit Marketing Committees meeting in London (chairman in 1934, vice- chairman 1936), and a member of the committee which prepared the Australian case for the Ottawa Conference in 1931. In 1949, Brown was president of the Victorian Fruitgrowers Council and vice president of the Australian Fruitgrowers Association. With the electoral redistribution of 1949 splitting the seat of Gippsland, a new seat of McMillan was created, taking a portion from the neighboring Flinders. Brown was encouraged to stand, although living well outside the seat's boundaries. His campaign manager and successor, Alexander Andrew Buchanan reminisced that Brown would initially turn up for political meetings in \\"old bags (trousers) and gumboots\\" In 1949, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Liberal member for the new seat of McMillan. During his time in parliament, he chaired the Immigration Advisory Council and also of the Government Members‚Äô Food and Agricultural Committee. He held the seat until his death at Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville in 1955, following a heart attack, whilst sitting in the House of Representatives. He was survived by his wife, Mrs. E Brown, a son, also Geoffrey and a daughter, Joan (Mrs William N.R Brisbane).

Born in Fitzroy, the second son of four children of Herbert James Buchanan, a pastry-cook, and Emily Jane, his family later moved to Clifton Hill. He was educated from 1913 to 1919 at Scotch College. Buchanan's father was badly wounded in France in 1916 and this necessitated a schooling change to Hamilton College, before Buchanan won a boarding scholarship to Melbourne Grammar School restricted to sons of former soldiers. Whilst still at Scotch College, he attempted to enter the RAN College at Jervis Bay, passing the academic exams but being rejected at interview, a consequence, he suspected, of political pressure. His mother had firm views on the education of her son, suggesting he learn Japanese, with a view to future trading opportunities. In 1923, Buchanan commenced work for a shipping and import firm, as a junior salesman of bicycles, hardware, cars and motorcycles. He developed an interest in overseas trade. Tariff changes made in 1930 during the Depression impacted the firm badly. In 1929, he married Lydia Mavis Patricia Walton. Both he and his new wife lost their jobs, forcing him to sell soap, vacuum cleaners and other items door to door. In 1933, he was appointed as an agent for a Sydney-based hairdressing supplies business. He then established a business manufacturing hair-dressing products, assisted by his wife, and set up an agency of that business in Adelaide. Whilst he and his wife were returning from this agency, they were involved in a serious car accident, resulting in moderate injuries to Buchanan and more severe ones for his wife that severely impaired the operation of their business. He served in the RAN Volunteer Reserve 1942‚Äì43. He returned to become a farmer at Beaconsfield, where his wife bred Saanen goats, and was an organiser of the Liberal Party in Victoria. In 1955, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Liberal member for McMillan. He held the seat until 1972, when he lost his Liberal endorsement to Barrie Armitrage. He contested the seat as an independent, and lost, finishing last in a field of five candidates with only 6.3 percent of the vote. However, his preferences ultimately helped elect Country Party candidate Arthur Hewson. Buchanan died at Berwick, aged 79 in 1985.

It has eight volumes; the first five were part of the original home-study correspondence course compiled in 1928 by Dr. Harlan Tarbell, the remaining three volumes being added on later. This magic volume series was originally designed as a correspondence course for budding magicians. Once they were collected and bound, the series has become an unparalleled reference standard for magicians. In its impact on the magic world, it is second perhaps in its influence on the art of magic only to Hoffman's Modern Magic, and many professional magicians have based their careers on the Tarbell Course. __TOC__  Structure  The entire collection comprises more than one-hundred lessons in every aspect of magic including micromagic/close-up magic, escapology, mentalism and stage illusions. It is the most comprehensive literary work in magic history. The original five volumes contained sixty correspondence lessons with more than 3,000 illustrations. In addition to teaching specific tricks, The Tarbell Course also teaches patter, marketing, the history of magic, ethics, advertising, routining, presentation, diction and elocution, magic theory, performance theory, acting, misdirection, timing and showmanship. Volume 7 of the series was written by Harry Lorayne and compiled from contributions by other magicians; it is valued largely for its comprehensive index, subdivided by title, contributor, and properties, to the first seven volumes. Volume 8 of the series was compiled and edited by Richard J. Kaufman and Steve Burton. It collected Tarbell's widely scattered and previously uncollected writings on magic, which Kaufman then fashioned into something resembling the first six volumes of the course. Since most of the book was written and illustrated by Tarbell, it is linked more closely to the rest of the course than Volume 7.  History  Publishers T. Grant Cooke and Walter A. Jordan hoped to produce a correspondence course in magic in the mid-1920s and approached Harlan Tarbell and Walter Baker to work on the project. Baker abandoned the project early on to concentrate on his performances. Tarbell was thus dropped from the project. Cooke and Jordan then approached Harry Houdini to create the course. Houdini declined due to lack of time but recommended Tarbell. Ultimately, the publishers agreed and offered Tarbell $50,000 for the course. The series sold 10,000 copies until Cooke and Jordan discontinued it in 1931. In 1941, Louis Tannen purchased the rights to the course and reworked the correspondence lessons into book form and ultimately added three additional volumes. D. Robbins and Co./ E-Z Magic purchased all rights from Tannens in 1962 and is the current publisher and distributor of the Tarbell Course in Magic. The Encyclopedia was also translated into the Korean and Japanese language. The course was ultimately so successful that it became a textbook for magicians all over the world. A magician traveling in India offered to buy some of the secrets of a Hindu Fakir and was surprised to learn that they came from the Tarbell Course. In Africa, tribal medicine men asked that the volumes be sent in a plain brown wrapper to keep their followers from learning that their magic came from Chicago. From 2016 onward, Penguin Magic adapted the Tarbell Course for online video, with each trick and technique taught in order by magician Dan Harlan. It is released monthly, lesson-by-lesson.

Born in Korumburra, Victoria, he was a dairy farmer at Warragul before serving in the military 1941‚Äì45. He was active in local politics as a member of Warragul Shire Council, and was elected to Gippsland Province in the Victorian Legislative Council for a six-year term at the 1964 state election. In 1972, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Country Party member for McMillan, despite receiving only 16.6% of the primary vote. This was one of the lowest primary votes achieved by a successful candidate, elected in a single seat electorate, in the history of Australian elections. His election was made possible by a strong flow of preferences from the Democratic Labor Party and from former Liberal member Alex Buchanan, who was running as an independent after losing his Liberal endorsement to Barrie Armitage. On polling day, Hewson picked up enough preferences from the DLP and Buchanan to overtake Armitage on the third count. He then won the seat on the fourth count after Armitage's preferences flowed overwhelmingly to him. Despite the Coalition agreement at federal level, relations between the main non-Labor parties in Victoria were somewhat frosty at the time. The Victorian Liberal Party Executive created an unusual three-way campaign in 1974 by fielding Armitage against Hewson. A minor controversy ensued when Hewson issued an allegedly confusing How-to-Vote Card (using Liberal colours rather than Country Party colours, and headed \\"Liberal- Country Party Senate Team\\"). Hewson was in turn defeated by Liberal candidate, Barry Simon, in 1975. Hewson died in 1999.

The Hook and Ladder House No. 5 is the second oldest surviving fire station in Detroit, was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1975 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. History Hook and Ladder House No. 5, now Sala Thai The Detroit Hook and Ladder House no. 5 was built in 1888; it was designed by the architectural firm of Malcomson and Higginbotham.Hook and Ladder House No. 5/Detroit Fire Department Repair Shop from the state of Michigan The station was built to provide protection to the surrounding neighborhood and the imminently expanding Eastern Market. In 1911, a small annex was built to serve as a repair shop for the departments's growing fleet of motorized fire engines. In 1917, the larger repair shop designed by Raseman & Frier was built; the 1911 annex joins the repair shop to the hook and ladder house. Hook and Ladder No. 5 was in use as a fire station until 1956, when a new station built nearby replaced it. The Detroit Fire Department Repair Shop was used until recently by the Detroit Department of Public Works as a maintenance yard, carpenter shop, and electrical shop. Description Hook and Ladder house No. 5 is a two-story Queen Anne style red brick and stone building with third floor attic space. The roof is a steeply pitched hip roof with shingled dormers. The original wood swinging doors are still located on the front fa√ßade. Both the small 1911 annex and the large 1917 repair shop are two story brick buildings trimmed with terra cotta. The repair shop has zero setback from the street, yet is clearly designed to relate to the fire station through the positioning of its southwest corner entrance at an angle meeting the setback of the fire station and annex. Current use The properties were listed on the state historical register in 1975, and on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. In September 2002, the Sala Thai restaurant opened in the ground floor of the Hook and Ladder No. 5 building.Sala Thai restaurant The Detroit Fire Department Repair Shop has been renovated, and is now known as the FD Lofts, featuring over 30 loft spaces from 900 to 1700 square feet.FD Lofts ReferencesExternal links *FD Lofts *Sala Thai Category:Defunct fire stations in Michigan Category:Restaurants in Detroit Category:Fire stations completed in 1888 Category:Government buildings completed in 1917 Category:Fire stations on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Michigan State Historic Sites in Wayne County, Michigan Category:National Register of Historic Places in Detroit Category:Thai restaurants Category:Detroit Fire Department ","title":"Hook and Ladder House No. 5‚ÄìDetroit Fire Department Repair Shop"},{"id":"18031577","text":"The following is a list of burials at the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii, in Nuuanu Valley (within Honolulu, Hawaii).

It is the most severe type of multiple endocrine neoplasia, differentiated by the presence of benign oral and submucosal tumors in addition to endocrine malignancies. It was first described by Wagenmann in 1922, and was first recognized as a syndrome in 1965-1966 by E.D. Williams and D.J. Pollock. MEN 2B typically manifests before a child is 10 years old. Affected individuals tend to be tall and lanky, with an elongated face and protruding, blubbery lips. Benign tumors (neoplasms) develop in the mouth, eyes, and submucosa of almost all organs in the first decade of life. Medullary thyroid cancer almost always occurs, sometimes in infancy. It is often aggressive. Cancer of the adrenal glands (pheochromocytoma) occurs in 50% of cases. A variety of eponyms have been proposed for MEN 2B, such as Williams-Pollock syndrome, Gorlin-Vickers syndrome, and Wagenmann-Froboese syndrome. However, none ever gained sufficient traction to merit continued use, and they are no longer used in the medical literature. The prevalence of MEN2B is not well established, but has been derived from other epidemiological considerations as 1 in 600,000 to 1 in 4,000,000. The annual incidence has been estimated at 4 per 100 million per year. \\\\- Chapter: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2B by Electron Kebebew, Jessica E. Gosnell and Emily Reiff. Pages 695-701. This reference quotes a prevalence of 1 in 40,000, but this figure is inconsistent with the same reference's calculated incidence of 4 per 100 million per year for MEN2B. Signs and symptoms The most common clinical features of MEN2B are: A patient with Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B, presenting with mucosal neuromas. Unlike Marfan syndrome, the cardiovascular system and the lens of the eye are unaffected. Mucosal neuromas are the most consistent and distinctive feature, appearing in 100% of patients. Usually there are numerous yellowish-white, sessile, painless nodules on the lips or tongue, with deeper lesions having normal coloration. There may be enough neuromas in the body of the lips to produce enlargement and a \\"blubbery lip\\" appearance. Similar nodules may be seen on the sclera and eyelids. Histologically, neuromata contain a characteristic adventitious plaque of tissue composed of hyperplastic, interlacing bands of Schwann cells and myelinated fibers overlay the posterior columns of the spinal cord. Mucosal neuromas are made up of nerve cells, often with thickened perineurium, intertwined with one another in a plexiform pattern. This tortuous pattern of nerves is seen within a background of loose endoneurium-like fibrous stroma. Causes Variations in the RET proto-oncogene cause MEN2B. In recent decades no case of MEN2B has been reported that lacks such a variation. The M918T variant alone is responsible for approximately 95% of cases. All DNA variants that cause MEN2B are thought to enhance signaling through the RET protein, which is a receptor molecule found on cell membranes, whose ligands are part of the transforming growth factor beta signaling system. About half of cases are inherited from a parent as an autosomal dominant trait. The other half appear to be spontaneous mutations, usually arising in the paternal allele, particularly from older fathers. The sex ratio in de novo cases is also uneven: sons are twice as likely to develop MEN 2B as daughters. DiagnosisDifferential diagnosis= DNA testing is now the preferred method of establishing a diagnosis for MEN 2B, and is thought to be almost 100% sensitive and specific. Gordon et al. reported cases of a difference disease‚Äîthe \\"multiple mucosal neuroma syndrome\\"‚Äîhaving the physical phenotype of MEN2B, but without variations in the RET gene and without malignancy. MEN2B should be entertained as a diagnosis whenever a person is found to have either medullary thyroid carcinoma or pheochromocytoma. Before DNA testing became available, measurement of serum calcitonin was the most important laboratory test for MEN2B. Calcitonin is produced by the \\"C\\" cells of the thyroid, which, because they are always hyperplastic or malignant in MEN2B, produce more calcitonin than normal. Calcitonin levels remain a valuable marker to detect recurrence of medullary thyroid carcinoma after thyroidectomy. Luxol fast blue staining identifies myelin sheathing of some fibers, and lesional cells react immunohistochemically for S-100 protein, collagen type IV, vimentin, NSE, and neural filaments. More mature lesions will react also for EMA, indicating a certain amount of perineurial differentiation. Early lesions, rich in acid mucopolysaccharides, stain positively with alcian blue. When medullary thyroid cancer is present, levels of the hormone calcitonin are elevated in serum and urine. Under the microscope, tumors may closely resemble traumatic neuroma, but the streaming fascicles of mucosal neuroma are usually more uniform and the intertwining nerves of the traumatic neuroma lack the thick perineurium of the mucosal neuroma. Inflammatory cells are not seen in the stroma and dysplasia is not present in the neural tissues. Treatment Without treatment, persons with MEN2B die prematurely. Details are lacking, owing to the absence of formal studies, but it is generally assumed that death in the 30s is typical unless prophylactic thyroidectomy and surveillance for pheochromocytoma are performed (see below). The range is quite variable, however: death early in childhood can occur, and a few untreated persons have been diagnosed in their 50s. Recently, a larger experience with the disease \\"suggests that the prognosis in an individual patient may be better than previously considered.\\" Thyroidectomy is the mainstay of treatment, and should be performed without delay as soon as a diagnosis of MEN2B is made, even if no malignancy is detectable in the thyroid. Without thyroidectomy, almost all patients with MEN2B develop medullary thyroid cancer, in a more aggressive form than MEN 2A. The ideal age for surgery is 4 years old or younger, since cancer may metastasize before age 10. Pheochromocytoma - a hormone secreting tumor of the adrenal glands - is also present in 50% of cases. Affected individuals are encouraged to get yearly screenings for thyroid and adrenal cancer. Because prophylactic thyroidectomy improves survival, blood relatives of a person with MEN2B should be evaluated for MEN2B, even if lacking the typical signs and symptoms of the disorder.The mucosal neuromas of this syndrome are asymptomatic and self-limiting, and present no problem requiring treatment. They may, however, be surgically removed for aesthetic purposes or if they are being constantly traumatized. Abraham Lincoln hypothesis In 2007, Dr. John Sotos proposed that President Abraham Lincoln suffered from MEN2B. This theory suggests Lincoln had all the major features of the disease: a marfan-like body habitus, large, bumpy lips, constipation, muscular hypotonia, a history compatible with cancer and a family history of the disorder - his sons Eddie, Willie, and Tad, and probably his mother. The \\"mole\\" on Lincoln's right cheek, the asymmetry of his face, his large jaw, his drooping eyelid, and \\"pseudo-depression\\" are also suggested as manifestations of MEN2B. Lincoln's longevity (dying at 56 of a gunshot wound and without any apparent suggestion of ill health otherwise) is the principal challenge to the MEN2B theory, which could be proven by DNA testing.Scientist Wants to Test Abraham Lincoln's Bloodstained Pillow for Cancer Discover Magazine April 20, 2009Lincoln's Shroud of Turin, Philadelphila Inquirer, April 13, 2009 See also * Multiple endocrine neoplasia * Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 * Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2a References External links  Category:Hereditary cancers Category:Endocrine neoplasia Category:Endocrine- related cutaneous conditions Category:Autosomal dominant disorders ","title":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B"},{"id":"18031680","text":"The Flag of Sussex is the flag of the English county of Sussex. The flag was registered by the Flag Institute on Friday 20 May 2011 as a 'traditional' county flag as a result of a campaign started in August 2010, by Sussex resident Brady Ells, with support from his father, David. The Flag was certified by Chief Vexillologist, Graham Bartram. It was first flown officially on Saturday 28 May 2011 at Lewes Castle. and was flown from the Department of Communities and Local Government at Eland House, London on Sussex Day, 16 June 2011. Official registered flag The flag of Sussex was registered as a result of a campaign started in August 2010, under the name of Saint Richard's Flag, after the county's patron saint, Saint Richard of Chichester. The flag was slightly altered from the original proposal before its registration by the Flag Institute. The flag represents the whole of Sussex and is based on the traditional emblem of Sussex, six gold martlets on a blue field representing the six rapes of Sussex. The first known recording of this emblem being used to represent the county was in 1611 when cartographer John Speed deployed it to represent the Kingdom of the South Saxons. However, it seems that Speed was repeating an earlier association between the emblem and the county, rather than being the inventor of the association. It is now firmly regarded that the county emblem originated and derived from the coat of arms of the 14th century Knight of the Shire, Sir John de Radynden. Today it is used by many Sussex organisations, such as Sussex County Cricket Club, Sussex County Football Association and also features on the village sign of Ringmer in Sussex. The Flag Institute manages and maintains the national flag registry of the United Kingdom, and therefore this is now the definitive County Flag of Sussex. =Colours= The colour specifications for the Flag of Sussex are: * Pantone Blue 286 * Pantone Yellow 109 Alternative DesignsBBC competition= BBC competition winner The winning entry in a competition held in June 2008 under the auspices of the BBC for a flag to commemorate \\"Sussex Day\\" (16 June) which has been described as a celebration of all things uniquely Sussex. The winning entry was designed by Martin Shrimpton from Woodingdean in Brighton. Chairman of the judging panel, Graham Bartram said: \\"Well it had very clear Sussex symbolism. The colours were bright and I think it's just going to look like a really nice flag.\\"Sussex Flag Winner The BBC competition winner would, according to the Sussex Association, be an inappropriate choice for a county flag of Sussex that is meant to be representative of the traditional county of Sussex, rather than a joint flag for the administrative counties of East Sussex and West Sussex. This flag portrays an amalgamation of County Council arms, which do not represent any county and only represent the councils. The county flag of Sussex does not need to feature the colour red on it to represent the east of the county; red only represents East Sussex County Council. There are many examples where blue is used to represent the county of Sussex, in the east of the county as well as the west. Many of the proposed designs incorporated the charge of six martlets (a mythical bird found in heraldry, essentially representative of a swift) that have been traditionally associated with Sussex for centuries and that have appeared on the various forms of arms used in the county. However, this flag was never registered by the Flag Institute. =Other flags= Previously Proposed Flag of Sussex- Saint Richard's Flag There was also a similar previously proposed Saint Richards Flag with different colours to the registered flag. There was also a flag proposed by the Sussex Party, a minor regionalist group, which proposed a flag consisting of four horizontal bands coloured blue, green, yellow and blue, representing the Sussex landscape, with a yellow disc in the top-left corner representing the sun. An alternative Sussex flag was designed for Sussex Day 2019 with Afro-Caribbean styling to reflect the diversity of Sussex people. The Sussex Motor Yacht Club, located in Brighton, was founded in 1907 and uses a burgee that employs Sussex-related emblems. The club's burgee is blue, with a white shield which bears the six martlets (heraldic swallows) in red (gules) atop a three-bladed propeller. =County Council flags= The flag of East Sussex County Council East Sussex County Council uses a flag based on the East Sussex County Council coat of arms, which also features the six gold martlets from the heraldic shield of Sussex. The flag of West Sussex County Council is commercially available as the \\"Flag of West Sussex\\" West Sussex County Council maintained the basic colours and pattern of the traditional emblem, six gold martlets on blue, but added a gold chief - a bar across the top of the shield. This design is still commercially available as the \\"Flag of West Sussex\\", from a number of outlets. The flag actually represents the 1888-1974 county council of West Sussex rather than the county. West Sussex County Council promoted a different flag to celebrate Sussex Day from 2007.

It specialises in languages, offering lessons amongst others to its students. Overview Hendon School is a mixed comprehensive school with 1,296 pupils on roll, including approximately 240 sixth form students. The school is situated just off the A502 and North Circular Road in London. It serves an area that is generally more affluent than average but has some pockets of deprivation, as interpreted in comparison to national averages according to Ofsted. The student population is culturally diverse, multi-faith and multi-lingual, with more than half of students speaking languages other than English as their first language. The proportion of students eligible for free school meals is well above the national average. The school specialises in languages, and has specialist educational facilities for deaf students and for autistic students. The school has been over-subscribed for the past four years and was designated an Outstanding school by Ofsted in November 2011. The school was previously a \\"failing school\\" in Special Measures by Ofsted in 2005 and subsequently deemed Satisfactory. HistoryFoundation= Hendon School now occupies the site where the 16th-century mapmaker John Norden lived, and only a pond survives from the park of Greenhill. The County School, Hendon opened as a fee-paying school of 350 pupils in September 1914, just a month after the outbreak of the First World War. By 1927 the field at the back of the school was levelled and trees planted, and in 1929‚Äì1930 the building of the Gymnasium was started. In 1931 the intake of pupils rose from a two form entry to a three form entry, and by 1932‚Äì3 the extension on the north side of the original school building was finished to enable accommodation of 480 pupils. In 1936 former pupil Harold Whitlock planted an oak tree sapling in front of the entrance to the Gymnasium which he had received, along with his Gold Medal for the walk, from Adolf Hitler at the Berlin Olympic Games. =Hendon County Grammar School= By 1955 the school had 620 pupils and 32 staff, resulting in a necessary extension on the east side of the main building, which included a new Hall, Dining Hall and Kitchens. This was officially opened in 1961. In the late 1960s, when plans for the reorganisation of secondary education were passed by Parliament, the London Borough of Barnet suggested the amalgamation of Hendon County Grammar School, situated in Golders Rise, with St David's County Secondary School for Boys, in St David's Place, West Hendon. Hendon Grammar School Choir released commercial recordings with Owen Brannigan, with traditional British songs. =Former St David's County Secondary School pre-1971= On 1 October 1929, Barnfield Senior Boys‚Äô School opened in Silkstream Road, Burnt Oak, Edgware with 267 boys. In January 1964 it amalgamated with Brent Secondary Modern School on its site in Sturgess Avenue, West Hendon. Brent Modern School, a mixed school, had opened on 7 January 1936 having been formally inaugurated the previous October by Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, the daughter of Queen Victoria. In readiness for the joining of the Barnfield and Brent schools, new buildings were erected in St David's Place, and the two adjacent sites became one school named St David's after its location. Originally it was to be named The Grahame-White School after Claude Grahame-White, the famous English aviator who had established Hendon Aerodrome, but permission by his family was declined.Hendon and District Archaeological Society =Hendon Senior High School= In 1971 this merger took place. Hendon County Grammar School became Hendon Senior High School, and St David's County Secondary School for Boys was renamed Hendon Junior High School. In 1978, when all the new buildings on the Hendon County site were finished, the whole school became completely integrated on one site and called by its present name Hendon School. During 1987‚Äì88 the school was threatened with closure by the London Borough of Barnet claiming falsely that it was no longer a viable institution, but by 1988‚Äì9 the school had survived the threat and was awarded Grant-maintained status by the Conservative Government. Hendon became a foundation school with the changes to state funding of education which were brought about by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Extensions to the new buildings close to the perimeter on the south side of the site took place during the 1990s to provide extra room for the Maths and Music departments. Hendon School today The school currently has an eight form intake with approximately 1,300 pupils, 120 teachers and 30 ancillary staff as well as a Saturday School for Languages with 200 pupils and 11 teachers. With an expanding sixth form roll, the school built a new Sixth Form Centre close to the eastern perimeter of the 6 acre site in 2011, which provides classrooms and facilities exclusively for use by the sixth form students. In late 2011, the school completed the expansion of the autism unit and the expansion of internal and external dining facilities within and around the original school building. In November 2011, the school converted to become an academy school, although chose not to change the name of the school. The Ofsted inspection in November 2011 graded the school to be outstanding. The school was previously a \\"failing school\\" in Special Measures by Ofsted in 2005 and subsequently deemed Satisfactory. Academic results Hendon School has sustained five years of improving results at GCSE, and in 2011 63% of students achieved 5 A*-C grades, which puts the school in 16th place out of 24 schools in Barnet local authority. At A level, the school is in the bottom 15% of Barnet schools, ranking 23rd out of 26 schools for 3 A Levels achieved.

It is the ichinomiya of former Mino Province. Background The shrine is located in the southwestern corner of Gifu Prefecture, at the foot of Mount Nang≈´. The name \\"Nang≈´\\" derives from its location to the south of the provincial capital of Mino Province. The kami of the shrine is Kanayama-hiko (ÈáëÂ±±ÂΩ¶ÂëΩ), the kami of mining and the metals industry. The shrine precincts contain 18 structures from the Edo period, and is collectively a national Important Cultural Property of Japan. The Hong of the shrine is rebuilt every 51 years. History The shrine claims to have been first built during the reign of the legendary Emperor Sujin (97 BC ‚Äì 30 BC), although there are no historical records prior to its mention in the 836 AD Shoku Nihon K≈çki. The mid-Heian period Engishiki confirmed its status as a major shrine. During the nearby Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, the shrine was completely burnt to the ground and was not rebuilt until 1642, when Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu sponsored the construction efforts.Nang≈´ Taisha . Zenkoku Kaiun Jinja Bukkaku Guide. Accessed May 9, 2009. In 1867, as a result of shinbutsu bunri, the Buddhist temple located on the shrine grounds was moved to a different location. That temple is now named Shinzen-in (ÁúüÁ¶ÖÈô¢) and is still located in the town of Tarui. In 1871, the shrine was ranked as a under the Modern system of ranked Shinto shrines of State Shinto. It was promoted to a in 1925, and its name was changed from \\"Jinja\\" to \\"Taisha\\" to reflect its more important status.

Karnehm was also a professional snooker and billiards player. Besides his commentary, perhaps his major contribution to the game was his development of the swivel-lens glasses, which enabled Dennis Taylor to win the World Snooker Championship in 1985. These were spectacles which were set at a compensatory angle, so the player could look along the shot through the optical centre of the lens. The originals had been designed by Theodore Hamblin, and pioneered by Fred Davis in 1938. Karnehm, who had served a five-year spectacle-making apprenticeship, made many pairs in his family business, but his upside-down design was a considerable improvement - it offered wider peripheral vision - and helped Taylor win the 1985 world title. Despite being best known to snooker audiences, Karnehm's passion was billiards. As a non-professional player, he was a ten-time London Amateur Billiards Champion, and also won the English Amateur Billiards Championship in 1969. That October, he took the IBSF World Billiards Championship title. Karnehm turned professional in 1970, and was a challenger for the world title in 1971 and 1973, losing to Leslie Driffield and Rex Williams respectively. He was Chairman of the Billiards Association and Control Council when the Council nominated Leslie Driffield as the challenger to reigning champion Rex Williams for the professional Billiards Championship. Williams declined to play Driffield within the five months time limit that the BA&CC; Council had set, which expired on 7 July 1970, and forfeited the title, which was then contested between Driffield and Karnehm in June 1971. On 1 October 1970, the Professional Billiard Players Association, which had been reestablished in 1968 Williams and seven other players, disaffiliated from the BA&CC.; It changed its name to the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association on 12 December 1970, and declared itself the governing body for the professional game, recognising Williams as champion. Driffield and Karnehm were, at first, the only two professionals to recognise the BA&CC;'s authority over the game. In 1980, Karnehm beat Williams to win the UK Billiards Championship, his only professional title. Karnehm also turned professional in snooker in 1971, his best result coming when losing 4‚Äì5 to Chris Ross in the U.K. Championship of 1977. Karnehm is perhaps best known for his one-liner when he was commentating on a match between Cliff Thorburn and Terry Griffiths, at the Crucible in 1983. The match was famous because, during the match, Thorburn completed the first maximum at the Crucible. As Thorburn lined up to pot the black, Karnehm uttered the words: 'Good luck, mate'. Karnehm was also a noted snooker coach, and, in 1985, released an instructional video, 'Understanding Modern Snooker'. He continued to coach, and was still President of the Radstock Billiards association until 2000. He died suddenly in 2002, aged 85, after an afternoon working on his garden in extreme heat.

Version 1.0.03 The Surrogatum Principle pertains to a Canadian income tax principle involving a person who suffers harm caused by another and may seek compensation for (a) loss of income, (b) expenses incurred, (c) property destroyed, or (d) personal injury, as well as punitive damages, under the surrogatum principle, the tax consequences of a damage or settlement payment depend on the tax treatment of the item for which the payment is intended to substitute.Krishna, Vern. The Fundamentals of Canadian Income Tax (9th Edition), Electronic VersionPrinciples of Canadian Income Tax Law Surrogatum Principle For taxation in Canada purposes, damages or compensation received, either pursuant to a court judgment or an out-of-court settlement, may be considered as on account of income, capital, or windfall to the recipient. The nature of the injury or harm for which compensation is made generally determines the tax consequences of damages. Under the surrogatum principle, the tax consequences of a damage or settlement payment depend on the tax treatment of the item for which the payment is intended to substitute.Canadian Tax Foundation article As a judge-made tax principle, the surrogatum principle must relate to tax treatment, not just to the nature of the payment, though in most cases the two will go hand-in-hand. The surrogatum principle should apply to assist in reaching a tax result in accordance with the tax legislation, not to encourage a result of either windfall at one end of the spectrum, or double taxation at the other end. The surrogatum principle should apply to maintain tax neutrality of damages.Gowlings - Taxation law If a taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business or earning income from a property receives damages or similar compensation, such as that received as a result of another party's breach of contract or tortuous act, the receipt will be either income or capital for income tax purposes. As a general rule, the courts have held that the character of such a receipt will depend on the character of the item or subject matter that the receipt is intended to replace. This judge-made rule is often described as the ‚Äúsurrogatum principle‚Äù. The general principle is that damages in lieu of receipts that would otherwise have been taxable to the taxpayer are taxable as income. \\"Where, pursuant to a legal right, a trader receives from another person, compensation for the trader's failure to receive a sum of money which, if it had been received, would have been credited to the amount of profits (if any) arising in any year from the trade carried on by him at the time when the compensation is so received, the compensation is to be treated for income tax purposes in the same way as that sum of money would have been treated if it had been received instead of the compensation. The rule is applicable whatever the source of the legal right of the trader to recover the compensation. It may arise [1] from a primary obligation under a contract, such as a contract of insurance; [2] from a secondary obligation arising out of nonperformance of a contract, such as a right to damages, either liquidated, as under the demurrage clause in a charter party, or unliquidated; [3] from an obligation to pay damages for tort . . . ; [4] from a statutory obligation; [5] or in any other way in which legal obligations arise.\\" Schwartz v. Canada, [1994] 2 C.T.C. 99, 94 D.T.C. 6249 (F.C.A.); revd. [1996] 1 S.C.R. 254, [1996] 1 C.T.C. 303, 96 D.T.C. 6103 (S.C.C.)] Thus, one must determine whether the receipts, in lieu of which the damages compensate, would have been taxable. Note, however, the characterization of damages as taxable income or non-taxable capital receipts depends upon the nature of the legal right settled and not upon the method used to calculate the award. =Case law= In the seminal case of London and Thames Haven Oil Wharves, [1967] 2 All E.R. 124, the taxpayer's jetty, which was used in its income- earning operations, was damaged by an oil tanker. In settlement of a tort claim for negligence, the taxpayer received compensation from the owner of the oil tanker, part of which compensated for the loss of the jetty during the period of repair. In holding that the compensation effectively replaced the taxpayer's profits and was therefore taxable as income, Lord Diplock of the House of Lords described the guiding principle as follows: :\\"I start by formulating what I believe to be the relevant rule. Where, pursuant to a legal right, a trader receives from another person compensation for the trader's failure to receive a sum of money which, if it had been received, would have been credited to the amount of profits (if any) arising in any year from the trade carried on by him at the time when the compensation is so received, the compensation is to be treated for income tax purposes in the same way as that sum of money would have been treated if it had been received instead of the compensation. The rule is applicable whatever the source of the legal right of the trader to recover the compensation. It may arise from a primary obligation under a contract, such as a contract of insurance; from a secondary obligation arising out of non-performance of a contract, such as a right to damages, either liquidated, as under the demurrage clause in a charterparty, or unliquidated; from an obligation to pay damages for tort, as in the present case; from a statutory obligation; or in any other way in which legal obligations arise.\\" In Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Fleming & Co. (Machinery), Ltd., (1951), 33 TC 57, the taxpayer received an amount as compensation for the loss of a sales agency agreement with a manufacturer of explosives. The taxpayer had been the sole selling agent pursuant to the agreement. The amount paid to the taxpayer was arrived at by doubling the normal annual commission that it had received pursuant to the agreement. The agency provided between 30% and 45% of the company's total earnings in commissions. In finding that the amount received by the taxpayer was income, Lord Russell formulated the following test, which has been cited in several subsequent Canadian cases and is also described in paragraph 8 of Interpretation Bulletin IT-365R2: :\\"When the rights and advantages surrendered on cancellation are such as to destroy or materially to cripple the whole structure of the recipient's profit-making apparatus, involving the serious dislocation of the normal commercial organization and resulting perhaps in the cutting down of the staff previously required, the recipient of the compensation may properly affirm that the compensation represents the price paid for the loss or sterilization of a capital asset and is therefore a capital and not a revenue receipt ‚Ä¶ On the other hand when the benefit surrendered on cancellation does not represent the loss of an enduring asset in circumstances such as those above mentioned ‚Äî where for an example the structure of the recipient's business is so fashioned as to absorb the shock as one of the normal incidents to be looked for and where it appears that the compensation received is no more than a surrogatum for the future profits surrendered ‚Äî the compensation received is in use to be treated as a revenue receipt and not a capital receipt.\\" In contrast, if a contract constitutes a significant part of the company's business structure, compensation paid on the termination of the contract may be on capital account. In Van den Berghs, Ltd. v. Clark, [1935] A.C. 431, the taxpayer was an English company that entered into an agreement with a competing Dutch company which provided that the two companies (which were manufacturers and dealers in margarine) would conduct their businesses in cooperation with one another along certain prescribed lines and that they would share profits or losses. The agreement was to run for thirty years, but differences subsequently arose over the proper distribution of the profits. A settlement was reached under which a lump-sum amount was paid by the Dutch company to the taxpayer and the agreement was terminated. The House of Lords held that the rights of the taxpayer under the agreement constituted a capital asset and the sum paid for their cancellation was a capital receipt. The case of Parsons-Steiner Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, 62 DTC 1148 (Ex. Ct.) was one of the first in Canada to consider the nature of damages received upon the termination of a business contract. The taxpayer received a lump-sum payment upon the cancellation of a sales agency contract under which it sold ‚ÄúDoulton‚Äù figurines and china products. This agency, when combined with another with the same company, accounted for 80% of the taxpayer's business and in the last two or three years of the agency one of the products accounted for 55% of the taxpayer's business. The agency relationship had lasted twenty years prior to its termination. Given the length of the agency relationship, its importance to the taxpayer's business operations, and the fact that the taxpayer suffered decreased sales by reason of its inability to replace the agency with an equivalent arrangement, the Exchequer Court found the damages to be capital. The Court held that the damages related to the loss of the taxpayer's interest in the goodwill and business in Doulton products in Canada, which the Court viewed as ‚Äúa capital asset of an enduring nature‚Äù. In H. A. Roberts Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, 69 DTC 5249, the taxpayer carried on a mortgage business in one of its five departments, having obtained two mortgage agencies (as well as a third less significant agency). The mortgage department was operated as a separate division from the taxpayer's other businesses. The net income of the mortgage department ranged from 27% to 51% of the taxpayer's total net income. The two agencies were cancelled and pursuant to the agency agreements the taxpayer received compensation payments. The cancellation of the agencies terminated the taxpayer's mortgage business; the department was closed and the staff was disbanded. In holding that the payments were capital, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the loss of the two agencies represented ‚Äúthe loss of capital assets of an enduring nature the value of which had been built up over the years and that therefore the payments received by this appellant represented capital receipts‚Äù. In The Queen v. Manley, 85 DTC 5150, the taxpayer was hired to find a purchaser for the shares of a family-owned company in exchange for a finder's fee. When he found such a purchaser but was not paid, he sued the former controlling shareholder of the company, who on behalf of the other family shareholders had agreed to pay the finder's fee. The taxpayer was successful in the lawsuit and was awarded damages for the shareholder's breach of warranty of authority. In holding that the damages were income from a business, the Federal Court of Appeal held that they were compensation for the failure to receive the finder's fee, which would have been income from a business because the taxpayer had engaged in an adventure in the nature of trade. In Canadian National Railway Company v. The Queen, 88 DTC 6340, the taxpayer received an amount upon the termination of a contract for the transportation by road and rail of certain supplies and building materials. Justice Strayer of the Federal Court‚ÄìTrial Division held that the operations under the contract did not constitute a separate business and that they were not that significant that the termination of the contract destroyed the taxpayer's ‚Äúprofit-making apparatus‚Äù or seriously dislocated its ‚Äúnormal commercial organization‚Äù. He went on to hold that the purpose of the compensation provision in the contract was to enable the taxpayer to ‚Äúabsorb the shock as one of the normal incidents to be looked for‚Äù and that the compensation received was ‚Äúno more than a surrogatum for the future profits surrendered‚Äù. As a result, the payment was income. In contrast, in Pe Ben Industries Company Limited v. The Queen, (88 DTC 6347), heard concurrently with Canadian National Railway, a similar payment was held to be capital. In that case, Justice Strayer concluded that the payment was compensation for the destruction of a distinct part of the taxpayer's business. It had been the first ‚Äúintermodal‚Äù undertaking of the taxpayer, which required it to establish a base of operations at a rail yard solely for that purpose. Justice Strayer held that the termination of the contract put an end to the intermodal operations of the taxpayer, such that the payment was capital. He went on to hold that the taxpayer's rights under the contract constituted ‚Äúproperty‚Äù and that the termination payment constituted ‚Äúcompensation for property destroyed‚Äù and therefore proceeds of disposition received in respect of the property. Since the taxpayer had a nil adjusted cost basis in the contract, the amount of the termination payment was a capital gain. In T. Eaton Company Limited v. The Queen, 99 DTC 5178, the taxpayer was a tenant under a long-term lease for retail space in a shopping centre. The terms of the lease included a ‚Äúparticipation clause‚Äù entitling the taxpayer to 20% of the annual net profits of the shopping centre over the duration of the lease. For several years, the taxpayer reported the amounts received under the participation clause as income. In 1989, the landlord offered to buy out the participation clause for $9.25 million. The offer was accepted and the taxpayer reported the $9.25 million amount as proceeds of the disposition of a capital property that had an acquisition cost of nil. Accordingly, the taxpayer reported a capital gain of $9.25 million. The Minister reassessed the taxpayer on the ground that the entire amount constituted income from a business. The Tax Court of Canada agreed with the Minister and characterized the participation clause as part of an ordinary business contract not forming part of the taxpayer's capital structure. However, the Tax Court decision was overturned on appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal. The Federal Court rejected the Minister's position that the participation clause was analogous to an ordinary trade contract. The Federal Court instead characterized the participation clause as an integral part of the lease, which was a capital asset of the taxpayer. The Court held that buy-out of the participation clause had the effect of diminishing the value of this capital asset by $9.25 million. Accordingly, the buy-out amount was on capital account. Historically, the surrogatum principle has been applied by the courts only in the determination of profit from a business or property under general principles. However, in the case of Tsiaprailis v. The Queen, 2005 DTC 5119, the Supreme Court of Canada applied the principle in its consideration of a more specific statutory provision dealing with amounts received pursuant to a disability insurance plan, namely paragraph 6(1)(f). The case dealt with a lump-sum settlement payment received in respect of a disputed claim under a disability insurance plan. The payment ostensibly represented both past disability benefits accruing to the time of the settlement and the taxpayer's foregone future benefits under the plan. The Court held that the portion of the lump-sum payment reflecting the taxpayer's future benefits was not made pursuant to the insurance plan because there was no obligation to make such a lump-sum payment under the terms of the plan. Therefore, such amount was not taxable under paragraph 6(1)(f). However, turning to the portion of the payment that represented the past benefits under the plan, the Court applied the surrogatum principle in concluding that the portion was taxable under paragraph 6(1)(f) because it was meant to replace amounts that were payable pursuant to the plan. In Transocean Offshore Limited v. The Queen, 2005 DTC 5201, the non-resident taxpayer received a US$40 million lump-sum payment from a group of Canadian residents who had repudiated a bare boat charter agreement. The Federal Court of Appeal held that withholding tax under paragraph 212(1)(d) applied to the payment because it was made ‚Äúin lieu of‚Äù rent that would have been pursuant to the agreement had it not been repudiated. Although the Court did not apply the judge-made surrogatum principle, simply because the ‚Äúin lieu of‚Äù language of paragraph 212(1)(d) effectively constituted a statutory surrogatum rule, Justice Sharlow described the surrogatum principle as follows: :\\"‚Ä¶ a judge-made rule, sometimes called the ‚Äúsurrogatum principle‚Äù, by which the tax treatment of a payment of damages or a settlement payment is considered to be the same as the tax treatment of whatever the payment is intended to replace. Thus, an amount paid as a settlement or as damages is income if it is paid as compensation for lost future rent ‚Ä¶ It is a capital receipt if it is compensation for a diminution of capital of the recipient: Westfair Foods Ltd v. Minister of National Revenue, [1991] 1 C.T.C. 146, 91 DTC 5073 (F.C.T.D.), affirmed [1991] 2 C.T.C. 343, 91 DTC 5625 (F.C.A.).\\" :\\"The surrogatum principle need not be considered in this case because the words ‚Äúin lieu of‚Äù in paragraph 212(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act express a similar idea. The fact finding process that precedes the application of the surrogatum principle is similar to the fact finding process that must be undertaken to determine whether a payment has been made ‚Äúin lieu of‚Äù a specified thing. Here, the fact finding exercise was completed when the Judge determined that the US$40 million payment was made as compensation for lost future rent. :More recently, the surrogatum principle was applied by the Tax Court of Canada in Bourgault Industries Ltd. v. The Queen, 2006 DTC 3420, where a settlement payment arising from an infringement of the taxpayer's patents was held to be on account of lost profits and therefore included in the taxpayer's income. The principle was also applied by the Tax Court in Bueti et al. v. The Queen, 2006 DTC 3047, where the taxpayer as landlord received a lump-sum payment upon the termination of a lease by the tenant. The payment was held to reflect foregone rent under the lease and therefore was included in the taxpayer's income. Both the Bourgault and Bueti decisions were appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal. Those appeals had not been decided at the time of writing.\\" References Category:Latin legal terminology Category:Taxation in Canada ","title":"Surrogatum"},{"id":"18032088","text":"Erez Mesika (; born 1979) is a retired Israeli professional football (soccer) player.

The historic district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1994. The Colchester Town Green is located at the center of the district. Several commercial, residential and civic buildings mostly from the 19th century, surround the green, with the Colchester Federated Church in the Greek Revival style and the Bacon Academy (built in 1803 and separately listed on the NRHP) being the dominant structures. The Hayward House (built in 1767 and separately listed on the NRHP) is located on Hayward Avenue across the street from the green and is now being used as a bed and breakfast. Wheeler Block, the original town hall and also listed separately on the NRHP, is located across the green to the south on Norwich Avenue. Colchester was incorporated in 1698, and was at first a dispersed agricultural community. The village center formed around the town's first colonial meeting house and burying ground, with the area's economic importance later cemented by its location as a crossroads of several early 19th century turnpikes. Bacon Academy was founded in 1803 as the region's first secondary school, and the town was home to the first Masonic lodge in the region (founded 1782). In the second half of the 19th century, the village benefited from the rise of small industries, prompting the construction of a number of commercial buildings, including the fine Second Empire Wheeler Block.

It was named from the Jordan River. The village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Jordan Village Historic District in 1990. Location Jordan Village is located on land known historically as Jordan Plain, a flat land area at the head of Jordan Cove, an estuary off Long Island Sound. The historic district is centered on the intersection of Rope Ferry Road and North Road, two important early roads, providing access to New London to the east, the Niantic River ferry to the west, and the agricultural interior to the north. Although Rope Ferry Road was laid out early in the 18th century, there is only one 18th-century house in the village, and most of its architecture dates to the middle and late 19th century. Most of the buildings in the village are residential in use, with the 1848 Baptist Church the important exception. Jordan Park, a public park established early in the 20th century, also houses the town library and an 18th-century district schoolhouse. The village's origins lie in the founding of the Baptist congregation in 1710, when the area was still part of New London. Sectional differences with Congregationalists in New London led to Waterford's eventual separation from that community. The village's economy developed in the 19th century, with a mill on Jordan Pond, whose remains lie between Rope Ferry Road and Jordan Pond. It experienced a minor building boom after the new Baptist Church was built in 1848; this is when most of its Greek Revival housing stock was built. The village center has remained a well- preserved example of a 19th-century village, with modern development taking place mostly around its fringes.

At the time of their construction, the village was primarily a worker village for nearby shipyards. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The district boundaries includes almost all of what is known as Noank, which occupies a peninsula on the west side of the bay at the mouth of the Mystic River. It includes Elm Street, Prospect Hill Road, and Noank Peninsula east of Route 215, but it excludes certain areas. The nearby Goat Island was excluded from the district, because all early buildings were destroyed by the New England Hurricane of 1938, and various streets near Elm are lined with modern houses that significantly postdate the district. Its streets are mainly winding residential lanes, with a cluster of commercial and institutional buildings at Main and Pearl Streets. Most prominent is the Baptist church, located at the high point on the peninsula. It is an Italianate structure that was constructed in 1867; it originally featured twin towers, although they were swept away in 1938. Another important feature is the Noank Shipyard, at the location of the historic Palmer Shipyard, which was one of the village's primary employers in the 19th century. One significant industrial building is a former velvet mill built in 1905, which also was used by the state as a lobster hatchery.

The district is located south of the intersection of Connecticut Route 164 and Connecticut Route 165, an intersection which is labelled as Preston City on U.S.G.S. topographical quadrant map included in the NRHP nomination document. Developed area north of the district appears to be part of Preston City; the district was defined to focus upon a relatively well-preserved area only. The district is located along Old Shetucket and Amos Roads, which, prior to the 1930s, were major thoroughfares. The historic district was listed on the National Register in 1987. It includes 24 contributing buildings, one other contributing structure, another contributing site, and three contributing objects. It includes representation of Greek Revival, Georgian, and Federal architectural styles. Historically, Preston City was one of three distinct settlements in the town, the others being Poquetanuck and Long Society. The first Congregational church in Preston City was founded in 1698.About Preston , Town of Preston website, accessed September 9, 2009 Preston City prospered in its early years when the town of Preston was an important supplier of agricultural products to the port of Norwich on the Thames River, from which local farm goods were shipped to other ports on the east coast. The period of greatest prosperity was between the American Revolutionary War and about 1830, and is reflected in the architecture of the homes built by successful local farmers and merchants. Historical significance Preston City was established in 1686 as the town center for the newly designated town of Preston. The town of Preston was initially set up as an agricultural community for the port town of Norwich with Preston City as the focus for transporting farm goods to the larger town. Contributing properties Contributing properties in the district include a church, a library, a blacksmith shop, a former tavern, and a poorhouse, as well as houses and some barns. All buildings are of wood-frame construction. The Preston City Baptist Church was built in 1812. The building was turned to a different orientation, and its \\"three-stage steeple and bell tower with a pyramidal roof\\" were added later, in 1832. The James Treat House is the largest residence and is located prominently on Amos Road. The \\"Mott and Downer House\\", a five-bay colonial house, are both on Amos Road and were both built before the American Revolutionary War. The Calvin Barstow House, a Georgian colonial house surrounded by a picket fence, was built during 1786‚Äì1800. It includes a meeting room for the St. James Masonic Temple. The Aron B. Gates House, built c. 1830, on Northwest Corner Road, is a Greek Revival building. It has a barn built c.1900. The Thomas Meech House, built in 1795, on Northwest Corner Road, is Federal/Colonial. It includes a facade overhang that is unique within the district. The Rev. Augustus Collins House, built c. 1830, on Shetucket Road, is Greek Revival. The \\"Old Town Pound\\" on Amos Road is a stone wall enclosure. It served as a pound, a common feature of British medieval villages (where stray livestock might be held). One house, the Ephraim Jones House, used to be the poorhouse of Preston and was originally built in 1733. Other contributing elements include the Civil War Monument and Mott Memorial, erected in 1898. Non-contributing elements include a Revolutionary War Monument dating from 1967 and the Downer-Doane Memorial Park, which, as of 1986, is maintained by the Preston Historical Society.

Running in a mostly linear fashion along Old Norwich Road between Connecticut Route 32 and Richard Grove Road, the area first grew as a settlement of religious non-conformists in the 17th century, developed in the 19th century as a small industrial village, and became more suburban in character in the 20th century. Its architecture is reflective of these changes, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history Waterford's Quaker Hill area was part of early land divisions when New London was settled by English Colonists in the mid-17th century. Much of the land in the area was acquired by James Rogers, whose family eventually split from the local Congregationalist church to form a sect (called \\"Rogerenes\\" after their leader) that borrowed from both Baptist and Quaker theology. The Rogerenes refused to accept colonial authority or pay ministerial taxes, and the village they formed developed without the traditional central meeting house. In 1792, Old Norwich Road was built through the area as a turnpike, joining New London and Norwich. Only a few buildings survive in the village prior to its construction, including the only stone house, built in 1794 for Christopher Green. In the 19th century, the village flourished as a local center of the papermaking industry, and it developed as a streetcar suburb when a trolley line was run along Old Norwich Road from New London. The district is a very irregularly shaped district that generally runs along Old Norwich Road. It includes the center of the historic Quaker Hill neighborhood. It excludes non- historic properties, including entire streets, of modern-day Quaker Hill. It has 109 elements, of which 92 are contributing buildings, over a area. It also includes 16 non-contributing buildings and one non-contributing site. Most of the buildings are residential, reflecting a diversity of architectural styles across the 19th and early 20th centuries. Properties included in the district are: numbers 3 and 5 on Caroline Court; 3 Northwood Road; 2, 11, and 17 on Quaker Hill Green (Old Colchester Road); 2 Richard's Grove Road; 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 15 Rosemary Lane; and 54 parcels on Old Norwich Road ranging from numbers 91 to 209.

Biography Clark was born in Halifax County, North Carolina to General David Clark and Anna M. Thorne. He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he was a member of the Philanthropic Society. His portrait currently hangs in the chamber of the Philanthropic Society wherein aspiring members are expected to memorize his contributions to North Carolina. He served as an officer in the Confederate States Army, in 1861 as a Lt. with the 22nd and in 1862 as an Adjutant in 35th North Carolina Infantry regiments during the American Civil War before enrolling at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After graduating first in his class in 1864, he returned to the war as commanding officer (Major) of the 6th Battalion, North Carolina Junior Reserves. The battalion was quickly integrated into the 1st Junior Reserves Regiment, also known as 70th North Carolina Infantry Regiment, of which he became the lieutenant colonel in 1865. In the 1870s, Clark moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, practiced law, and wrote books on law and history. Clark was married on 27 January 1875 to Susan Washington Graham, daughter of William Alexander Graham. In April 1885, Governor Alfred M. Scales appointed Clark a judge of the superior court, and in 1889, Gov. Daniel G. Fowle elevated him to the state Supreme Court. He was elected to the Supreme Court in 1890, and in 1894, was re-elected with the support of not only his own Democratic Party, but also that of the Republicans and Populists. Clark was elected chief justice in 1902 and re-elected several times. In 1912, he unsuccessfully ran for the United States Senate as a liberal reformer against fellow Democrat Furnifold Simmons. Clark died in office in 1924.  Legacy  Clark's five children attended North Carolina State University. They include Walter Clark, Jr., who is considered to be the youngest person to ever graduate from the university, and David Clark, who later served on the University of North Carolina Board of Trustees. Clark Dining Hall and David Clark Labs are named after Walter and David, respectively.

The historic district is located on a peninsula on the east side of the tidal Niantic River, and represents a cross- section of historic coastal land uses, from farming to a small colony of summer estates to year-round living. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Description and history The Oswegatchie area was first settled by English colonists as farmland, beginning in the late 17th century. In the mid-19th century John Manwaring, a local farmer, took on as boarders workers in nearby granite quarries. He continued to take summer boarders after the quarries closed in the 1870s, and his son expanded that business around the turn of the 20th century, building a hotel called the Oswegatchie House. The area received a boost when a trolley service was run down Oswegatchie Street from New London, and several handsome summer estates were built on the best land at the southern end of the peninsula. Trolley service ended in the 1930s, and the Great Depression led to the failure of the Oswegatchie House, which burned in 1935. After World War II, demand for housing prompted development in the northern part of the peninsula with year-round housing. The historic district is essentially U-shaped, hugging the shoreline along the eastern bank of the Niantic River and the west and north sides of Keeny Cove. Its northwestern boundary is at the East Drive, from which it runs south, around Sandy Point, and along Oswegatchie Road nearly to the head of Keeny Cove. Most of the district's buildings are residential structures, built either between 1900 and 1920, or in the 1940s and 1950s, representing the two major periods of development. The only non- residential building in the district is the Oswegatchie Church, built in 1929 to serve the summer residents.

The area has a remarkable concentration of farmhouses and agricultural outbuildings dating to the early 19th century or earlier. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history The Bush Hill Historic District is located on two ridges, one traversed by CT 169, and the other by Wolf Den Road, with Bush Hill Road providing a connection between them. The twenty houses that appear in the district are typically post-and-beam construction, with a large central chimney and a side-gable roof. Most were built either in the late 18th or early 19th century, and many are also accompanied by 19th-century agricultural outbuildings. The area that is now Brooklyn was settled in the 1710s, with its first church established in 1728. The town was incorporated out of parts of Pomfret and Canterbury in 1786. Settlement in the town followed a pattern typical for eastern Connecticut, with farmsteads established on ridges, and farm sizes typically ranging from 100 to 150 acres. In the early years they were subsistence farms, which were typically developed in the 19th century to specialize in orchards or dairy farming. The Bush Hill area was settled mainly by members of the Williams and Putnam families; Israel Putnam, the most famous member of the latter family, had a large house in the town center, but his farm was not in this district.

The district encompasses the historic village center of Chaplin, which extends for along Chaplin Street, and was most heavily developed in the early 19th century. The focal center of the district is the 1812-15 Congregational Church, which stands on a knoll overlooking the street. Most of the district's buildings are wood-frame houses, although the Witter House (separately listed on the National Register) is a notable brick structure. Stylistically most of the houses are either Federal or Greek Revival in style. In addition to the church, other public buildings include the 1840 former town hall, the 1911 Colonial Revival Ross Memorial Library building, and Eaton's Store, built in 1850. The area that is now Chaplin was settled in the 18th century, its area divided between the towns of Mansfield, Windham, and Hampton. The impetus to separate the community occurred due to the difficulty of area residents in reaching the churches in those town centers. Benjamin Chaplin, who died in 1795, bequeathed funds for the establishment of a church near his (now no longer standing) home. A village center developed around the church, and the town was incorporated in 1822. The village is unusual in Connecticut for its relatively late development, and thus survives as a good example of early 19th-century town planning. Because the center is not near usable water power, and was bypassed by railroads, it was not affected by later industrialization, and was further preserved when Connecticut Route 198 was routed past it in the 20th century.

Most of the district's 62 historic buildings were built in the 19th century, with fifteen houses surviving from the 18th. Architecturally, they represent a cross-section of styles popular from the mid-18th to early 20th centuries, with vernacular forms most commonly found. One of the oldest buildings is a c. 1727 tavern, since converted to a private residence, while the town hall is located in an undistinguished 1920s former firehouse. The town of Hampton was first settled in 1709, and the name Hampton Hills became the name of the crossroads village that arose between the main north-south route (now Main Street) and an east-west route (now Old Route 6).

The district encompasses the commercial business district of Willimantic and is roughly linear along Main Street (Route 66) and Riverside Drive between Church Street and Bridge Street. It was first listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Its area was increased in 1992 to include the Hall and Bill building on North Street, built in 1889 by one of Willimantic's leading printers. Description and history The urban center of Willimantic was first settled by English colonists in 1706, when a sawmill and gristmill were erected near the junction of the Natchaug and Willimantic Rivers. A drop further west on the Willimantic provided an additional source of water power, which was exploited in the early 19th century for the production of textiles. By 1836 there were six textile mills lining the river, and the growth of Willimantic as an urban commercial hub and mill village was in full swing. Main Street, laid out in 1707, formed part of the major east-west Windham Turnpike established in 1799, bringing travelers through the village as well. Later in the 19th century it became a railroad hub for the region, with two major railway lines crossing. Beginning about 1870, Main Street was transformed by this growth from a mainly residential thoroughfare to one lined by commercial businesses. The town of Windham's civic functions were relocated from Windham Center beginning in the 1890s, with the Georgian Revival Town Hall opening in 1896.

The historic district is bounded on the east by Norwich Road (Connecticut Route 12), the north by Railroad Avenue, and the west by Third Street. The complex was started in 1905 by Harold Lawton, a superintendent at the Baltic Mill complex in Sprague, and doubled in size in 1911. Originally the site of a foundry in the 19th century, Lawton's mill turned out fine combed cotton textiles, reaching a maximum capacity of 130,000 spindles and employing as many as 1,200 people. Between 1906 and 1911 Lawton built 125 Colonial Revival duplexes as housing for some of those workers. The success of the mill prompted the growth of Plainfield's commercial district, including the construction of an opera house, bank, and several large commercial blocks. The company suffered financial reverses during the Great Depression, and closed in 1936. A portion of the former mill complex has been demolished and replaced by a large modern warehouse.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description and history The town of Plainfield was settled by English colonists in the late 17th century and incorporated in 1699. A ridge east of the Quinebaug River was where the colonial meeting house was located, and is now where the First Congregational Church of Plainfield stands; it was built in 1816 to a design by Ithiel Town. The road along the ridge, now Route 12, developed as a major north-south route in eastern Connecticut, and was crossed by the road connecting Hartford with Providence, Rhode Island, now Route 14A and Cemetery Road. The town center flourished as a crossroads community into the early 19th century, after which its importance waned in comparison to the town's burgeoning textile mill villages. The district is now mostly residential with some commercial development at its north end. It consists of 30 buildings and 24 associated outbuildings, most dating from the late 18th to early 19th century. Buildings are typically one and two-story frame residences.

The city also benefited from the convergence of several railroad lines, making it an important regional transit center. Its commercial business district formed north of the mills that lined the north bank of the river. Just to its north, the Prospect Hill area was developed as an accompanying residential area beginning in the early 1860s, when Valley Street was laid out parallel to Main Street. Over the next several decades, the street grid marched to the north, generally bounded by High Street to the west and Jackson Street to the east. The historic district covers about 40 square blocks, and has nearly 1000 structures. Of these, 88% are considered historically significant, having been built between 1865 and 1930, representing a remarkably large and dense concentration of historic buildings. There are 600 houses, seven church complexes, six schools, and one firehouse. More than half of the housing was built before the turn of the 20th century. Dominant architectural styles are those that predate the First World War: Italianate, Second Empire, Queen Anne Victorian, Stick and Shingle styles are all well represented, although a substantial number of the examples are in vernacular forms.

Centered at the junction of Plainfield Pike (Connecticut Route 14A) and Sterling Hill Road, it consists of a cluster of 19th and early 19th- century houses, and a church. Unlike other period villages, it has largely been unaffected by later development. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Sterling Hill area was settled in the early 18th century, and was originally incorporated as part of Voluntown. It remained a sparsely populated area through the 18th century, and was separately incorporated in 1794. By this time, Plainfield Pike had become a major east-west road between Providence, Rhode Island and Hartford, Connecticut, with a small cluster of homes and taverns. Upon incorporation, the new town had no defined center and no church. The town voted in 1797 to build a town hall, which in 1812 was made available to a Baptist congregation for religious use. This is the present Sterling Hill Baptist Church, which was given Greek Revival styling in 1859. The village center was entirely bypassed by industrial development in the 19th century, and by the railroad, which passed no closer than Plainfield to the west. and The historic district is centered around the junctions of Plainfield Pike with Sterling Hill Road (which leads north) and Connecticut Route 49 (which leads south). In addition to the church, the district includes 14 older and newer houses that include Greek Revival, Italianate, and Federal architecture. The Dorrance Homestead (c.1716) is a combination of original house to the right of its large chimney, plus a later addition to the left which includes a Greek Revival entry. One house, located at the western edge of the district, extends into Plainfield. A portion of the Plainfield Pike running through the village is also historically significant as the travel route of the French Army during the Revolutionary War. The French camped overnight in Sterling Hill, both in 1781 and in 1782.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history Thompson was settled about 1700 as part of Killingly, and was separately incorporated in 1785. An early tavern stood on Thompson Hill by 1716, serving travelers on what was then the main road to Providence, Rhode Island. In 1730 its residents petitioned the colonial assembly to establish a separate parish, which was granted. Its first meeting house was built in 1735 in this area. In 1797, Thompson Hill benefited from the creation of turnpikes which intersected here (now Routes 193 and 200), spurring additional development and traffic. The area prospered until 1850, when the railroads bypassed the village. The town's economic focus passed to its mill villages, effectively ending significant development at Thompson Hill. It saw a brief revival in the early 20th century, with the establishment of country estates nearby, drawn by the charm of the village. The historic district is in size, and includes more than 100 historically significant buildings. It includes The Cottage House, a historic bed and breakfast, as well as the Thompson Congregational Church, the original Thompson Meeting Hall (known colloquially as \\"The Old Town Hall\\"), the Ellen Larned Museum, and several other historic houses built during the early-to-mid 19th century.

It is roughly linear and extends along East Main Street (United States Route 1) from the Indian River in the west to Old Post Road (Connecticut Route 145) in the east. The area represents a well- preserved mid-19th century town center, with architecture dating from the late 17th to mid-20th centuries. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Description and history The area that is now Clinton was settled in 1663, and was incorporated in 1838, separating from Killingworth. Liberty Green, a small triangular park at the junction of East Main and Liberty Streets, is a surviving remnant of the community's town common and militia training ground. Land for a meeting house and cemetery were also laid out at an early date, now located on Church Street at the western end of the district. This area would serve as the town center of Killingworth (incorporated 1667) until the two towns separated. The town grew as a modest coastal community, serving local farmers and passing travelers on the Boston Post Road (now US 1), then the major road through the region. In the 1840s, Liberty Green was transformed into a park. Economic development of the town center shifted westward across the Indian River in the late 19th century, because the railroad station was located there, leaving the eastern portion of the town with a more distinctively mid-19th century character. The district comprises 154 buildings, objects, sites, and structures that contribute to the historical and architectural significance of the area. Most of these are arrayed along East Main Street, with major spurs along Liberty Street to the north and Waterside Lane to the south.

Description and history East Haddam was originally part of Haddam, from which it is separated by the Connecticut River. It was settled in the 1670s, and its first colonial meeting house was built in Little Haddam in 1704. The town was separately incorporated in 1734. Little Haddam served as the town center, but was later supplanted by locations on the river, where early economic activity was significant, and by Moodus, which developed as an industrial and economic center in the 19th century.

It encompasses the village center of Middle Haddam, a riverfront community founded in the 17th century on the east bank of the Connecticut River. It was an important port on the river between about 1730 and 1880. Its layout and architecture are reflective of this history, and by the geographic constraints of the local terrain. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history Middle Haddam was settled in the 17th century as part of Middletown, Connecticut, and was incorporated as part of East Hampton in 1767. From an early date it was a shipbuilding community, with a sawmill on Mill Brook, which runs through the village. By the early 18th century, a ferry service was operating across the Connecticut River. By the time of the American Revolutionary War, it was a significant but small commercial center for a large agricultural area to the east, and became the locus of a road network serving those areas. It also acted as a shipment point for trade with the West Indies and the North American coast, and was the site of shipyards building ocean-going vessels. The village and historic district are shaped by the local topography. The river forms the boundary to the west, and the inland boundaries are generally the result of steep slopes along the river bank or of the streams that pass through the area. The village's northern boundary is distinguished by a transition to later industrial development of Cobalt village, and to the south by a wooded open space and a more widely spaced development pattern. The district has 58 historically significant primary buildings, most of which were built before 1835, giving the village a distinctly Federal style. Its oldest buildings date to 1732. There is only one example of Queen Anne Victorian architecture, built as a summer residence near the town landing. Among others, the Princeton University and Yale Divinity School-educated Second Great Awakening evangelist James Brainerd Taylor (1801-1829) was born in Middle Haddam's historic district. As a boy, Taylor attended the town's still-standing Christ Episcopal Church (est. 1786).

Mansfield Hollow, located south of Mansfield Center, is one of the places where industry flourished, on the north bank of the Natchaug River, now a short way west of Mansfield Hollow State Park. This area's industrial history began in the 18th century, when Barzillai Swift acquired a water privilege, and established saw and grist mills. His sons George and Fearing continued the business, and also leased part of the privilege to Oliver Bingham. The houses of all three of these men survive in the area today. In 1838 Zalman Storrs established a silk mill, which marked the beginning of textile development and the construction of housing for workers. The silk mill ran for a number of years under several owners, until 1882, when Marcus Johnson built the surviving stone mill for finishing cotton thread.

The district is centered on a mill complex on the Scantic River, which divides the district. The most significant years of development were between about 1835 and 1935, although the area has a history (and surviving structures) dating to the 1760s. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The Mill itself has since burned down and as of October 2018 is currently open field, although the canal structure remains in place. Description and history The town of Somers was settled in the 17th century as part of the Agawam Plantation (now Springfield, Massachusetts), was separately incorporated in 1739, and transferred to the jurisdiction of the Connecticut Colony in 1749. The area that became Somersville village grew around a sawmill and gristmill established on the Scantic River, but remained little more than a rural crossroads village until 1835. In that year, Spencer & Chaffee were the first in a series of proprietors to use the mill privilege for the production of textiles. In 1853 the business was acquired by Holmes & Reynolds, which expanded the mill. It operated through the American Civil War, producing satinet, but closed a few years later. In 1879 the mill was purchased by the Somersville Manufacturing Company, which built the present three-story brick building, and greatly expanded and modernized its production capacity over the next decades. The company also built large numbers of surviving mill housing beginning about 1885, including a significant number of multiunit and tenement-style buildings. and The historic district is roughly T shaped, the base of the T extending along Maple Street on either side of the mill complex. At its northern end it meets Main Street (Connecticut Route 190), which forms the top of the T, extending westward form the Maple Street junction and eastward just beyond School Street (whose section between Main and Maple Streets is also included in the district).

Centered on Elm Hill Road and Main Street, it encompasses a 19th-century mill village, including archaeological remnants of very early cotton-spinning facilities, and old stone dam, and a major wood-frame mill constructed by the Talcott brothers. Also included in the village are a significant number of mill worker housing units, many dating to the middle decades of the 19th century, and an 1891 lenticular pony truss bridge, built by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The village of Talcottville was established in 1802 by John Warburton, an English immigrant who was partly responsible for introducing mechanized cotton textile production into Connecticut. Warburton purchased land along the Tankerhoosen River in what was then part of Bolton and is now in southwestern Vernon, and built a dam and cotton mill, as well as a dwelling that still stands. His mill was the first financially successful cotton mill in the state. A second mill, of which only archaeological remains survive, was also built by Warburton in partnership with Peter Dobson at another mill privilege further upstream. The mill complex was acquired in 1856, by brothers Charles and Horace Talcott, and it is under their oversight that the village achieved its greatest extent. The surviving wood-frame mill building was built in 1870, after the early Warburton mill was destroyed by fire. The Talcotts established a paternalistic company village, building houses for their workers, as well as a school and other facilities. The mills were finally shut down in 1940. The stretch of Main Street on which the mill village is centered was historically a major through road, which was first bypassed by the present alignment of Connecticut Route 83, and then truncated by the major construction work in the 1980s widening Interstate 84. The district's principal features extend along Main Street from CT 83 to where the road crosses the Tankerhoosen River (on a late 19th-century lenticular truss bridge built by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company). The mill complex is located between Main Street and the river, with the principally residential surviving elements of the Talcott's constructions on Main Street and Elm Hill Street. The district includes 32 historically significant buildings, as well as the dams, mill sites, and mill ponds associated with the Warburton, Dobson, and Talcott mills.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. It includes a significant portion of the Branford Point neighborhood, generally considered to be the area along the west side of the Branford Harbor to the Amtrak railroad tracks. It is bounded on the west by the Short Beach neighborhood, on the north by Branford Center, and on the east by the Branford River. Harbor Street, Maple Avenue, and Stannard Avenue are the main thoroughfares of the neighborhood. In the 2000 Census, Branford Point was included by the U.S. Census Bureau in the Branford Center census-designated place. The historic district is a roughly T-shaped area within the neighborhood, extending along Harbor Street from Curve Street in the north to Parker Memorial Park and the tip of the eponymous Branford Point in the south. The crossbar of the T is formed by a portion of Maple Street, and the district also includes properties on Curve Street and Bryan Road. At the time of NRHP listing in 1988, there were 207 buildings in the district, of which 158 were buildings that were deemed to contribute to the historic character of the district. This area is historically notable for housing Branford's highest concentration of late 19th and early 20th century residential architecture. Up to the mid-19th century, this area was mainly farmland and difficult to reach from Branford Center. Harbor Street, with its bridge over Mill Brook, and Maple Avenue were both laid out in 1819, providing improved access. Beginning in the mid-19th century George Parker developed the area around Branford Point as a day resort, with a beach and wharf. His heirs eventually donated the property to the town to form Parker Memorial Park. The northern portion of the district developed as a residential area for workers at the nearby iron foundry (located just north of the district). The result of this development pattern was an assemblage of residences including late 18th-century farmhouses, Greek Revival houses of the mid-19th century, late 19th-century Victorians, and Colonial Revival houses of the early 20th century.

Extending along Howard Avenue between Minor Street and Interstate 95, it contains an unusually high concentration of well-preserved late 19th-century middle class vernacular architecture, reflecting the area's growth at that time. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history According to city maps and records, Howard Avenue was probably laid out in the 1640s. It was largely surrounded by farmland, and in the early 19th century it was given its present wide boulevard appearance, as part of an attempt by developer James Hillhouse to spur residential development. His attempt failed, and it was not until the 1860s, when a horsecar railway was run along the northern section, that serious development began. This development was further spurred by the creation of a large railyard just to its east by the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad, which drew workers to the area. In the early 20th-century, middle-class workers began to move further out into streetcar suburbs. When listed in 1985, the district included 151 buildings deemed to contribute to the historic character of the area. It includes properties fronting Howard Avenue from Minor Street (just south of Washington Avenue) to Fifth Street (just north of I-95). The portion from Lambertion Street to Fifth Street is also in City Point (which today is considered a section of The Hill). Most of the buildings are residential, with wood-frame single-family houses predominating. There are a few brick buildings, as well as a school and firehouse that date to later in the 20th century. The scale of these later additions is of a comparable scale. The houses are architecturally a cross- section of styles dating from the 1860s to the 1910s, typically in vernacular forms with modest adornment. There have been relatively few unsympathetic modifications; these are often limited to the application of modern siding. and Gallery File:Howard Avenue Historic1.jpgNicholas Countryman House, 622 Howard Ave. (1866), Rufus G.

The district also includes eleven houses, built between the mid-18th and mid-19th centuries. The oldest houses date to the 1720s, and the church has a particularly well-preserved early 19th-century interior, albeit with some alterations. One house was built about 1800 as a carriage manufactory. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. The Quaker Farms area was first settled by English colonists in the early 19th century, primarily from Derby about to the south, extending along the main road between Derby and Woodbury. The name \\"Quaker Farms\\" was in use in the 18th century, but its origin is not known. Oxford was incorporated in the late 18th century, and the Quaker Farms area had grown sufficiently by the 1810s to warrant an Episcopal parish separate from that at the town center. This period of growth is reflected in the surviving architecture of the village, which mostly predates 1850. There is a single instance of Victorian Queen Anne architecture, at 489 Quaker Farms Road. A small number of Colonial Revival houses were built in the village in the early 20th century.

Following a redistricting in 1967, Dean represented District 15 until his defeat in 1971. serving on committees that included Judicial Proceedings, Finance, Banking and Insurance, Agriculture and Natural Resources, and Chesapeake Bay and its Tributaries. He was instrumental in the organization of Chesapeake College and Tuckahoe State Park in his district. His brother was three-term Caroline County Commissioner Charles T. Dean, Sr..

Tootill (4 March 1922 ‚Äì 26 October 2017) was an electronic engineer and computer scientist who worked in the Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Manchester with Freddie Williams and Tom Kilburn developing the Manchester Baby, \\"the world's first wholly electronic stored-program computer\\".Hollingdale, S. H., & Tootill, G. C. (1967). Electronic computers, Harmondsworth, Mddx.: Penguin Books. Computing Heritage (2013) Education Tootill attended King Edward's School, Birmingham on a Classics scholarship and in 1940 gained an entrance exhibition to study Mathematics at Christ's College, Cambridge. He was forced to do the course in two years (missing Part One of the Mathematics Tripos) as his studies were cut short by World War II. After the successful operation of the Manchester Baby computer, he was awarded an MSc by the Victoria University of Manchester for his thesis on \\"Universal High-Speed Digital Computers: A Small-Scale Experimental Machine\\". Career On leaving Cambridge in 1942, Tootill managed to get assigned to work on airborne radar at the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in Malvern. Here, he went out to airfields to troubleshoot problems with the operation of radar in night fighters, designed modifications and oversaw their implementation. He later said that this was the most responsible job that he had in his life, at the age of just 21. In 1947, he was recruited by Frederic Calland Williams to join another ex-TRE colleague, Tom Kilburn, at Manchester University developing the world's first wholly electronic stored-program computer. In the UK, three projects were then underway to develop a stored program computer (in Cambridge, the NPL and Manchester) and the main technical hurdle was the memory technology. In order to test the cathode ray tube memory designed by FC Williams when it was constructed, Kilburn and Tootill designed an elementary computer, known as the \\"Manchester Baby\\". The computer could store 32 instructions or numbers using a single Cathode Ray Tube (CRT). On 21 June 1948, after months of patient work constructing and testing the Baby piece by piece, coping with the unreliable electronic components of the day, the machine finally ran a routine written by Kilburn (they didn't use the word \\"program\\" then) to find the highest proper factor of a number. In Tootill's words \\"And we saw the thing had done a computation\\". A day or two later, the Baby ran successfully for 52 minutes to find the highest proper factor of 218, which required c. 3.5m arithmetic operations. During the development of Baby, the team used to speculate on how the computer would be used for real work: weather forecasting, atomic research, etc. They thought that only the government would need computers in the United Kingdom, maybe 2 or 3, but in the United States they might need as many as half a dozen! They could not have foreseen how their invention would change the world. After the Baby's first operation in June 1948, Alan Turing moved to Manchester so he could use the Baby for a project that he was working on at the National Physical Laboratory, where they had also been working on developing a computer. Tootill instructed Alan Turing on use of the Manchester Baby and debugged a program Turing had written to run on the Baby. In 1949, Tootill joined Ferranti where he developed the logic design of the first commercial computer (which was based on the Baby). He stayed at Ferranti only briefly and later the same year, he joined the Royal Military College of Science at Shrivenham as a Senior Lecturer on a considerably higher salary, lecturing and leading lab studies on digital computing. In 1956, Tootill joined the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), Farnborough, researching issues for air traffic control systems. Here he wrote, with Stuart Hollingdale, \\"Electronic Computers\\", Penguin 1965, which ran through eight printings and was translated into Spanish and Japanese. Tootill was also a founding member of the British Computer Society in 1956. In 1963, Tootill joined the newly formed European Space Research Organisation (ESRO, now the European Space Agency). He set up and directed the Control Centre of ESRO, with its ground stations. In 1969, he was assigned to a bureaucratic post in London, which he did not enjoy. In 1973, he joined the National Physical Laboratory at Teddington, where he developed communications standards for the European Informatics Network, an experimental computer network. Tootill retired in 1982, but remained active in computing. In 1997, drawing on his linguistics background (notably Latin, Greek, French and German), he designed a phonetic algorithm for encoding English names (to recognise that e.g. Deighton and Dayton, Shore and Shaw sound the same) which garnered over 2,000 corporate users as part of a data matching package developed by his son Steve. In 1998, the Computer Conservation Society (in a project led by Christopher P Burton) unveiled a replica of the Baby (which is now in the Museum of Science and Industry (Manchester)) to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the running of the first electronically stored program, based in large part on Tootill's notes and recollections. A page from his June 1948 notebook details the code of the first ever software program, written by Tom Kilburn. Personal life As a boy, Tootill was interested in electronics, and built a radio set. He met Pamela Watson while in Malvern during World War II, where they were both members of the \\"Flying Rockets Concert Party\\". He and Pam were married in 1947 and had three sons, Peter, Colin and Steven and two grandchildren, Mia and Duncan. His first wife Pam died in 1979, and in 1981, Tootill married Joyce Turnbull, who survived him.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The district runs along both sides of Main Street from the Scantic River south to the Edwards Cemetery. The district also includes areas west of Main Street to the Connecticut River, including properties along Ferry Lane. The district is located directly north of another historic district, Windsor Farms Historic District. The district encompasses a neighborhood of well-preserved largely folk vernacular buildings erected between about 1700 and 1860. Description and history The East Windsor Hill area was settled in 1638 by families from Windsor, just across the Connecticut River to the west. The two communities were joined by the first ferry service to span that river, established in 1604 by John Bissell. The eastern end of the ferry was located at the western end of Ferry Lane, a short way south of the mouth of the Scantic River, and includes a surviving ferry tavern house dating to about 1750. Mainly agricultural in character, the village received a boost in the 1830s, when the theologically conservative Theological Institute of Connecticut was established here. Although none of its academic buildings survive, homes of people associated with the institution do. The architecture of the East Windsor Hill village is diverse, representing over 150 years of largely vernacular domestic architecture. Several houses were built in the high Federal style, typically for merchants who were dealing in the area's agricultural products. A number of locally well-known builders constructed houses in the village, and there are several fine instances of the elaborate carved doorway surrounds for which the Connecticut River valley is well known. Probably the finest example of Greek Revival architecture in the district is the 1835 high-style home of Bennett Tyler, the first president of the Theological Institute.

It includes the ferry landings and water traversed by the Rocky Hill ‚Äì Glastonbury Ferry, one of the longest-running ferry services the nation, and the surrounding farmscapes and ferry landing village. and The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. History The towns of Rocky Hill and Glastonbury were originally settled in the mid-17th century as part of Wethersfield, from which they were separated in 1843 and 1693 respectively. Although they followed somewhat different paths of development, the ferry, established in 1655, has been a continuing presence joining the landing areas on either side of the Connecticut River. The area of South Glastonbury that surrounds the eastern ferry landing has a long history of agricultural use. The broad meadows in the Connecticut River flood plain were used agriculturally by Native American prior to the arrival of English colonists, and were surveyed and subdivided by Wethersfield residents in the 1640s. Houses were built just above the flood plain on what is now Tryon Street. The oldest house in the district, the c. 1700 Thomas Treat house, is located on Tryon Street, as are several other early 18th-century houses. Later development in the 18th and 19th centuries added farm buildings and ferry- related infrastructure to the Glastonbury side of the district. Landowners in this area retained and maintained family and business connections with those across the river. Rocky Hill remained part of Wethersfield much longer, and the Rocky Hill Landing area became its principal port area after a major flood in 1700 wiped out Wethersfield's old port area. The landscape on the west side of the river is characterized by a narrow flood plain, most of which was held in common by the town and has never been significantly developed. A steep bluff separates the landing itself from the main town economic center, and shaped its development in the 18th and early 19th century as a port and shipbuilding center. The Connecticut Valley Railroad was built through the landing area in 1871, providing transport to market for goods produced in South Glastonbury.

The Rocky Hill‚ÄìGlastonbury ferry was at the time the only river crossing between the two communities, and High Street, extending east from the ferry, is the oldest road in Glastonbury. South Glastonbury developed as the town's first village, spurred in part by the development of grist and saw mills on Roaring Brook to the east. These were augmented by textile mills and other industry, prompting further growth in the 19th century. By the early 20th century these industries had closed or were in decline. The village center is a triangle made up of all or part of Main, High, and Water Streets, and includes 83 contributing resources, including the public library, located in a former Methodist Church built in 1828, a c. 1740 house at 120 High Street, and the c. 1878 Carpenter Gothic St. Augustine's Church. The oldest surviving building is the c. 1731 Tryon House at 879 Main Street. One building was previously listed on the National Register: the Welles-Shipman-Ward House, a fine Georgian house built about 1755. South Glastonbury contains Nayaug Elementary School, which opened August 2007.

It encompasses the historic village of West Granby, which extends along Simsbury Road between Firetown Road and Hartland Road. Although this area was settled in the 18th century, and has a few surviving buildings from that time, its most significant period of development was in the 19th century, when industry came to play a role in the area. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The area that is now West Granby village was first settled in the early 18th century, and was largely agrarian, with a sawmill established on the West Branch Salmon Brook about 1742. In 1784, the water power of the brook was harnessed for a gristmill, carding mill, trip hammer facility, and gin distillery. By 1819 it was one of the town's most important economic centers. These small industries survived roughly until the American Civil War, after which they were unable to compete with similar businesses of larger scale in urban settings. The area experienced an agricultural revival in the early 20th century, when shade-grown tobacco was introduced. The district is roughly linear in shape, extending along Simsbury Road from Hartland Road in the north to Firetown Road in the south, with several listed buildings on Hartland Road and West Granby Street. Most of the district's 113 buildings primary buildings are residential, although there are many agricultural outbuildings and garages. The houses are typically in simple vernacular interpretations of architectural styles popular during their construction, and represent a cross section of 19th-century and early 20th-century architecture. There are only a few minor instances of the village's industrial buildings that survive, and one church.

The district includes parts of Georgetown in the towns of Redding, Weston, Wilton, and Ridgefield and consists of the former Gilbert & Bennett manufacturing plant, institutional housing built for the plant workers, other private homes, and the Georgetown business district. and In its 1986 National Register nomination, the district is described as \\"[A] rare survival of rural industrial history\\". The company began as a cottage industry weaving animal hair from cows and horses, started by Benjamin Gilbert. Water power was needed, and the enterprise used a former sawmill facility downriver from the later factory site. The company found success making sieves from animal hair. After much development and a fire, the company focused on wire products including woven wire cloth for meat safes, the first insect wire screening, and poultry netting. The company is described as having been \\"[g]uided by nineteenth-century paternalism and enlightened self-interest which carried over well into the twentieth century\\" for it having \\"shaped a community which today resembles the rural industrial village of nineteenth-century Utopian ideology.\\" The district consists of properties that are roughly bounded by Route 7, Portland Avenue, Route 107, and the Norwalk River.

About 30 years earlier, his father had started brewing beer in Greece. As purveyor to the court of the Greek king, the company was able to maintain a monopoly position in the Greek market for about 100 years. After the bankruptcy of the company in 1983 and several failed revival attempts to revive it, Fix beer has been brewed again in its own brewery since 2009. The reason for this is the relatively high popularity of beer in the country for Mediterranean countries.  History  Beer enjoyment in the young Greek state = 19th century advertisement In 1833, Adolph von Schaden, in a report about the Bavarian emigrants, mentioned the popularity of the British Porter beer among the Greek aristocracy. The same year, beer was also exported from Naples to Greece. Already before the Greek Revolution, there had been a first successful attempt to brew beer in Greece by an Armenian brewer in Tripoli. Briefly, damage to the beer production in Greece predicted good economic successes and recommended, in particular, Joseph Pschorr, to send one of his sons to build a brewery in Greece. = Foundation of the Athenian brewery = Karl Johann Fix (Karolos Ioannou Fix), the son of Johann Ludwig Fix The brewery founder's father, Johann Adam Fix, a miner from Edelbach in Spessart, had followed the call of King Otto to Greece and had - like other Bavarians - settled in Iraklion near Athens.Alfred Diel: Johann Georg Fix. Griechenland 1854 mit bayerischem Bier erobert. In: Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr Heimatforschung und Heimatpflege Kahlgrund e.V., Sitz Alzenau (Hrsg.): Unser Kahlgrund 2004. Heimatjahrbuch f√ºr den ehemaligen Landkreis Alzenau. 49. Jahrgang, Selbstverlag Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr Heimatforschung und Heimatpflege Kahlgrund e.V., Karlstein/Main 2004. ‚Äì Diese Quelle widerlegt die oft kolportierte, aber unbelegte Behauptung, Fix habe erst Fuchs gehei√üen und aus M√ºhldorfgestammt. He was responsible in the management of the mines in Kymi, Euboea. Earlier, he had left his son Johann Georg behind with his mother. When Johann Georg traveled to his father at the age of twenty, he was to be picked up in Piraeus; but his father was murdered on the way by robbers. After the event, Johann Georg Fix was rescued in Iraklion, he stayed there and started to import barrels of beer from Bavaria. Later, he decided to produce beer himself and launched a small enterprise selling his home made beer Kolonaki (today's expensive and celebrated shopping area in the heart of Athens), which was a good place for socialising for the Athenian Bavarian community. Joseph von Ow, who was in the service of the Athenian royal court in 1837-39, wrote in his memoirs: > \\"The Bavarian compatriots have company among themselves. - A brewery has > been in operation in Athens for two years and is being used heavily. > Professor G. everus from Oldenburg rightly notes how excellent it must be > for a Bavarian soul to have his patriotic drink here - on the border of the > Orient! A society> To the Green Tree <(with garden, bowling alley, stone > beer steins, singing and loud conversations) reminds of the far bank of the > Isar! \\" Bavarian lion logo. Around 1840, the beer is said to have prevailed throughout Greece.Elisabeth von Dryander: Six times Greece . 1969 p. 152 Johann Ludwig's son Karl Johann Fix (Karolos Ioannou Fix) in 1864 founded the Fix brewery in Athens, coinciding with the appointment of the next king of Greece, George Christian Wilhelm Glyxbourg, from beer-loving Denmark. The new royal court encouraged Charles's efforts, and Fix Company soon became the official purveyor to the Greek Royal Court, and has been the only major in the country till the middle of the 20th century. It was located at the foot of Lycabettus also in Kolonaki and competed with small breweries such as Guilelmos (Wilhelm) and imported beer from Trieste and Vienna ( Schwechat ). The German brewers (including Fix) are said to have barely met the demand for beer and \\"became wealthy in a short time\\".Siegfried Mackroth: Das Deutschtum in Griechenland. 1930, S. 45 Beer was therefore more expensive than wine.Henry Clifford Darby: Greece: Economic geography, ports, and communications. 1945, S. 134 Around 1905, 89,000 hectoliters were produced in eleven breweries.Deutsche Rundschau f√ºr Geographie und Statistik 27/1905, S. 83 = Monopoly = Unlike the breweries Fischer (Œ¶ŒØœÉŒµœÅ), Bachauer (ŒúœÄŒ±œáŒ¨ŒøœÖŒµœÅ) and Melcher (ŒúŒ≠ŒªœáŒµœÅ), the Fix beer was characterized by a constant quality and had prevailed since at least the first half of the 20th century. In 1925, the brewery invested in a refrigerating machine with a capacity of 2 to 6 million BTU by Sulzer AG , which cooled the entire cellar.Sulzer technical review, Vol. 82, 1949, p. 31Modern refrigeration, Vol. 55, Empire House 1952, p. 163 Until the 1950s, this was one of the most powerful compressors ever. Previously, it was only cooled with bar ice, of which one built by LA Riedinger plant produced 1000 kg a day.United States. Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce: Trade Information Bulletin: Issue 382-401, 1939 \\"The good and light fix beer (birra) was available in every restaurant. It cost 5 drachmas per glass of beer, 18 drachmas per 1 bottle\\" as mentioned in a 1937 Athens travel guide.Georg Karo: Athen und Umgebung, Grieben-Verlag, 1937, S. 30 During the Nazi occupation of Athens, Antonios (Anthony) and Elli Fix hid the Jewess Yvonne Molho in their house. (In 2004, their names were added to the Righteous Among the Nations list). At that time, the brewery also had its own bar in Patisia, which was visited mainly by Germans.Alfred Philippson/Hans B√∂hm: Wie ich zum Geographen wurde, aufgezeichnet im Konzentrationslager Theresienstadt zwischen 1942 und 1945, 2000, S. 321 The late 1920s logo, blue / white combined with rhombic design features After studying chemistry at the University of Lausanne and two years of working as a chemist in the Greek military Karolos Fix took over in 1950 (as the son of Antonios Fix) the management of the company and the technical director during the 1960s was the German Dr. Karl Lietz. In 1965, the new brewery designed by Takis Zenetos was opened on Syngrou Avenue . The high profits from the de facto beer monopoly were partly invested in other beverage companies, which also sought a monopolistic position, including Tam-Tam (a Cola drink) and Retsina Plaka ( Retsina was then the most popular table wine). The brewery advertised labels with the status of court purveyor of the Greek court and with reference to 38 won gold medals. = Decline and bankruptcy = In the early 1960s, the brewery was accused of quasi-monopoly that specifically prevents the market entry of other breweries in Greece. On 15 July 1965, the government took the decision to facilitate the entry of foreign breweries into the market. In the same year Amstel Hellas was initiated as branch of the Dutch brand Amstel. After the defense secretary of the Greek junta , Garoufalias, had married into the Fix family, the company's reputation was badly damaged. The slogan \\"i bira fix kani kalo\\" (Œ∑ ŒºœÄŒØœÅŒ± Œ¶ŒπŒæ Œ∫Œ¨ŒΩŒµŒπ Œ∫Œ±Œªœå, fix beer is good ') was reworded as \\"i bira fix kani kako\\" (Œ∑ ŒºœÄŒØœÅŒ± Œ¶ŒπŒæ Œ∫Œ¨ŒΩŒµŒπ Œ∫Œ±Œ∫œå, fix beer is bad). \\"No one wants to drink more junta beer,\\" as mentioned by Spiegel 1974. In 1977-1983, the brewery's shareholders filed a legal dispute, first with the city of Athens and then with the state, which involved the provision of real estate and the relocation of the brewery. Fix wanted to convert the brewery facilities into a shopping center.R. Doak Bishop/James Crawford/William Michael Reisman: Foreign investment disputes: cases, materials, and commentary. S. 479 Meanwhile, there too many new breweries were launched, mostly as branches of foreign brewers (u. A. L√∂wenbr√§u Hellas, Henninger Hellas, Amstel , Heineken ) and Fix lost enormous market share. Karolos Fix, descendant of the founder, and his wife Ninetta moved their main residence in 1982 to Gstaad, where many Greek millionaires live. In the same year, Karolos started the Fix Asset Management, which today manages assets of ‚Ç¨12 billion in 300 funds. A year later the brewery Fix went bankrupt. The naming rights went to the National Bank of Greece , where the brewery was heavily in debt. The former company archive has since been located in the Historical Archive of Macedonia in Thessaloniki. = Resurgence of the brand Fix = Can and bottle until 2009 Already in 1985 John Manolakos from the company Greco-Roman Importers from Florida had tried to revive the brand and brew a beer called FIX Special at Carlsberg in Greece. The project failed for unknown reasons. In 1995 Aris Zizis protected the Fix 1864 Special brand in the United States with the aim of brewing the beer at the Holsten brewery in Germany and exporting it to the US and Greece. Kourtakis had in the meantime acquired the trademark rights of the old brewery from the owner National Bank of Greece for 120 million drachma plus 1.5 percent of sales and could thus prevent the misappropriation of the trade mark. He founded the Olympic Brewery ( Olymbiaki Zythopiia ŒüŒªœÖŒºœÄŒπŒ±Œ∫ŒÆ ŒñœÖŒ∏ŒøœÄŒøŒπŒØŒ±) and had the beer brewed in the varieties Lager and Export at Mythos in Atalanta near Thessaloniki. The success was rather small. Meanwhile, Fix was authorized brewed in the US and Canada. In the meantime, Karolos Fix had a beer brewed in Holland according to his own old recipe and the name Karolos I. Fix, which was sold in Greece via the supermarket chain of his brother-in-law Marinopoulos. However, this was stopped in court. The fix brand started to be produced in 2008 by the Olympic Brewery to Greek microbreweries ( Ellinikes Mikrozythopiies, ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ ŒúŒπŒ∫œÅŒøŒ∂œÖŒ∏ŒøœÄŒøŒπŒØŒµœÇ), since the output was only 1000 hectoliters. Sklavenitis was the only supermarket chain to sell the beer. Can and bottle since 2010 In 2009, the Olympic Brewery was sold to the previous minority shareholder Chitos AVEE. The old Fix logo was reintroduced and a separate brewery for the brand was put into operation in Ritsona of Euboea island. There, only lager beer with an alcohol content of 5% is brewed. In 2009 there was achieved a beer output of 150,000 hectoliters. The ingredients come from organic agriculture, although the product bears no biolabel. Since 2010, FIX beer has been available again.(A set of news postings about the production of beer by Hitos AVEE, in Greek) The relaunched beer has a new label, with references to the gold medals and prizes won by the original FIX beer. An aggressive advertising campaign, with references to the strong historic legacy of FIX beer in the Greek society, has dramatically boosted sales, effectively leading to a strong comeback of the brand. Ownership and usage of the historic trademark has been a source of conflict; there are Fix Beers brewed in the United States and in Canada which claim to use the Fix recipes.Fix Beer USA , Muskoka Fix Beer Œôn 2015, the Olympic Brewery merged with the myth Brewery . Since then, both breweries are majority owned by Carlsberg. Œô  Former brewery locations  The company has had breweries in several locations at different times, including the following in Attica: Karneadou / corner Irodotou street, Timoleontos street 7 (now Ypsilantou), Gragratetta field to Makrigianni / Kallirois street, and finally Syngrou Avenue. Also: Heraklion, Kolonaki and Patissia. Plus at least two locations in Thessaloniki. = The brewery at Syngrou = The old brewery on Syngrou Avenue, was demolished and replaced in 1965 by a new building. This is an early work by Takis Zenetos, an 'Enfant terrible' of Greek architecture. Nevertheless, because of its size, it became the symbol of an ignorant large- scale industry, and its residents called for its demolition and the construction of a park back in 1982. In 1994, the former brewery building on Syngrou Avenue was sold to the Attiko Metro subway operator, who intended to build an underground garage and a park above. Numerous preservationists and fans of the architect demonstrated. After partial demolition of about 40% of the building and fierce protests, the car park investor gave in and limited himself to the already demolished area, where a lower building was built.

Klonaridis built a large brewery complex at the intersection of Patision / Kaftantzoglou north Athens, which was acquired in 1930 by Fix and was ultimately used for the production of ice cream. The historic structure was demolished in 2000, following a directive from the Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos, after a battle for its preservation was lost in favor of creating a park.Demolition of old FIX factory on Patission Ave. All that remained was Villa Klonaridi, residence of the builder. Opposite still reminds a Caf√© Fix to the location of the brewery, the area was named after the first owner Klonaridis. = Thessaloniki = Near the harbor (October 26 street) there is an ensemble of brick buildings and ruins. On the site, previously occupied by a vineyard, the brewery was built in 1882 under German Mizrachi Fernandez (ŒúŒπœÉœÅŒ±œáŒÆ-Œ¶ŒµœÅŒΩŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒµŒ∂) plans, and was renamed in 1912 to brewery Olymbos (ŒñœÖŒ∏ŒøœÄŒøŒπŒµŒØŒø ŒüŒõŒ•ŒúŒ†ŒüŒ£), and after a merger as Olymbos Naoussa. Fix acquired the brewery in 1926 and brewed at the site until the bankruptcy in 1983. On the outside of the building are still large writings with the inscription ZYTHOPIIA KAROLOS FIX, The abandoned buildings were at first occupied illegally and used for cultural events and social events and then regularly rented. Requests for monument protection were dismissed several times, in part challenged by the owners of the site. Since 2004, the site is irrevocably under monument protection law. A restoration remains uncertain.  Beer in Greece  The market is dominated by three major breweries, Athenian Brewery with the brands Heineken and Amstel comes to 70%, followed by Carlsberg A / S with the brands Mythos , Henninger , Foster's and Guinness . Third place goes to the Olympic Brewery, owner of the brand Fix. 95% of the beer consumed is produced in Greece. In general, beer consumption in Mediterranean countries is well below the European average. Greece is no exception, but ranked ahead of Italy and France in 1995.Birgit Speckle: Controversy over beer in Bavaria: Values of purity, community and tradition. Waxmann-Verlag, 2001, p. 250 Beer consumption increased by 20% between 1996 and 2004, whereas beer is a pure seasonal beverage in Greece, 60% of the bottles sold are sold between May and September. Beer consumption in Greece is strongly weather dependent.  Trivia  * In 1904 the brewery Fix & Cie was founded in Niedermendig.after M. Friedrich Heidelberg: List of former Niedermendiger breweries.

Centered on the junction of John Street and Round Hill Road, the district includes a church, cemetery, two houses, and a former district school, the latter dating to 1750. Established as a center for local farmers in the 18th century, it was transformed in the early 20th century into a center for suburban and summer estate residents. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history The Round Hill area began as a \\"backcountry\\" farming region of Greenwich, populated by English settlers who moved inland from its coastal areas, and by Dutch settlers from New Amsterdam and the Province of New York, both of which contested control of the area through the late 17th century. The oldest building at Round Hill is the Brown-Kenworthy House, built about 1728 and located next to the First Church of Round Hill. The church was a comparatively late addition to the village, its congregation dating only to the 1820s and the building to 1828; the adjacent cemetery was formally established in 1826. The oldest civic building in the village is a former district schoolhouse, built by 1750 and converted to residential use by incorporation into the house now standing just south of John Street on Round Hill Road. and As the 19th century progressed, the area continued to be mainly agricultural, but by the early 20th century, expanding suburban development transformed the area, as farms were converted into country estates or subdivided for residential construction. The church was at first less important to many newcomers, but its closure in the early 1900s prompted a push for its preservation, and it soon reopened as a non-denominational community church. It and the other older buildings in the area were given Colonial Revival makeovers, in some instances stripping away Victorian alterations.

It ran westwards from Llanyblodwel in Shropshire, about 5 miles or 8 km south- west of Oswestry. It crossed the Wales‚ÄìEngland border and continued up the Tanat valley, terminating at Llangynog in Powys. It opened in 1904, providing access to a fairly remote area, and transport facilities for slate production and agriculture. Its promoters were unable to raise the capital to construct the line, but a number of government grants and considerable generosity by the Cambrian Railways company enabled the building of the line. The company was always in debt and in 1921 was obliged to sell the line to the Cambrian Railways. Rural passenger use collapsed and the railway closed to passengers in 1951, and completely in 1964. A new Tanat Valley Light Railway Company was established, and in 2009 opened a heritage railway centre at Nantmawr, close to the earlier Tanat Valley line. HistoryProposals= The Tanat Valley Light Railway systemThere were many populous villages in the area between the Great Western Railway route through Llangollen, to the north and the Cambrian Railways line through Welshpool to the south. The Berwyn and Aran mountains (with steep gradients and sparse population) together formed a barrier for a through railway line westwards towards the coast. Slate quarrying and agriculture were the areas dominant industries, and both suffered in the mid 19th century from transport difficulties. Several schemes were put forward over the years, but they failed due to lack of interest from subscribers. One ambitious scheme was to extend the West Midland Railway through the region, passing through Montgomery and Bala, penetrating the Berwyns by a long tunnel. If this scheme had been successful, it would perhaps have given the Great Western Railway a trunk line to Holyhead; as it was, the Chester and Holyhead Railway was adopted instead. In 1866 the Potteries, Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway opened from Shrewsbury to the quarries and Nantmawr. That railway was intended to continue through the Tanat Valley to Porthmadog, but it failed to raise the necessary capital.T. R. Perkins and F. E. Fox-Davies, The Tanat Valley Light Railway, in the Railway Magazine, May 1904 In 1882 an Oswestry and Llangynog Railway had been authorised by Act of Parliament, but it failed to raise the necessary capital and was formally abandoned in 1889.E. F. Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 =A definite scheme= The Light Railways Act was passed in 1896 to enable the construction of low-cost railways. This encouraged renewed consideration of a railway in the Tanat Valley, and two alternative schemes were developed. One was for a narrow gauge line from the Llanfyllin terminus of the Cambrian Railways branch. The other was for a standard gauge line from Porthywaen, four miles south of Oswestry. After deliberation, the latter was adopted.C. P. Gasquoine, The Story of the Cambrian: Biography of a Railway, Woodhall, Minshall, Thomas and Co., Oswestry, 1922 The Cambrian Railways agreed to work the line for 60% of gross receipts, and a Treasury grant of ¬£22,000 was agreed, as well as an interest-free loan of ¬£6,000. Financial assistance was also made available from local councils; the share capital of the Company was ¬£15,000. The General Manager of the Cambrian Railways, Mr C. S. Denniss, estimated the capital cost of the line at ¬£46,000. Receipts would be ¬£2,950 per annum. After interest and fixed charges, this would enable a dividend of 4% to be paid. \\"The margin is admittedly small\\". The same newspaper report asserted different figures provided by the Town Clerk of Oswestry, Mr J. Parry-Jones. The total capital of the Company was to be ¬£65,500. Local authorities had promised ¬£18,500 in loans or share subscriptions; ¬£18,000 had been promised as a free grant (though with conditions) by the Treasury; ¬£20,000 had been promised by the Trustees of the Llangedwyn Estate, probably as a share subscription; ¬£1,500 in shares by the Earl of Powis, and about ¬£4,000 by other local investors. \\"The company's borrowing powers are ¬£12,000, so that towards the ¬£65,500 capital required, they are sure of over ¬£55,900.\\"Wrexham Advertiser: 16 September 1899 On this extremely shaky basis the company was founded. Cambrian Railways train on Tanat Valley Light Railway in 1904 The Light Railway Order was granted on 12 September 1899,Peter E. Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 11: North and Mid Wales, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1980, although modifying Orders were needed in 1904 and 1908 to assist in raising capital. J. Strachan of Cardiff was selected as the contractor: he had been the contractor for the construction of the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway. The first sod was cut at Porthywaen on 12 September 1899 by the Countess of Powis, but construction did not start until July 1901. During the construction period, Strachan arranged to convey passengers free of charge on market days over part of the line. Some goods traffic probably also passed at this time. Contemporary travellers reported: \\"The little six-wheeled engine ... was spinning along a quite a rate, considering its small wheel diameter; the carriage was a four-wheeled one, painted a dull red, and probably used at other times to convey the navvies to and from their work.\\" The line was inspected by the Board of Trade Inspecting Officer on 21 December 1903; the line was formally opened on 5 January 1904, and the public passenger service started the following day. When in 1906 Tyer and Company claimed ¬£2,480 for signalling and lighting equipment supplied for the line, the Tanat Valley Company claimed that they had only ordered the apparatus \\"on behalf of the Cambrian Railways\\".Lancashire Evening Post, 8 February 1906 =Description of the line= Perkins and Fox-Davies described the line in 1905. Llanrhaiadr Mochnant station, with a railway enthusiasts' special train in 1958 The passenger trains ran from Oswestry, southwards over the Cambrian Railways line as far as Llynclys, then turning west on the Cambrian Railways Porthywaen branch, leaving that at Porthywaen passenger station, a very small building, and now entering on the Tanat Valley line itself. The track was of much lighter construction now, consisting of Vignoles pattern (flat-bottom) rails dogged direct to the sleepers. The Nantmawr branch of the Cambrian Railways converged from the north. The first TVR station was Blodwel Junction, a single platform station. Blodwel station had been opened in 1866, the terminus of the Potteries line, and known then as Llanyblodwel, part of the mineral branch crossing the path of the TVR. A road crosses the railway by a bridge at Blodwel; this is the only place where there is a bridge crossing of a road.The Welsh spelling Blodwel is taken from the account of Perkins and Fox-Davies; however the official station names used in Bradshaw timetables anglicised this to Blodwell and Llanyblodwell. The next station stop was at Llanyblodwel; a short distance after the station the train stopped for the engine to take water. Glanyrafon was next geographically, but was not yet open when Perkins and Fox-Davies visited, and it was not referred to by them. This section was followed by a crossing into Wales, climbing at 1 in 64. Llansilin Road is the next station, serving Penybont. Llangedwyn station is next, where there was provision for crossing trains on the single line, followed by the small station of Pentrefelin, and then Llanrhaiadr Mochnant, also built as a passing station. A reservoir for Liverpool Corporation Waterworks was built at a location five miles away, and the railway was used for importing some construction materials. The line continues, calling at Pedair Ffordd and terminates at Llangynog. The journey time from Oswestry was 70 to 75 minutes. The gradients on the line generally rose to Llangynog. It fell with a short section at 1 in 72 to Blodwel Junction, and then rose with a half mile at 1 in 64 but generally more moderate gradients all the way to the terminus. Porthywaen was at 132 feet above Ordnance Datum and Llangynog at 320 feet. =Operations= Baughan says that passenger carriages ran with the mineral trains from 1904, but this ended on the first day of 1917. Mineral revenue was about twenty times the value of passenger receipts, and the latter declined further in the 1920s and 1930s as reliable road transport was developed. Glanyrafon station opened soon after the opening of the line.According to Baughan. Cobb gives 1928 as the date of opening, but this must be wrong as the stop appears in the 1922 Bradshaw.Col. M. H. Cobb, The Railways of Great Britain‚ÄîA Historical Atlas, Ian Allan Publishing Limited, Shepperton, 2003, The passenger train service in 1922 consisted of three trains each way between Oswestry and Llangynog, with an extra train on the first Wednesday of the month. The Glanyrafon stop was by request only.Bradshaw's July 1922 Railway Guide, Guild Publishing, London, 1985 In July 1938 the service was more complicated: successive trains ran from Oswestry to Llangynog respectively on Wednesdays; daily except Wednesday and Sunday; Monday, Tuesday and Friday; Wednesday Thursday and Saturday; daily except Saturday and Sunday; on Saturday only; and on the first Wednesday of every month, but also on 30 July. The return service was a little simpler, running respectively on Wednesday; weekdays only; weekdays only; Monday to Friday; and Saturdays only. By this time the Glanyrafon stop had become definite.Bradshaws July 1938 Railway Guide, David and Charles Reprints, Newton Abbot, 1969, 0 7153 4686 5 While railways had an inherent advantage in transporting heavy minerals, the line's viability was dependent on the commercial success of local quarries, and when this declined the finances of the line became irretrievable. =Absorbed by the Cambrian Railways= Opening its line in 1904, the Tanat Valley Light Railway Company was in the hands of the receiver continuously from that year.,Preamble to the Cambrian Railways (Tanat Valley Light Railway Transfer) Order, 1921 as its income did not enable it to pay the interest on loans. The Cambrian Railways subsidised it, but by 1921 it was obvious that improvements to the track and bridges were required, and this was beyond the financial resources of the bankrupt company. Takeover by the Cambrian was the only way out, and this was authorised by Order of the Light Railway Commissioners.Cambrian Railways (Tanat Valley Light Railway Transfer) Order, 1921 The Cambrian Railways were themselves taken over by the Great Western Railway the following year. =Closure= Passenger services were discontinued on 15 January 1951. The line west of Llanrhaiadr was closed completely in July 1952, a residual goods service continuing as far as that point for the time being. The line closed completely in December 1960.

Expansions Tanat Valley Light Railway currently have right of passage to run from Nantmawr to Blodwell Junction around the same time that the Cambrian Heritage Railways complete expansion of their Gobowen to Llynclys line via Oswestry. From there north, they plan to reinstate part of the former Tanat Valley Light Railway from Blodwell Junction to Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant as the trackbed is heavily intact and the locals are willing allow them to re-run into the Tanat Valley. North to Llangynog is mostly impassible due to housing at Penybontfawr station site and Llangynog now being a caravan site. This is a long term ambition of the companies. For now, they are focused on reaching Blodwell Junction. NotesReferencesFurther reading * Wilfred J. Wren, The Tanat Valley Railway, Oakwood Press, Blandford, 1979, * Mike E. M.

It preserves a portion of the modern neighborhood and former borough of Southport, Connecticut. Since the British burnt almost all of Southport's structures in 1779, there is only one home built prior to that date, the Meeker House at 824 Harbor Road, which survives. Description The area of the district is bounded on the north by the Metro-North railroad tracks, on the south by the Mill River and Southport Harbor, on the west by Old South Road, and on the east by Rose Hill Road. It includes additional properties on both sides of Old South Road and Rose Hill Road, but excludes the commercial and industrial properties along Pequot Avenue inside the so- defined area. This is about a quarter of the former borough area of Southport, which ran from Mill River to Sasco Creek, and from the Southport Harbor to Mill Hill. A local commission enforces preservation rules in the district (and also in two other historic districts in the town of Fairfield). Alterations to properties in the district have to be approved. A case where a Greek Revival mansion owner placed a large sculpture on the grounds went all the way to the U.S. supreme court in 2007. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the commission, that the sculpture qualified as a structure and required commission approval. It was the Historic District Commission of Fairfield. More here. The 80 foot, six ton sculpture by German artist Anselm Kiefer, titled \\"Narrow as the Vessels\\", was donated to a museum, and the owner put even more striking (although lighter) sculptures on the lawn instead. In 1970, the NRHP nomination for the district argued it was \\"significant because it has been the center of trade and commerce in Fairfield and because its history is typical of the development of commercial life in many New England ports in the fifty years following the revolutionary war. The architecture of the district consists primarily of buildings constructed after 1779 when the British virtually destroyed Fairfield. It is a valuable concentration of Greek Revival and Victorian structures which were for the most part the homes of substantial men whose wealth came from their involvement in commerce, banking, and shipping.\\" and It includes more than 150 contributing buildings.

Early history Maximiano Errazuriz was born in Santiago, in 1832, the son of Francisco Javier de Err√°zuriz y Aldunate and of his second wife, Rosario Fern√°ndez de Valdivieso y Za√±artu (sister to Archbishop Rafael Valent√≠n Valdivieso). Maximiano Errazuriz studied in Santiago and later settled in Valpara√≠so, Chile, which at the time was one of the main ports of Chile and South America. There he met his future wife, Amalia Urmeneta Quiroga, daughter of , who was the wealthiest man in the country. Maximiano and Amalia were married in 1855, when she was 18 and he was 22 years old. Soon after the marriage, Maximiano Errazuriz entered into a partnership with his father-in-law to form a copper-producing company. Copper is one of Chile's most important natural resources, and at one time, their company accounted for one third of the world's total copper production. A year later, in 1856, Maximiano Errazuriz formed the Santiago Gas Company (), a company which was responsible for establishing street lighting in the capital city of Santiago. A few years later, the couple moved to Guayac√°n, in the northern part of the country. There, Maximiano managed the mining company's production and business operations. But the move to Guayac√°n proved tragic. While pregnant with her fourth child, health problems forced Amalia to return to Santiago and live with her mother-in-law. She never recovered completely after the birth of their son Rafael. Amalia died in 1861, at the young age of 24. After Amalia's death, Maximiano Errazuriz placed his children under the care of his mother and moved from the North back to Valpara√≠so to be near them and still manage his business. His family was concerned about his grief for his wife. To help him, they encouraged Maximiano to embark on a yearlong journey across Europe, where he was able to reinvigorate his interest in history and the arts. Public office Maximiano Errazuriz participated actively in Chile's public life. As a young man of 25, he served for the first time in the Chamber of Deputies. He was elected representative for three periods and subsequently Senator of the Republic for nine years. He also participated actively as a representative of the Chilean government on diplomatic tasks in the United States and in the United Kingdom. On one occasion, he showed his undying commitment to his country by backing Chilean government dealings with his own personal finances. Winemaking activities In 1870, again following the example of his father-in-law, he planted a vineyard on land he bought in Panquehue, a small town located North of Santiago in the Aconcagua Valley. Maximiano Errazuriz planted a total of 300 hectares in Panquehue. Later, his son Rafael increased the plantings to 700 hectares, with the Errazuriz vineyards becoming - based on the information of the time - the world's largest vineyard in the hands of a single owner. Later life In 1871, Maximiano Errazuriz met Carmen Valdes, daughter of the Governor of Valpara√≠so, Chile, whom he married. Shortly thereafter, he began construction of a large house in Panquehue. A beautiful park designed by French landscapers surrounded the house. This was to become the residence of the new couple. However, fate intervened. The candidates running for office for the presidential election of 1871 were very close to him: his older half-brother Federico Err√°zuriz Za√±artu and his father-in-law Jos√© Tom√°s Urmeneta. He did not want his strong political influence to be used to affect the outcome of the election. To avoid being forced to take sides, he decided to leave the country. He traveled to Paris with his new wife and children. In the course of their subsequent return, Carmen became severely ill with yellow fever. She survived the trip only to die in Chile, close to her family. Maximiano Errazuriz continued his activities and concentrated in his children's education. He decided to build a new house in Santiago, where he moved to distance himself from painful memories. This building, presently the Brazilian Embassy, is one of the most beautiful architectural designs in the capital city. After the death of his former father-in-law and partner Jos√© Tom√°s Urmeneta in 1878, Maximiano Errazuriz formed a new partnership with his children and began a gradual retreat from the world of business, diplomacy and politics. In 1883, with his children already married, he settled permanently at his vineyard in Panquehue, selling his house in Santiago. He decided to live in the property's administration house, and never used the mansion he had built to share with his second wife. At 48, he completely transformed his life and became devoted to prayer and to aiding the poor. He lived austerely in the peacefulness of Panquehue, building houses for his workers, founding a school and a church. He also donated a significant portion of his art collection to charitable institutions. Maximiano Errazuriz died in 1890, at the age of 58.

Description and history The area that is now downtown Torrington developed in the 18th century, as a major junction point of the north-south Waterbury Turnpike, connecting Waterbury in the south to Winchester in the north, with the Canton Turnpike, running east to Canton. These streets, now Main Street, South Main Street, and East Main Street, are still the major roads in the area. A mill was established on the Naugatuck River in 1813, and the area experienced more rapid growth after the railroad arrived in 1849. By 1880 the Central Square area was clearly established as the heart of the downtown area. The area declined economically in the 1920s, and the downtown area south of the river was subjected to urban renewal activities later in the 20th century. and Warner Theatre The historic district is a roughly triangular area centered on the junction of Main Street and East Main Street just north of the Naugatuck River. It extends northward along those roads, to Alvord and Willow Streets, and extends south, across the river, to include Coe Memorial Park and a few adjacent buildings.

It is centered at the junction of United States Route 7 with Cobble Road and Studio Hill Road. The area was supplanted by the current town center in the 1840s. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The town of Kent was established in 1738, with the Connecticut Colony auctioning off land in this area late in that year. Settlers soon arrived, and the Flanders area became the town's main settlement. The oldest deeded house is The Daniel Comstock Homestead c. 1739, built during the settling of Kent. The area remained of civic importance until the 1840s, when a railroad stop was established further south. This resulted in the migration of economic and civic functions to that area, which is where the present town center is. Since then, the Flanders area has been a quiet rural residential village. The historic district is centered at the junction of US 7 with Cobble Road and Studio Hill Road, and covers about . It includes twelve major buildings, of which five are large Federal style houses, three are older colonial-era buildings, and two later Greek Revival structures. All of these building exhibit vernacular interpretations of those styles, with simplified decorative elements.

In 1960, both the original grandstand and hillside seating were eliminated for the construction of Villiger (now Post) Building/Bluett Theater. That construction necessitated raising the field's level some five feet above its earlier location. In 1990, the facility's usage was greatly expanded with the installation of artificial turf.

It encompasses most of the historic village of Hotchkissville, which is centered at the junction of Washington and Weekeepeemee Roads. The village began as a dispersed rural agricultural community, but developed in the 19th century with the arrival of industry, primarily the manufacture of textiles. Despite this, the village has retained a significantly rural character, and includes a broad cross-section of 18th- and 19th-century architectural styles. Notable residents include the Wols family. and Description and history The town of Woodbury was established in the late 17th century. The Hotchkissville area was initially agricultural, and significant development did not begin until the Washington Turnpike, now Washington Road, opened in 1803. Early industrial activity on the Weekeepeemee River consisted of sawmills and gristmills, some operated by owners whose houses still stand in the district. Josiah Hotchkiss converted one of these sawmills into a textile mill in 1814. The Hotchkiss manufacturing enterprise grew through the first half of the 19th century, building worker house and a mill office, and expanding by the acquisition of other water privileges on the river. Their empire collapsed in the Panic of 1857. The mill properties were taken over by the Dawson family, and other industrial operations began in the second half of the 19th century. Businesses in the area were ultimately harmed and failed by the lack of adequate railroad connections. The historic district is essentially linear in shape, extending along both sides of the Weekeepeemee River, with Washington Road (Connecticut Route 47) the main route on the east side, and Westwood Road on the west side. It is bounded in the south by Jack's Bridge Road, and the north by Paper Mill Road and an end to dense development on Weekeepeemee Road. Only remnants of the village's industrial past survive, its major mill complex having burned in 1920. Most of the buildings in the district are of either Federal or Greek Revival style, or have relatively modest later Victorian stylistic elements.

They are most commonly found in computer simulations, e.g. for computational fluid dynamics in the context of scientific and engineering applications. Other notable examples include solving partial differential equations, the Jacobi kernel, the Gauss‚ÄìSeidel method, image processing and cellular automata. Fey, Dietmar et al. (2010) Grid-Computing: Eine Basistechnologie f√ºr Computational Science. Page 439. Publisher: Springer. The regular structure of the arrays sets stencil techniques apart from other modeling methods such as the Finite element method. Most finite difference codes which operate on regular grids can be formulated as ISLs. Definition ISLs perform a sequence of sweeps (called timesteps) through a given array. Generally this is a 2- or 3-dimensional regular grid. The elements of the arrays are often referred to as cells. In each timestep, all array elements are updated. Using neighboring array elements in a fixed pattern (the stencil), each cell's new value is computed. In most cases boundary values are left unchanged, but in some cases (e.g. LBM codes) those need to be adjusted during the computation as well. Since the stencil is the same for each element, the pattern of data accesses is repeated. Yang, Laurence T.; Guo, Minyi. (August 12, 2005) High-Performance Computing : Paradigm and Infrastructure. Page 221. Publisher: Wiley-Interscience. More formally, we may define ISLs as a 5-tuple (I, S, S_0, s, T) with the following meaning: * I = \\\\prod_{i=1}^k [0, \\\\ldots, n_i] is the index set. It defines the topology of the array. * S is the (not necessarily finite) set of states, one of which each cell may take on on any given timestep. * S_0\\\\colon \\\\Z^k \\\\to S defines the initial state of the system at time 0. * s \\\\in \\\\prod_{i=1}^l \\\\Z^k is the stencil itself and describes the actual shape of the neighborhood. There are l elements in the stencil. * T\\\\colon S^l \\\\to S is the transition function which is used to determine a cell's new state, depending on its neighbors. Since I is a k-dimensional integer interval, the array will always have the topology of a finite regular grid. The array is also called simulation space and individual cells are identified by their index c \\\\in I. The stencil is an ordered set of l relative coordinates. We can now obtain for each cell c the tuple of its neighbors indices I_c : I_c = \\\\\\\\{j \\\\mid \\\\exists x \\\\in s: j = c + x\\\\\\\\} \\\\, Their states are given by mapping the tuple I_c to the corresponding tuple of states N_i(c), where N_i\\\\colon I \\\\to S^l is defined as follows: : N_i(c) = (s_1, \\\\ldots, s_l) \\\\text{ with } s_j = S_i(I_c(j)) \\\\, This is all we need to define the system's state for the following time steps S_{i+1}\\\\colon \\\\Z^k \\\\to S with i \\\\in \\\\N: : S_{i+1}(c) = \\\\begin{cases}T(N_i(c)), & c \\\\in I S_i(c), & c \\\\in \\\\Z^k \\\\setminus I \\\\end{cases} Note that S_i is defined on \\\\Z^k and not just on I since the boundary conditions need to be set, too. Sometimes the elements of I_c may be defined by a vector addition modulo the simulation space's dimension to realize toroidal topologies: : I_c = \\\\\\\\{j \\\\mid \\\\exists x \\\\in s: j = ((c + x) \\\\mod(n_1, \\\\ldots, n_k))\\\\\\\\} This may be useful for implementing periodic boundary conditions, which simplifies certain physical models. = Example: 2D Jacobi iteration = Data dependencies of a selected cell in the 2D array. To illustrate the formal definition, we'll have a look at how a two dimensional Jacobi iteration can be defined. The update function computes the arithmetic mean of a cell's four neighbors. In this case we set off with an initial solution of 0. The left and right boundary are fixed at 1, while the upper and lower boundaries are set to 0. After a sufficient number of iterations, the system converges against a saddle-shape. : \\\\begin{align} I & = [0, \\\\ldots, 99]^2  S & = \\\\R  S_0 &: \\\\Z^2 \\\\to \\\\R  S_0((x, y)) & = \\\\begin{cases} 1, & x < 0  0, & 0 \\\\le x < 100  1, & x \\\\ge 100 \\\\end{cases} s & = ((0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1))  T &\\\\colon \\\\R^4 \\\\to \\\\R  T((x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)) & = 0.25 \\\\cdot (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4) \\\\end{align} Stencils The shape of the neighborhood used during the updates depends on the application itself. The most common stencils are the 2D or 3D versions of the von Neumann neighborhood and Moore neighborhood. The example above uses a 2D von Neumann stencil while LBM codes generally use its 3D variant. Conway's Game of Life uses the 2D Moore neighborhood. That said, other stencils such as a 25-point stencil for seismic wave propagation Micikevicius, Paulius et al. (2009) 3D finite difference computation on GPUs using CUDA Proceedings of 2nd Workshop on General Purpose Processing on Graphics Processing Units can be found, too. Implementation issues Many simulation codes may be formulated naturally as ISLs. Since computing time and memory consumption grow linearly with the number of array elements, parallel implementations of ISLs are of paramount importance to research.Datta, Kaushik (2009) Auto-tuning Stencil Codes for Cache-Based Multicore Platforms , Ph.D. Thesis This is challenging since the computations are tightly coupled (because of the cell updates depending on neighboring cells) and most ISLs are memory bound (i.e. the ratio of memory accesses to calculations is high). Wellein, G et al. (2009) Efficient temporal blocking for stencil computations by multicore-aware wavefront parallelization, 33rd Annual IEEE International Computer Software and Applications Conference, COMPSAC 2009 Virtually all current parallel architectures have been explored for executing ISLs efficiently; Datta, Kaushik et al.

Sch√§fer, Andreas and Fey, Dietmar (2011) High Performance Stencil Code Algorithms for GPGPUs, Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Science, ICCS 2011 Libraries Due to both the importance of ISLs to computer simulations and their high computational requirements, there are a number of efforts which aim at creating reusable libraries to support scientists in performing stencil-based computations. The libraries are mostly concerned with the parallelization, but may also tackle other challenges, such as IO, steering and checkpointing. They may be classified by their API. =Patch-based libraries= This is a traditional design. The library manages a set of n-dimensional scalar arrays, which the user program may access to perform updates. The library handles the synchronization of the boundaries (dubbed ghost zone or halo). The advantage of this interface is that the user program may loop over the arrays, which makes it easy to integrate legacy code S. Donath, J. G√∂tz, C. Feichtinger, K. Iglberger and U. R√ºde (2010) waLBerla: Optimization for Itanium-based Systems with Thousands of Processors, High Performance Computing in Science and Engineering, Garching/Munich 2009 . The disadvantage is that the library can not handle cache blocking (as this has to be done within the loops Nguyen, Anthony et al. (2010) 3.5-D Blocking Optimization for Stencil Computations on Modern CPUs and GPUs, SC '10 Proceedings of the 2010 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis ) or wrapping of the API-calls for accelerators (e.g. via CUDA or OpenCL). Implementations include Cactus, a physics problem solving environment, and waLBerla. =Cell-based libraries= These libraries move the interface to updating single simulation cells: only the current cell and its neighbors are exposed, e.g. via getter/setter methods. The advantage of this approach is that the library can control tightly which cells are updated in which order, which is useful not only to implement cache blocking, but also to run the same code on multi-cores and GPUs. Naoya Maruyama, Tatsuo Nomura, Kento Sato, and Satoshi Matsuoka (2011) Physis: An Implicitly Parallel Programming Model for Stencil Computations on Large-Scale GPU-Accelerated Supercomputers, SC '11 Proceedings of the 2011 ACM/IEEE International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis This approach requires the user to recompile the source code together with the library. Otherwise a function call for every cell update would be required, which would seriously impair performance. This is only feasible with techniques such as class templates or metaprogramming, which is also the reason why this design is only found in newer libraries. Examples are Physis and LibGeoDecomp.

Located at a bend in the West Branch of the Farmington River southeast of New Hartford center, it is a well-preserved example of a rural industrial village. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history The town of New Hartford was settled in the 18th century, but its principal villages developed in the 19th century around water sources that powered its industries. Pine Meadow was one of these villages, whose origins lie in the damming of the West Branch Farmington River in 1806 by Roger Sheldon. Sheldon dug a power canal across the bend in the river that forms the village's north and east bounds, that was located between what are now Wickett and Main streets. Main Street, now U.S. Route 44, was then the Albany Turnpike, and Wickett Street is named for the control structures on the canal that provided water to the various industries powered by the dam. Industrial uses included a brass foundry, textile mill, and the woodworking factory of the Chapin family, which became one of the village's dominant businesses. Most of the industrial facilities of the village have been lost, leaving a combination of worker housing and higher-quality homes of business managers and owners. The historic district is bounded on the north and east by the West Branch Farmington River, and on the southwest by a rising ridge that roughly parallels Main Street, with a former railroad right-of-way just above its base. Because the village was at its height in the mid-19th century, most of the distinguished architecture in the village is either Greek Revival or Italianate. The most prominent house in the district is the Philip Chapin House, one of New Hartford's finest examples of Italianate architecture; it was built by one of the business owners. There are many examples of housing built for workers, ranging from small single-family houses to multi-story tenements. A focal point of the village is the triangular green formed by Main Street and Church Street, where the Chapin House and St. John's Episcopal Church, a fine example of Gothic Revival architecture, stand side by side.

It encompasses most of the historic 19th century industrial village of Riverton, whose mills were powered by the waters of the Still River and the East Branch Farmington River, which is located in the far northwestern corner of the town. Description Notable sites in Riverton include the post office, the Riverton General store, Sweetpea's Restaurant, Still River Antiques, Greenwood Glass Blowing Studio and Gallery (located in the former Union Church), and the Old Riverton Inn (separately listed on the National Register). Two major points of interest in Riverton are the Hitchcock Factory and the Sweet Shop, both of which closed down in the spring of 2006. The Hitchcock Chair Co. was reopened in Sept. 2011 and has a retail store in the village once again. Riverton is also the site of the annual Riverton Fair, which takes place in early October of each year. The Riverton Fair is the last fair of the year in Connecticut. History The town of Barkhamsted was first settled in the mid-18th century, mainly with small dispersed settlements along the rivers and ridges. The first house documented in what is now Riverton was built in 1789 by William Moore, Sr., and a bridge spanning the East Branch Farmington River was built in 1790. The bridge, the only crossing for miles in either direction, spurred growth of the village. The Old Riverton Inn was built in 1811, and still stands directly facing the bridge's eastern end. The village developed in the 19th century as a small industrial center, powered mainly by the chair manufactory of Lambert Hitchcock.

It is a small community that grew up around an iron mining and refining operation during the late 19th century, the first industry in Sharon. Many of the buildings within date from that era. Some are intact examples of their respective architectural styles. There are remains of the original industrial facilities, and three iron bridges. and The area was designated a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Geography The district is an irregularly shaped area of mostly following the three roads whose intersection defines it in the area between Webutuck and Indian Lake creeks. Other than the area with the former lime kiln, the large town complex with garage, park and ballfields to the immediate west is not included. Its north and south boundaries are at the point where development, or at least houses from the period of significance, ends along the roads in those directions. It is a mostly level residential area with mature, tall trees remaining from the forests that preceded its agricultural use. The intersection is located roughly one mile (1.6 km) north of state highway CT 343, a thousand feet (300 m) east of the New York state line. The nearest large settlements are Amenia, New York, to the west and downtown Sharon to the east. The large Coleman Station Historic District in North East, New York, is a short distance to the northwest. Most of its several dozen contributing properties are 19th-century houses with the occasional outbuilding such as a barn. The oldest are in the Federal style and date to ca. 1825; the newest were built in the early 20th century. Non-contributing properties are mostly the more modern houses that have been built, some in the center of the district, and a state Department of Transportation sandpit. The land on which the mill, lime kiln and other remaining industrial facilities once stood is also included as a contributing property. History Sharon's economy had been exclusively agricultural throughout the colonial era and after independence. Gristmills built on its creeks were precursors to industrialization, and in 1825 heavy industry came to Sharon with the construction of the first iron furnace. The valley, with both ideal water power from the two creeks, abundant forest for the making of charcoal, good sand, limestone in the nearby hills and ore near Indian Lake to the north, was an ideal site. The Sharon Valley Iron Company's (SVI) cold blast furnace employed 12 at first, enough to make it the town's largest employer by the 1850 census. Over time they built six houses for their workers, a barn, and the Carpenter Gothic office at the center of the district, today the Valley Tavern. They also likely ran the lime kiln as a sideline to their main business. A few years after SVI established its furnace, Asahel Hotchkiss began his malleable iron works behind his house at 53 Sharon Valley Road. He formed partnerships with other local entrepreneurs, and by 1850 he, too, was a major local employer, with that year's census counting nine workers and valuing his annual production at $25,000 ($ in contemporary dollars). His son Andrew invented the exploding artillery shell, a weapon that proved useful to the Union Army in the American Civil War. By the time the conflict began the Hotchkisses had moved to a new plant at the junction of Indian Lake Creek and Sharon Valley Road. The 1860 census records Hotchkiss & Sons along with the closely related Jewett Manufacturing Company employing 87. SVI went to hot blast production in 1863. After the war Hotchkiss moved to Bridgeport. The Jewett operations remained in the valley, and employed 48 in 1879. Demand declined late in the century. SVI sold out to Barnum & Morehouse in 1898, and the lime kiln and furnace shut down around two years later.

It encompasses a well- preserved early 19th-century industrial village, with twenty historically significant properties in the village, most of which lie on Connecticut Route 4 between Beach Street and Thompson Road. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history The village of West Goshen, located west of the village center of Goshen on the Sharon Turnpike (Connecticut Route 4), was isolated and not developed until that road was built about 1770. The area was recognized for the potential of its water power earlier, with a gristmill and sawmill standing on the banks of local waterways in the 1740s. More development took place with the construction of a woolen mill in 1810, intended to process the output of Goshen's large sheep population. This prompted the construction of worker housing for the mill employees, and a small village quickly arose. The West Goshen Store, built in 1814, is one of the products of this period of growth. The village declined around the time of the American Civil War, as water power began to be phased out for industrial works. The historic district is about in size, extending along Route 4 between Beach Street and Thompson Road. It is roughly bisected by a branch of the Marshepaug River, where its mill resources (none of which have survived in more than archaeological form) survive. Most of this area's buildings are residential and were built in the early decades of the 19th century, with Federal or Greek Revival style. There are some buildings that are older and some that date to the 1880s. Non-residential buildings include the former West Goshen Store (330 Rt. 4) and a former carding mill at 331 Rt. 4, built in 1818.

However, it was shelved after a merger between McKagan's parent label Polygram and Universal, and McKagan lost the rights to release it. Overview The album was recorded through 1998 in Duff McKagan's home studio with all the instruments and vocals on the album provided by McKagan himself, with the addition of guests like Mike Bordin, Michael Barragan, Abe Laboriel, Jr and ex-Guns N' Roses members Slash and Izzy Stradlin. Beautiful Disease included new versions of the songs \\"Seattlehead\\" and \\"Mezz\\" that were previously featured on releases of Duff McKagan's previous bands, Neurotic Outsiders and 10 Minute Warning respectively. The album was supposed to be released on Duff McKagan's birthday February 5, 1999. The promotional campaign for the album was started by Geffen Records with promo copies being distributed. During the same time a merger between Polygram and Universal occurred and Geffen was merged with A&M; Records into Interscope and Mckagan's album was among others that was shelved. Nevertheless, Duff McKagan went on tour in support of the album putting up a band with Dez Cadena of Black Flag, Taz Bentley of the Burden Brothers and Michael Barragan of Plexi. During the tour McKagan came up with the idea to release a live album that would include the unreleased material. This resulted in Loaded's Episode 1999: Live live album that featured six songs from Beautiful Disease: \\"Seattlehead\\", \\"Superman\\", \\"Shinin' Down\\", \\"Missing You\\", \\"Then And Now\\" and \\"Mezz\\".

Trivially perfect graphs were first studied by but were named by ; Golumbic writes that \\"the name was chosen since it is trivial to show that such a graph is perfect.\\" Trivially perfect graphs are also known as comparability graphs of trees,; . arborescent comparability graphs,. and quasi-threshold graphs.. Equivalent characterizations Trivially perfect graphs have several other equivalent characterizations: *They are the comparability graphs of order-theoretic trees. That is, let T be a partial order such that for each t ‚àà T, the set {s ‚àà T : s < t} is well-ordered by the relation <, and also T possesses a minimum element r. Then the comparability graph of T is trivially perfect, and every trivially perfect graph can be formed in this way., theorem 6.6.1, p. 99; , corollary 4. *They are the graphs that do not have a P4 path graph or a C4 cycle graph as induced subgraphs., theorem 6.6.1, p. 99; , theorem 2. and proved this for comparability graphs of rooted forests. *They are the graphs in which every connected induced subgraph contains a universal vertex. *They are the graphs that can be represented as the interval graphs for a set of nested intervals. A set of intervals is nested if, for every two intervals in the set, either the two are disjoint or one contains the other., p. 51. *They are the graphs that are both chordal and cographs. This follows from the characterization of chordal graphs as the graphs without induced cycles of length greater than three, and of cographs as the graphs without induced paths on four vertices (P4). *They are the graphs that are both cographs and interval graphs., p. 248; , theorem 3. *They are the graphs that can be formed, starting from one-vertex graphs, by two operations: disjoint union of two smaller trivially perfect graphs, and the addition of a new vertex adjacent to all the vertices of a smaller trivially perfect graph.; . These operations correspond, in the underlying forest, to forming a new forest by the disjoint union of two smaller forests and forming a tree by connecting a new root node to the roots of all the trees in a forest. *They are the graphs in which, for every edge uv, the neighborhoods of u and v (including u and v themselves) are nested: one neighborhood must be a subset of the other., theorem 3. *They are the permutation graphs defined from stack-sortable permutations.. *They are the graphs with the property that in each of its induced subgraphs the clique cover number equals the number of maximal cliques. *They are the graphs with the property that in each of its induced subgraphs the clique number equals the pseudo-Grundy number. *They are the graphs with the property that in each of its induced subgraphs the chromatic number equals the pseudo-Grundy number. Related classes of graphs It follows from the equivalent characterizations of trivially perfect graphs that every trivially perfect graph is also a cograph, a chordal graph, a Ptolemaic graph, an interval graph, and a perfect graph. The threshold graphs are exactly the graphs that are both themselves trivially perfect and the complements of trivially perfect graphs (co-trivially perfect graphs)., theorem 6.6.3, p. 100; , corollary 5. Windmill graphs are trivially perfect. Recognition describes a simple linear time algorithm for recognizing trivially perfect graphs, based on lexicographic breadth-first search. Whenever the LexBFS algorithm removes a vertex v from the first set on its queue, the algorithm checks that all remaining neighbors of v belong to the same set; if not, one of the forbidden induced subgraphs can be constructed from v. If this check succeeds for every v, then the graph is trivially perfect. The algorithm can also be modified to test whether a graph is the complement graph of a trivially perfect graph, in linear time. Determining if a general graph is k edge deletions away from a trivially perfect graph is NP- complete, fixed-parameter tractable and can be solved in O(2.45k(m + n)) time.

It is one of the most popular mobile browsers in China and Indonesia, and was the 8th most downloaded mobile app of the 2010‚Äì2019 decade. Originally launched in April 2004 as a J2ME-only application, it is now available on a number of platforms including Android, iOS, BlackBerry OS, Java ME, Symbian, Windows Phone Microsoft Windows. It has been the subject of several security and privacy controversies, and was banned in India on June 29, 2020, shortly after the 2020 China‚ÄìIndia skirmishes.  Functionality  UC Browser is a cross-platform web browser primarily targeted at mobile phones. It is known for its small app size and data compression technology, making it popular in emerging markets where people tend to have mobile phones with more limited device memory and internet bandwidth. In particular, the browser is unique in its use of proxy servers, which run data through UCWeb servers before sending it to the user's device, enabling data compression but also posing privacy risks. Additional features of the browser include cloud acceleration, multi-file format downloading, HTML5 web app and cloud syncing features, and \\"fast download\\", a feature that downloads files in multiple parts simultaneously. = Platforms = UC Browser is available as both an Android app and an iOS app, and is also available on several other older or discontinued mobile operating systems including BlackBerry OS, Symbian, and Windows Phone. While primarily a mobile app, UCWeb also offers a Microsoft Windows desktop version (there is no macOS version). The Android mobile operating system represents the largest user base for the company, which as of 2014 accounted for 300 million of its 500 million users. = Data compression = UC Browser uses proxy servers to compress web pages before sending them to users. This process requires less memory on the user's device and lowers data costs; however, it also poses privacy and security risks as all of the data accessed by the user through UC Browser first runs through a UCWeb server, rather than going directly to the user's device. = UC+: HTML5, WebApp and add-ons = In July 2013, UCWeb announced the UC+ Open Platform. The platform consists of a WebApp store, an add-on platform and an Application Bookmark Platform. It went live with the launch of UC Browser v9.2 for Android. Developers can use a provided SDK to create programs that the browser runs in different scenarios. Users can download and install them from the browser's add-on panel. Examples include sharing to social media, webpage translation, augmented reality, and voice control. The Application Bookmark Platform allows partner websites to put up a QR code on UC Browser for users to scan, which adds the webpage to their bookmarks. This platform was among the first in China. = Download management = The browser supports simultaneous downloads and includes a download manager, including pages for offline reading. It supports pausing and resuming downloads. The current version of the download manager has features designed to solve common problems while downloading, such as an intermittent internet connection and mislabeled files. The download process can continue after the app is closed, and can also automatically resume if the download is interrupted. The download manager sorts downloaded files by type and places them in respective folders. = Cloud system = UCWeb claims that the cloud system used by the browser tends to fetch data from the closest servers available, making the loading process quicker and smoother for users.  Privacy and security  Privacy =  Leaked NSA reports  In May 2015, National Security Agency (NSA) documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden indicated that UC Browser leaks sensitive data like international mobile subscriber identities, international mobile station equipment identities, MSISDN's, Android ID's, MAC addresses, and geolocation and Wi-Fi-related data without any encryption. These leaks were used by intelligence agencies to track users. The documents also revealed that the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) had identified UC Browser as a security weak point. Its widespread use in China, India and Indonesia made it particularly attractive to ASD. The documents revealed that in cooperation with its Five Eyes partners, ASD hacked the UC Browser and infected smartphones with spyware. The ASD declined to comment in relation to the revelations.  Citizen Lab report  In May 2015, Citizen Lab, a laboratory based at the University of Toronto, published a report finding numerous privacy and security issues with both the English language and Chinese language editions of the Android version of UC Browser. The report criticized the transmission of personally identifiable information to various commercial analytics tools and the transmission of user search queries without encryption. They also managed to bypass the encryption of UC Browser, leading them to accuse UCWeb of using non-effective encryption systems to transmit personally identifiable subscriber data, mobile device identifiers, and user geolocation data. In May 2016, Alibaba Group provided Citizen Lab with updated versions of UC Browser in order to verify their security fixes to these issues. The subsequent update published by Citizen Lab indicated that not all of the previously identified data leaks and privacy breaches had been fixed in UC Browser.  India investigation  After the release of the Citizen Lab report, the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Hyderabad, a scientific research unit within India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY), began a technical investigation into the \\"several major privacy and security vulnerabilities that would seriously expose users of UC Browser to surveillance and other privacy violations\\" alleged in the report. C-DAC found that the browser (which is the second-most- used browser in India) had been sending user data to Chinese servers and that it retains control over a user's device DNS even after the browser is deleted. = Security = Research has found that UC Browser is insecure, with many vulnerabilities and privacy issues. In March 2019, analysts at the anti- malware firm Doctor Web publicly disclosed that UC Browser and UC Browser Mini for Android was downloading and installing extra modules from the company's own servers via an unprotected HTTP channel. This exposed browser users to arbitrary remote code execution if an attacker was able to perform a man-in- the-middle attack to deliver malicious module (but no cases of exploitation were publicly disclosed). Furthermore, this violates Google Play policies that forbid Google Play apps from downloading any executable code from any sources outside of Google Play. Researchers contacted both UCWeb Inc. and Google prior to the disclosure, but as of March 26, 2019, neither app was patched and users are still vulnerable to the attack. According to tests on Qualys, a cloud security firm, and High-Tech Bridge, an internet security firm, UC Browser contains Logjam, FREAK, and POODLE vulnerabilities. UC Browser also uses an outdated RC4 cipher cryptography with deprecated SSL 3 or even SSL 2 protocols, which have many security flaws.  Market adoption  As of March 2014, UC Browser has over 500 million users, largely in China, India, and Indonesia, and as of 2016 it has more than 100 million monthly active users. According to the app analytics firm App Annie, UC Browser was the 8th most downloaded mobile app of the 2010‚Äì2019 decade. UC Browser has gained significant popularity in China, India, and Indonesia. In October 2012, UC Browser topped Opera in Google Play's free Android app download category in India for the first time. According to third-party web analytics firm StatCounter, UC Browser surpassed Opera as India's top mobile browser with 32.82 percent of the market share to Opera's 26.91 percent. Google Zeitgeist 2013 showed that the \\"Most Searched Mobile Apps\\" in India were dominated by messaging and browsing apps, with WhatsApp and UC Browser topping the rankings for the most searches on mobile in 2013. The number of users of UC Browser may be significantly affected by the May 2020 recommendation by India's National Security Council following the 2020 China‚ÄìIndia skirmishes that UC Browser and other Chinese-owned apps be blocked due to cyber-security concerns.  History  UC Browser was initially launched in April 2004 as a J2ME-only application. The logo of UC Browser was redesigned in December 2012, from a cartoon squirrel to a more abstract and stylized icon that's more in line with American designs. In May 2013, UCWeb customized its browser for Vodafone's Indian customers. It also announced a partnership with Trend Micro, under which both companies worked to provide mobile web safety assessments in the browser. In August 2013, UC Browser provided distribution channels of companies like AppURL Initiative and partned with distributor Gameloft to sell its products. = Ban in India = On June 29 Monday, 2020, the Government of India banned UC Browser, along with 58 other Chinese apps such as TikTok and WeChat, citing data and privacy issues and claiming that it is a \\"threat to the sovereignty and integrity\\" of the country. Many commentators have suggested that the move was a retaliation to the 2020 China‚ÄìIndia skirmishes between India and China.

It encompasses a late 19th-century historic mill village, including a small commercial center where Connecticut Route 12 and 14 meet, a cluster of architecturally distinguished buildings built by mill owners and managers, and a collection of mill worker housing units. It includes the Plainfield Woolen Company Mill, which is separately listed, as well as archaeological remnants of other mill infrastructure. It also includes Plainfield's old town hall (built 1872) and high school (built 1924). Other architecturally prominent buildings include the c. 1855 Italianate mansion of mill owner Arthur Fenner, and the 1845 Greek Revival Congregational Church. The area that is now Central Village was a typical agricultural area until 1814, when a consortium of locals built a small cotton mill on the banks of the Moosup River. This enterprise gradually expanded, with the owners building housing for the mill workers, creating a small village. In 1845 the Central Manufacturing Company, then the village's largest employer, built a brick mill. The village's growth was encouraged by the arrival of the railroad in 1839, which was run midway between two mill locations. The cotton mills declined in the late 19th century, but its economy was propped up by other industries until the early 20th century, when the Plainfield Woolen Company revived the textile industry, building the principal surviving mill building.

It was directed by Preston Sturges and written by him based on a story by Earl Felton. The film, Sturges' first Technicolor production, was not well received at the time it was released, and was generally conceded to be a disaster - even Betty Grable bad-mouthed it - but its reputation has improved somewhat over time, though it is not considered to be in the same league as the intelligent comedies Sturges made at Paramount Pictures for which he is known.Allmovie Review The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend would turn out to be the last American film on which Sturges would work - although he would receive credit for films that were remakes or adaptations of his earlier films. Sturges directed only one more film in his life, the 1955 French comedy Les carnets du Major Thompson (released in the U.S. as The French, They Are a Funny Race).TCM Notes Plot Hot-headed Winifred \\"Freddie\\" Jones (Betty Grable) is a saloon singer in the Old West who catches her boyfriend, gambler Blackie Jobero (Romero), flirting with another woman and takes a shot at him with the six-shooter she always carries. Unfortunately, she hits a judge (Porter Hall), instead, so her friend Conchita (Olga San Juan) and she take it on the lam. When they get to a tiny hole-in-the-wall town, Freddie and Conchita are mistaken for the new schoolmarm and her Indian maid. They meet the local muckety-mucks, including wealthy Charles Hingelman (Vallee), owner of a valuable gold mine, who starts to romance Freddie.

The film had been scheduled to go into production in September 1947, but was \\"temporarily shelved\\" in October because Fox production head Darryl F. Zanuck was concerned about the high cost of doing a film in Technicolor. While the production was delayed, Sturges made Unfaithfully Yours (1948) as his first film for Fox. An early draft of the screen play, dated 29 December 1947 indicates that Sturges was considering June Haver in the role of Freddie, though Betty Grable had already been announced as starring. In the script, Sturges wrote: > It is my habit, when writing a play, to cast the parts as, in my mind, each > character makes his first appearance. Occasionally, a stranger walks in and > I am uneasy about his looks and the sound of his voice, but usually as he > pauses in the doorway I recognize an old friend whose talents I admire and > about whose fitness for the part I have no doubts. As was usually the case on Sturges' films, the censors at the Hays Office had concerns about the script for The Beautiful Blonde... which had been submitted to them. Joseph Breen, head of the Production Code, warned Fox that it \\"contains entirely too much dialogue and action which concerns itself - in a quite blunt and pointed way - with sex.\\" The office approved a draft script submitted on 23 September 1948. The Beautiful Blonde... was in production from late September to late November 1948, with an additional sequence shot in early January 1949.TCM Overview Whether Sturges or another director worked on the January shoot, which was to change the ending of the film at the insistence of Zanuck, is unclear. The film premiered in Hollywood and New York City on 27 May 1949 and went into general American release in June. It was marketed with the tagline: \\"She had the biggest Six-Shooters in the West!\\"IMDB Taglines The film was budgeted at an estimated $2,260,000 and brought in during its initial American release only about $1,489,000.IMDB Business data The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend was released on video in the U.S. on 25 May 1989.TCM Misc. notes  References  External links   * Category:1949 films Category:1949 romantic comedy films Category:1940s Western (genre) comedy films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Preston Sturges Category:American romantic comedy films Category:Films with screenplays by Preston Sturges Category:Films scored by Cyril J.

Service  stickK users set up a \\"commitment contract\\", a commitment device where they agree to achieve a certain goal, such as losing weight, exercising more, quitting smoking, or conserving energy. They sign a legally binding contract that will send their money to third parties, including either individuals (referred to as \\"Friend or Foe\\") or a number of organizations and charities. If users pick \\"Charity\\" as a recipient of their forfeited money, stickK selects the charity for the user. Users can also pick a specific organization whose views they oppose referred to as \\"anti-charities\\". The site also allows for referees‚Äîpeople selected by the user to help monitor the progress of their contract. When a user submits a report to the website, the referee is asked to confirm the accuracy of the report. Users are also allowed to designate other users and friends. Such people, known as supporters, receive emails about the users' progress.  History  stickK was started by two Yale University professors, Dean Karlan and Ian Ayres. During graduate school at M.I.T., Karlan and a colleague made a wager to lose 40 pounds each, and to referee one another so as to stay on target. Their service draws on their experiences and two principles from behavioral economics, loss aversion and time inconsistency. They recruited Jordan Goldberg, then a student at the Yale School of Management, to build the company. The company was founded in New Haven in 2007 and subsequently moved to New York City. It was initially funded by a $150,000 investment from the three founders, and later raised about $2 million from a pool of investors in two rounds. The web site was launched in the beginning of 2008. Usage of the site is free for individual users, with the initial business plan involving advertising revenues. The company later created non-free B2B products, offering corporations a co-branded version of StickK for the use of their employees or members. In May 2010, stickK.com launched Choose You, where individuals can write commitment contracts and have their friends or family pledge money to the American Cancer Society if the contract is fulfilled. According to Goldberg, users who put money on the line and have a referee tend to do best. 78% of these users achieve their goals, as compared to only 35% who put no money down. Steven Levitt, co-author of Freakonomics, wrote about and approved of the website and its concept. StickK also appears in the [popular press] book More Than Good Intentions, where it is mentioned as an example of a type of commitment device that can be adapted to development programs in microsavings and health. According to Karlan, the company's name comes from 'stick'ing to it, and the second K is the legal shorthand for a contract. It also refers to carrot and stick.

Memoir: Five Years in Heaven In 2015, John released his first memoir, Five Years in Heaven: The Unlikely Friendship That Answered Life‚Äôs Greatest Questions. The book chronicles how at age thirty-one, lost and alone at a crucial crossroads in his life, John found Heaven on earth. On the grounds of a 150-year‚Äìold monastery, he met 87-year-old, artist and cloistered nun Sister Augustine, the wise and humble artist at the convent‚Äôs ceramic shop. Over the next five years, John visited Sister just about every week. Their hundreds of visits became a master class in the meaning of life, love, and starting over, with a lot of laughter along the way. In 2016, Five Years in Heaven was honored with a Christopher Award.https://www.christophers.org/release---awards-2016 Cookbooks A member of the award-winning Straub Brewery family of Pennsylvania, one of the oldest and most historic brewing families in the United States dating back to the 1870s, John called upon his family roots to write The Ultimate Beer Lover's Cookbook. With more than 400 food and drink recipes that all use beer as an ingredient, The Ultimate Beer Lover's Cookbook made history in 2008 as the largest beer cookbook ever published. In 2009, the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards named The Ultimate Beer Lover's Cookbook The Best Beer Book in the United States and The Best Beer Book in the World. That same year, The Beer Lover's Cookbook was released as a smaller paperback adaptation of the original, with just over 300 food and drink recipes. In August 2014, John's cookbook The Ultimate Beer Lover‚Äôs Happy Hour: Over 325 Recipes for Your Favorite Bar Snacks & Beer Cocktails debuted. It features bar bites ‚Äì from Sizzling Sriracha Peanuts to Taproom Tacos to Blitzed Bean Soup ‚Äì and beer cocktails, chuggers, shots, shooters, chasers, punches, floats, and shakes, with nearly 1,000 related pairing suggestions using today‚Äôs most popular craft and seasonal beer styles. John's other cookbooks include The Cheesy Vegan, Grilling Vegan Style, and The Tipsy Vegan. THE SMILE THAT CHANGED THE WORLD (is yours) On June 5, 2016, John's 18-foot long, participatory art piece titled THE SMILE THAT CHANGED THE WORLD (is yours) was installed at The Westmoreland Museum of American Art. Hundreds of attendees of all ages (2 to 87) and from all walks of life added their bright, inspiring smiles. THE SMILE was then exhibited in the Robertshaw Gallery at The Westmoreland through July 3, 2016. The purpose of his SMILE piece is to visually remind the participants and viewers how they each make a difference in this world and how ultimately we are all interconnected. THE SMILE originally debuted with installations in Canada and Washington, D.C. THE SMILE piece will be installed and repeated in several upcoming cities and events, and eventually all the canvasses will one day be sewn together in an installation to form MILES OF OUR SMILES ACROSS THE WORLD. Early writing John's first published writing was a front-page feature article in his hometown newspaper, The Daily Press, about his family's 4th of July parade tradition. He chronicled how every July 4 his family celebrates the holiday with a private family parade at their woodland retreat. The tradition was started by his Great Uncle Frank Straub, who served as the family's Uncle Sam, almost fifty years ago.‚ÄúStraub Family Carries On Independence Day Tradition‚Äù, The Daily Press, July 3, 1996.‚ÄúFamily Tradition Marches On With Fourth Of July Parade‚Äù, Erie Daily Times, July 4, 1997.

I, ¬ß 8 The Bankruptcy Code provides for several different types of bankruptcy case, each of which is addressed in a separate \\"chapter\\" of the Code. The most common type of bankruptcy is liquidation under chapter 7 of the Code, which applies to both individual and corporate debtors. In a chapter 7 case, an individual debtor's non-exempt assets are placed into a bankruptcy estate under the control of a court- appointed trustee for distribution to creditors, and the debtor usually receives a discharge of his or her remaining debts. Alternatively, an individual who earns regular income and whose income is less than a specified annual maximum may instead choose to file a chapter 13 case, under which the individual agrees to repay all or a portion of his or her debts under a repayment plan approved by the bankruptcy court. (There is also an additional option, chapter 12, available for debtors who are farmers or fishermen.) Another type of bankruptcy case is reorganization under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. In a chapter 11 case, unless the court orders otherwise, the debtor retains operating control of their assets as a \\"debtor in possession\\" and is allowed a period of time within which to propose a \\"plan of reorganization\\" to address creditor claims. The procedures for chapter 11 reorganization cases are complex and were widely understood to apply only to business debtors--that is, business entities such as corporations, and individuals who were the owners of a business enterprise. However, the Code did not expressly state that chapter 11 excluded individuals who were not engaged in business from filing a chapter 11 case. Facts and procedural history Sheldon Toibb, an individual in financial distress, filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in Missouri. Among his assets, Toibb listed stock in corporation. The stock later turned out to be worth more than Toibb had expected. Toibb filed a motion to convert his bankruptcy case from a chapter 7 liquidation to a chapter 11 reorganization, to avoid the liquidation of the stock. The bankruptcy court initially granted the motion, but later ordered Toibb \\"to show cause why his petition should not be dismissed because petitioner was not engaged in business and, therefore, did not qualify as a chapter 11 debtor.\\"Toibb, 501 U.S. at 159. Toibb argued that he was engaged in a business, or in the alternative, that individuals who do not own businesses are also eligible for relief under Chapter 11. The bankruptcy court rejected these arguments based on Eighth Circuit precedent and Wamsganz v. Boatmen's Bank of De Soto, 804 F.2d 503 (8th Cir. 1986) held that Toibb \\"failed to qualify for relief under Chapter 11.\\" Toibb appealed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, which affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy judge. On further appeal, the Eighth Circuit also affirmed. Toibb petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to review the Eighth Circuit's decision, based on conflicting decisions between the Eighth Circuit, which had held that only businesses and business owners may file for chapter 11, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which had held that individuals can file under chapter 11 even if they do not own a business.See Opinion of the Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote the opinion of the Court, speaking for eight Justices. The Court held that nothing in the Bankruptcy Code prevents an individual debtor from filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, even if he or she is not engaged in a business. The Court's opinion stated that in interpreting a statute, courts \\"look first to the statutory language and then to the legislative history if the statutory language is unclear.\\"Toibb, 501 U.S. at 501 U.S. at 162 (quoting Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 896 (1984)). Here, the relevant statute was Section 109 of the Bankruptcy Code, which defines who may be a debtor under the different chapters or types of bankruptcy case.See 501 U.S. at 160. Section 109(d) provides that \\"[o]nly a person that may be a debtor under chapter 7 of this title, except a stockbroker or a commodity broker, and a railroad may be a debtor under chapter 11 of this title.\\" In turn, Section 109(b) provides that \\"[a] person may be a debtor under chapter 7 of this title\\" as long as the person is not a railroad, insurance company, or bank or similar financial institution.Toibb, 501 U.S. at 501 U.S. at 160 (quoting 11 U.S.C. ¬ß 109 (1988)). Nothing in the text of the Code requires that only businesses or individuals engaged in a business can file for chapter 11 reorganization. Given the great care with which Congress enumerated11 U.S.C. ¬ß 109 (1988) [See Pub. L. 95‚Äì598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2557, as amended by Pub.

Turning to the legislative history of the then- current version of the Bankruptcy Code, the Court acknowledged that a Senate report showed that Congress anticipated that businesses would be the most common parties to file under chapter 11. However, this did not show that only businesses could permissibly file under chapter 11.Toibb, 501 U.S. at 162 (quoting S.Rep. No. 95-989, p. 3 (1978)). Likewise, the Court considered the ultimate purposes of the various chapters of the Code, one of which is \\"maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate\\";Toibb, 501 U.S. at 163. because a chapter 11 reorganization plan must be approved by creditors or must provide that creditors \\"will receive not less than they would receive under a Chapter 7 liquidation,\\"Toibb, 501 U.S. at 164 (quoting 11 U.S.C. ¬ß 1129(a)(7) (1988)). denying chapter 11 protection to individuals would not advance Congress' overall purpose. Finally, the Court considered the possibility that if chapter 11 were held to apply to individuals, an individual could be subjected to an involuntary chapter 11 case leading to \\"debt peonage,\\" a form of involuntary servitude). (Although chapter 13 bankruptcy petitions are always voluntary, a chapter 11 case can be commenced by creditors.) However, the Court observed, if a debtor chose not to cooperate in a chapter 11 case, the bankruptcy court could simply to convert the case to a chapter 7 liquidation. =Justice Stevens' dissent= Justice Stevens dissented, acknowledging that \\"[t]he Court's reading of the statute is plausible,\\" given that the statutory language does not expressly exclude non-business debtors from chapter 11 and the Senate Report language quoted in the majority opinion. Nonetheless, Justice Stevens disagreed with the Court's conclusion, opining that chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code was intended to apply to business debtors only. In support of his view, Justice Stevens noted that chapter 11 is entitled \\"Reorganization,\\" and that the statutory language of chapter 11 refer repeatedly to a \\"business.\\" Additionally, while section 109(d) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that only a person that may be a debtor under chapter 7 may be a debtor under chapter 11, it does not provide that all persons eligible under chapter 7 may also file under chapter 11.Toibb, 501 U.S. at 167 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Turning to legislative history to resolve this ambiguity, Stevens agreed that the Senate Report assumes that only businesses would ever file under chapter 11. While the Senate Report does not exclude the possibility that individuals may make use of that chapter as well, it notes that the cost of filing for chapter 11 would likely prevent individuals from using it. Moreover, Justice Stevens continued, the corresponding House Report \\"unambiguously states that a Chapter 7 liquidation is 'the only remedy' for 'consumer debtors [who] are unable to avail themselves of the relief provided under chapter 13.'\\"Toibb, 501 U.S. at 168, citing \\"H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, p. 125 (1977). See also 124 Cong.Rec., at 32392, 32405 (Chapter 11 is 'a consolidated approach to business rehabilitation' and a 'new commercial reorganization chapter') (statement of Rep. Edwards).\\" Justice Stevens also stressed that the Code allows involuntary chapter 11 cases and that if individuals not engaged in business were subject to chapter 11, the Code does not protect them from being subject to such a filing.See Toibb, 501 U.S. at 169. For these reasons, Stevens concluded in dissent that chapter 11 should apply only to \\"business debtors.\\" Discussion Toibb stands for the counterintuitive proposition that individuals can file for chapter 11 \\"reorganization\\" under the Bankruptcy Code. The complexity and cost of chapter 11 bankruptcy is rather high (the case-filing fee alone is $1000). However, a New York Times article reports that chapter 11 may be \\"an attractive alternative for individuals who have relatively large debts and relatively large income, or at least the expectation of future income, with which to finance a repayment plan.\\" Toibb has not been overruled by any subsequent decision of the Supreme Court,See and although the Bankruptcy Code has since been amended, individuals remain eligible to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 11.See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (2005); Pub. L. No. 106-554, app. E, 114 Stat. 2763, 2763A-365 to 2763A-462 (2000).

It is found in wet places under birch and aspen woodlands across Europe and North America. It has a yellow cap, white gills and stipe and bruises grey. It is mild-tasting and regarded as good to eat. Taxonomy It was described in 1888 by William Bywater Grove, based on a specimen from Sutton Park in the English Midlands. Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin clarus 'bright' or 'clear', and flava 'light yellow'. Description This medium-sized member of the genus Russula has a cap that is an egg-yolk yellow. Measuring 4‚Äì10 cm (1.5 4 in) in diameter, it is slightly sticky when moist, and leaves and other debris often stick to it. There is usually a slight depression in the centre of mature specimens, with the margin becoming furrowed. The cap is half peeling. The high stem is white, fairly firm, straight and 1‚Äì2 cm thick. Its gills are pale ochre, and are adnexed to almost free. All parts turn dark grey on aging or bruising. The smell is fruity and the spore print is pale ochre, and the oval warty spores average 9.5 x 8 Œºm. The edible but acrid Russula ochroleuca resembles this species, but has a duller yellow cap. Distribution and habitat Russula claroflava appears in summer and autumn, usually with birch (Betula), or aspen (Populus), on heaths and moors, preferring damp places near ponds or lakes, often occurring in sphagnum. It is occasionally found in drier places. It occurs in Britain, across northern Europe, and throughout North America. Edibility This mushroom is edible and good, with a mild taste, both in Europe and North America.

Ligier Richier (c. 1500‚Äì1567) was a French sculptor active in Saint- Mihiel in north-eastern France. Richier primarily worked in the churches of his native Saint-Mihiel and from 1530 he enjoyed the protection of Duke Antoine of Lorraine, for whom he did important work. Whilst Richier did sometimes work in wood, he preferred the pale, soft limestone with its fine grain, and few veins, extracted at Saint Mihiel and Sorcy and when working in this medium he experimented with refined polishing techniques, with which he was able to give the stone a marble-like appearance. One of his finest works is the \\"Groupe de la Passion\\", consisting of 13 life-size figures made in the local stone of the Meuse region. It can be found in the Church of St. √âtienne.Brief Biography of Ligier Richier It is also known as the \\"P√¢moison de la Vierge\\" (Swoon of the Virgin, the Virgin fainting, supported by St John).List of Sights in Saint-Mihiel Other works attributed to him are in the Church of St. Pierre, Bar-le-Duc, and in the Louvre.

He was apparently unsuccessful, for in 1564 he joined his daughter Bernadine in Geneva, Switzerland. She had married Pierre Godart, another Protestant who left Lorraine because of his religious beliefs.

The first plot line features a small-time drug dealer Nike (Mladen Vuliƒá) and a young widow Marija (Nives Ivankoviƒá); the second plot line deals with a drug addict called Maja (Marija ≈†kariƒçiƒá) who decides to have sex with a US Navy sailor called Franky (Coolio) in exchange for some heroin; the third one shows a young couple, Luka and Anƒëela (Vicko Biland≈æiƒá and Ivana Ro≈°ƒçiƒá) who spend the night desperately looking for a place to celebrate the New Year by having their first sexual experience. The plots are connected through a drug dealer Crni (Marinko Prga), through Dino Dvornik's concert, where all of them pass through at some point, and through the omnipresent fireworks that dot the night sky over the course of the film. Cast * Mladen Vuliƒá as Nike, drug dealer * Nives Ivankoviƒá as Marija, young widow * Marija ≈†kariƒçiƒá as Maja, drug addict * Coolio as Franky, US Navy sailor stationed in Split * as Luka, a young man * Ivana Ro≈°ƒçiƒá as Anƒëela, a young woman * Dino Dvornik as himself * Marinko Prga as Crni, drug dealer  Production Ostojiƒá had considered a role for Dino Dvornik ever since he started writing the screenplay, seeing him as a person who best embodies the spirit of the city of Split. Dvornik readily accepted the offer, taking keen interest in the story, and even gave several suggestions that made it into the film. Since the film was designed as a visual commentary of social problems that Split is well known for in Croatia, depicted here as always involving drugs and awkward relationships, the whole film was shot in black-and-white photography. The resulting effect is an atmosphere of anxiety and depression, set to contrast the colorful mood of open-air New Year celebrations in Split's main square. Reception The film won the Golden Arena awards for Best Cinematography (Marko Pivƒçeviƒá) and Best Film Editing (Dubravko Slunjski) at the 2004 Pula Film Festival, as well as the Birch award for best directing debut and the Oktavijan critics' choice award. The film's cinematographer, Mirko Pivƒçeviƒá, was nominated for the Golden Frog award at the Camerimage festival, the most renowned European festival dedicated to cinematography, and the film was also shown at the Sarajevo Film Festival as part of their regional program, where it won the Special Jury Prize, and Heart of Sarajevo for Best Actress (Marija ≈†kariƒçiƒá). It has also earned the director, Arsen Ostojiƒá, a nomination for the European Discovery of the Year at the European Film Awards, as well as the Best Feature Film award at the 2006 RiverRun International Film Festival.

It lived in the Paleocene of Morocco. Described by Hua and Jouve in 2004, the type species is A. krebsi, with the species named for . Argochampsa had a long narrow snout, and appears to have been marine in habits. Argochampsa is based on OCP DEK-GE 1201, a nearly complete skull from the Oulad Abdoun Basin, in the vicinity of Khouribga, Morocco. The skull, 43.3 centimeters long (17.0 in), had a long, narrow snout, marking it as a longirostrine crocodilian; the snout made up about 70% of the skull's length. The premaxillae at the tip of the snout were downturned, and the tip somewhat squared off, with the first few tooth positions in a straight line perpendicular to the long axis of the skull. There were five teeth in each premaxilla and 26 in each maxilla (the main tooth-bearing bone of the upper jaw). The nasal bones were fused, and there were several short diastemas or gaps in the tooth row at the tip of the snout. More recently, material from the lower jaw, neck and back vertebrae, the upper arm, and armor has been recovered. Hua and Jouve performed a cladistic analysis incorporating their new taxon, and found Argochampsa to be a gavialoid, but outside of the clade Gavialidae. They noted that the snout shape of Argochampsa is unusual among crocodilians, with only pholidosaurids and Terminonaris having similarly shaped snout tips, and suggested that this layout may have facilitated precise occlusion. Argochampsa lived in an environment otherwise dominated by dyrosaurid marine crocodyliforms. Argochampsa krebsi was included in the study on the phylogenetic relationships of putative fossil gavialoids published by Lee & Yates (2018). The authors considered it most likely that Argochampsa was not a gavialoid, or even a crocodylian, but rather a member of the clade of non-crocodylian eusuchians that also included the genera Eogavialis, Eosuchus, Eothoracosaurus and Thoracosaurus.

Edwards, 554 U.S. 164 (2008), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the standard for competency to stand trial was not linked to the standard for competency to represent oneself. BackgroundPrior jurisprudence= The Court had recognized these two rights on competency for some time. In Dusky v. United States, , and in Drope v. Missouri, , the Court established the standard for competency to stand trial--the defendant must have a \\"rational and factual understanding\\" of the nature of the proceedings, and must be able to rationally assist his lawyer in defending him. In Faretta v. California, , the Court held that a criminal defendant cannot be forced to have a lawyer if he does not wish it, but that before the defendant relinquishes his right to counsel the trial judge must ensure that the defendant understands the \\"dangers and disadvantages\\" of representing himself. With the decision in Godinez v. Moran, , the Court held that a defendant may plead guilty (and thereby waive both his right to counsel and his right to represent himself) if he is competent to stand trial. Until Edwards, however, it remained an open question whether a criminal defendant could be simultaneously competent to stand trial and yet not competent to represent himself. The Court answered that question in the affirmative. The logic is that representing oneself at trial is more complicated than deciding what to plead. =Edwards' trial= Ahmad Edwards, who suffers from schizophrenia, tried to steal a pair of shoes from a department store in Indiana. Store detectives caught him in the act, and he drew a gun, fired at a store security officer, and wounded an innocent bystander. He was charged with attempted murder, battery with a deadly weapon, criminal recklessness, and theft. In 2000, he was deemed not competent to stand trial, and ordered to the state hospital for treatment. After seven months of treatment, he was restored to competency. Yet in 2002, his lawyers asked for another competency evaluation. That second competency evaluation resulted in a determination that Edwards was indeed competent to stand trial, although he still suffered from a mental illness. As trial preparations proceeded, his lawyers asked for a third competency evaluation, and in 2003 Edwards was again found not competent to stand trial and again committed to the state hospital. Eight months later, Edwards was again restored to competence, and trial preparations began again. In June 2005, as trial began, Edwards asked to represent himself and asked for a continuance in the trial. The judge denied the request for a continuance, and Edwards therefore proceeded to trial with counsel. He was convicted of criminal recklessness and theft, but the jury could not reach a verdict as to the attempted murder and battery charges. Before the second trial on the attempted murder and battery charges, Edwards again asked to represent himself. The judge denied that request, pointing to the lengthy record of Edwards's mental illness. Edwards proceeded to trial with appointed counsel, and was convicted of the attempted murder and battery charges. =Appeals= Edwards appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals, arguing that his right to represent himself at trial was violated. The court agreed with Edwards and ordered a new trial. The State then appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court, which also agreed with Edwards. It reasoned that Faretta and Moran required the state to allow Edwards to represent himself at trial. The State of Indiana asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision, and it agreed to do so. Opinion of the Court As Justice Breyer noted in his majority opinion for the Court, the Court's competency and self-representation cases \\"frame the question presented, but they do not answer it.\\" A defendant who has a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings and who can rationally assist trial counsel is competent to stand trial. And a defendant who voluntarily and intelligently elects to stand trial without counsel--something he can only do if he is competent to stand trial to begin with--may do so. Even so, the right of self-representation is not absolute, and standby counsel may be appointed to assist the pro se defendant in matters of procedure and courtroom decorum. The Court came closest to answering the question presented by this case when it held that the standard for competency to stand trial and competency to plead guilty are the same, because the decision not to stand trial is \\"no more complicated than the sum total of decisions that a [represented] defendant may be called upon to make during the course of a trial.\\" The crucial difference in Edwards, was that the pro se defendant was asking to proceed to trial without counsel. The difference, in other words, is the difference between the ability to end trial proceedings on one's own and the ability to conduct trial proceedings on one's own. The Court ultimately concluded that, in light of these rules, a state may require an otherwise competent criminal defendant to proceed to trial with the assistance of counsel. The standard for competency to stand trial presumes that the defendant will have a lawyer to assist him at that trial. Implicit therefore in the Dusky rule is the idea that the standard for competency to stand trial must be lower than the standard for competency to represent oneself. The right to represent oneself at trial is qualified by the trial court's interest in preserving courtroom decorum and promoting the orderly presentation of evidence, questioning of witnesses, and advancement of legal argument. For the Court, it was \\"common sense\\" that a defendant's mental illness might impair his ability to accomplish these tasks--tasks that any lawyer must if he is to press his client's case effectively. \\"A right of self- representation at trial will not affirm the dignity of a defendant who lacks the mental capacity to conduct his defense without the assistance of counsel.\\" Moreover, the Court separated the standards for competency to stand trial and for competency to represent oneself out of a concern for the fairness of the trial process. Criminal trials \\"must not only be fair, they must appear fair to all who observe them.\\" \\"No trial can be fair that leaves the defense to a man who is insane, unaided by counsel, and who by reason of his mental condition stands hopeless and alone before the court.\\" For these reasons, the Constitution allows trial courts to \\"take realistic account of the particular defendant's mental capacities by asking whether a defendant who seeks to conduct his own defense at trial is mentally competent to do so.\\" =Dissenting opinion= Characterizing the right of self-representation as \\"a specific right long understood as essential to a fair trial,\\" Justice Scalia disputed the Court's conclusion that \\"a State may... strip a mentally ill defendant of the right to represent himself when that would be fairer.\\" Because counsel's role under the Sixth Amendment is merely one of \\"assistance,\\" or because the \\"right of self-representation could also be seen as a part of the traditional meaning of the Due Process Clause,\\" Faretta had held that a state may not force a lawyer upon a defendant who does not want one. Faretta required the trial judge to inform Edwards about the dangers and disadvantages of representing himself, and Scalia believed that Edwards had taken that warning to heart. For Scalia, ultimately the right of self- representation rests on the right to present one's own case to the jury, however foolhardy an endeavor that might be. Scalia also rejected the \\"dignity\\" premise that supported the Court's decision. \\"While there is little doubt that preserving individual dignity (to which the Court refers) is paramount,\\" he wrote, \\"there is equally little doubt that the loss of dignity the right [of self-representation] is designed to prevent is not the defendant's making a fool of himself by presenting an amateurish or even incoherent defense. Rather, the dignity at issue is the supreme human dignity of being master of one's fate rather than a ward of the State--the dignity of individual choice.\\" Scalia necessarily overlooks the possibility that a mental illness could impair a person's ability to rationally make a dignified individual choice whether or not to have representation and as to the proper defense while at the same time not impair his ability to understand the nature of the proceedings of which he is at the center and rationally assist his representation, as required under Dusky. Godinez had found that the competency standard for pleading guilty or waiving one's right to counsel was the same as the standard for standing trial; therefore in Scalia's view if Edwards had the right to waive his defense completely he surely had the lesser right to mount a (presumably inferior) pro se defense. Finally, consistent with his originalist theory, Scalia sought to quell doubts regarding the authenticity of the right of self-representation. \\"The right is not explicitly set forth in the text of the Sixth Amendment, and some Members of this Court [including Justice Breyer] have expressed skepticism about Faretta's holding.\\" But, Scalia pointed out, the Sixth Amendment gave the defendant personally, and not his lawyer, the right to call witnesses on his behalf, the right to confront the prosecution's witnesses against him, and to have counsel assist him (assuming he so wishes). If the defendant is bound by counsel's decisions not to call certain witnesses or not to cross-examine others, he must have the right to represent himself in order to give substance to those other rights the Sixth Amendment protects. \\"Otherwise, the defense presented is not the defense guaranteed him by the Constitution, for in a very real sense, it is not his defense.\\" Implications Alan R. Felthous notes that an implication of this decision is that after a defendant has been found competent to stand trial, if he then wishes to represent himself, a separate evaluation may be required to determine whether he meets the higher standard of competency required to be his own lawyer, unless the earlier evaluation already assessed both competencies. Since the Supreme Court did not establish a specific standard for competence to represent oneself, this task has been left to the legislatures and lower courts.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961 for its well-preserved late boom-town architecture.Christine Whitacre (November 1987) , National Park Service and Description and history Telluride's history begins with the discovery of silver in the area in 1875, resulting in the creation of a large mining camp, which was incorporated in 1878. The city's importance as a mining center was cemented by the construction of a wagon road in 1882 and the arrival of the railroad in 1890, facilitating the transport of the mined ores to smelters further east. The arrival of the railroad also spurred a construction boom, resulting in much of the historic architecture seen in the city today. The historic district includes most of Colorado Street, which serves as the city's main commercial avenue. The city was laid out in a manner typical of other boom towns, with higher-end housing on the slope above the main street, and lower class housing and industrial activities set below it, along with its red light district, gambling saloons, and the city jail. Distinctive surviving elements in the latter area include several bordello cribs, small wood-frame portable structures from which prostitutes plied their trade.

Fictional history Originating from the Seven Soldiers: Mister Miracle mini-series (there was also an earlier Dark Side Club that appeared in a few issues of Justice League International, but that seems to be unrelated to the current one), the Dark Side Club serves as the stronghold for Darkseid (known as \\"Boss Dark Side\\") and the Apokoliptian New Gods stranded on Earth and a recruiting central for new loyal servants. Similar in concept to the former Roulette fight club, the Dark Side Club provides his wealthy patrons with an underground fighting ring, where brainwashed metahumans are forced to fight in often deadly battles. In a human recreation of Granny Goodness' orphanage, the captured metahumans, usually the youngest or the most obscure, are fed drugs concocted by Bernadeth and routinely abused and controlled by Granny. Among the most known victims of the Dark Side Club there are the Tornado Twins, children of the third Flash and Misfit, young proteg√®e of the Birds of Prey. Since all of them manage to escape, their capture backfires on the Boss Dark Side, alerting the larger heroic community on their activities, and letting Misfit and Black Alice deal crippling blows to the organization, like killing Granny Goodness during their escape. Dark Side then hires the Terror Titans in order to capture the Teen Titans, granting the new Clock King the role once held by Granny and Bernadeth as the chief captor and brainwasher. In such role the Terror Titans manage to capture Red Devil and Miss Martian, brainwashing the former into a feral, mindless beast, and forcing the latter into undo his mental damage. However, not every captured metahuman is deemed fit to fight alongside the Boss Dark Side, and Doctor Bud Fogel (actually the Dark God Desaad) is sent to capture the Infinitors and deal aggressively with the Everymen kids, the younger heroes receiving often unwanted powers from Lex Luthor's exogene. Double Trouble is killed, and Vaporlock, Amazing Woman, and Empathy are captured, and forced to power a machine meant to rid the Everymen of their lingering powers, deemed too unpredictable and unstable to be used by the Dark Side Club. As a side effect, the still living Infinitors vanish. The Club returns in the Terror Titans, where the Terror Titans are shown retaining their chief role, and granting the Dark Side Club a more business driven facade, more similar to the Roulette underground fight club. They manage to capture a cadre of new legacy, semi-obscure heroes, and Clock King hires Ravager as his minion and trainer. Rose begrudgingly accepts, still refusing to embrace the cruel ways of the Club and refusing to give up her independent will, apparently with a secret agenda of her own.Terror Titans Stand the Test of (Clock King‚Äôs) Time , Comic Book Resources, August 14, 2008 In the Final Crisis series, Dan Turpin is shown discovering that the Club has been capturing metahuman children, and teaching them to say the Anti-Life Equation.

It is highly believed that the belief surrounding the said Manaul originated during the dominance of the Confederation of Madja-as.

Green was invited by Wright to join Taliesin as an apprentice in the early 1940s, from which point the two maintained a close friendship.Aaron Green Associates - Aaron G. Green Biography Green enlisted in the Air Force during World War II, serving as a bombardier in the Pacific theater. After the war, he moved to Los Angeles and worked as an interior designer with industrial designer Raymond Loewy. During this time, he married and began a family. In 1951, Green moved to San Francisco and founded Aaron G. Green Associates, Inc., an architectural practice dedicated to service-oriented design.Aaron Green Associates - Firm Profile In this organization, Green acted as Wright's West Coast representative. Green participated in forty of Wright's projects. At the time of Wright's death in 1959, the Marin County Civic Center was uncompleted, and Green saw the project through to completion In 1968, he became a member of the College of Fellows, American Institute of Architects. He taught as a lecturer and critic at Stanford University's department of architecture for fifteen years. In 2001, he became the first recipient of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation's Gold Medal.

It was first published in 1917, so it is in the public domain.Buttel, p. 206. Poetic narrative The dweller in the dark cabin may be understood to be the specifically poetical dreamer, like the old sailor in \\"Disillusionment of Ten O'Clock\\". Stevens enjoins him not to sleep in his dream, but rather to explore its riches. If the sleeper rises to do so, he will not waken, for he is still in the dream. The poem should be compared to \\"Anecdote of Canna\\". (In another vein, it can also be compared to \\"Of Heaven Considered As a Tomb\\", in which the poet exhorts \\"interpreters\\" to \\"Make hue among the dark comedians\\" and \\"Halloo them in the topmost distances\\" as he in this poem exhorts his addressee, a \\"dweller in a dark cabin\\", to \\"hail, cry hail, cry hail\\".) Interpretation Doggett interprets the poem differently, without imputing a dream world explored by the poet. The dweller is the self, and the dark cabin is the body. The dweller's \\"sense of reality is obscured as though in a dream, but beside [his] cabin is the vivid actual plantain of green reality and the sun\\".Doggett, p. 374. Buttel comments on the poem's title. \\"How appropriate\\", he writes, \\"for Stevens' theme to infuse, by such imaginative conjoinings [American watermelon, French pavilion], the earthy, vigorous reality of America with the grace of French words.

This is in distinction to adaptation to global warming, which involves taking action to minimize the effects of global warming. Scientific consensus on global warming, together with the precautionary principle and the fear of non- linear climate transitions, is leading to increased effort to develop new technologies and sciences and carefully manage others in an attempt to mitigate global warming. In order to make a significant change, coal from Australia needs to be replaced with alternatives. Map of Australian renewable power plants Carbon capture and storage in Australia has been put forward as a solution for production of clean hydrogen from natural gas. Following the introduction of government mandatory renewable energy targets, more opportunities have opened up for renewable energy technologies such as wind power, photovoltaics, and solar thermal technologies. The deployment of these technologies provides opportunities for mitigating greenhouse gases. A carbon price was introduced on 1 July 2012 by the government of Julia Gillard with the purpose of reducing Australia's carbon emissions. It requires large businesses (defined as those with annual carbon dioxide equivalent emissions over 25,000 tonnes annually) to pay a price for emissions permits. The tax was scrapped by the Abbott government in July 2014 in what was a widely criticized and highly publicized move.  Policy overview  The economic impact of a 60% reduction of emissions by 2050 was modeled in 2006 in a study commissioned by the Australian Business Roundtable on Climate Change.http://www.businessroundtable.com.au/html/documents.html The World Resources Institute identifies policy uncertainty and over-reliance on international markets as the top threats to Australia's GHG mitigation.http://pdf.wri.org/ghg_mitigation_in_australia_overview_of_current_policy_landscape.pdf = International = Internationally, Australia contributed to the creation of the Asia Pacific Rain Forest Partnership, International Coral Reef Initiative, International Partnership for Blue Carbon, Mission Innovation, Clean Energy Ministerial Forum, International Solar Alliance, and the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/18690271-59ac-43c8-aee1-92d930141f54/files/2017-review- of-climate-change-policies.pdf The government has also provided $1 billion to assist developing countries in reducing GHG emissions, partly through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Green Climate Fund. Australia's scientists also provide data on climate, emissions, impacts, and mitigation options for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessments. Under the Paris Agreement, Australia has committed to reducing emission by 26-28% below 2005 levels. This would mean reducing emissions by half per capita and by two-thirds across the economy. The Department of Environment and Energy noted in a 2017 review that no one policy could achieve what multiple, sector-specific ones have. This approach has manifested in Australia meeting its first Kyoto Protocol target. Australia is now bound to reducing emissions to at least 5% by 2020 under the Copenhagen Accord and Cancun Agreements and .5% less than 1990 levels by 2020 under their second target for the Kyoto Protocol. =Domestic= After contributing to the development of, then signing but not ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, action to address climate change was coordinated through the Australian Greenhouse Office. The Australian Greenhouse Office released the National Greenhouse Strategy in 1998. The report recognized climate change was of global significance and that Australia had an international obligation to address the problem. In 2000 the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee conducted an inquiry that produced The Heat is On: Australia's Greenhouse Future. One of Australia's first national attempt to reduce emissions was the voluntary-based initiative called the Greenhouse Challenge Program which began in 1995. A collection of measures which focused on reducing the environmental impacts of the energy sector were released by Prime Minister John Howard on 20 November 1997 in a policy statement called Safeguarding Our Future: Australia's Response to Climate Change. One measure was the establishment of the Australian Greenhouse Office, which was set up as the world's first dedicated greenhouse office in April 1998. Domestically, the Clean Energy Act 2011 addresses GHG with an emissions cap, carbon price, and subsidies. Emissions by the electric sector are addressed by Renewable Energy targets at multiple scales, Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), carbon capture and storage flagships, and feed-in tariffs on solar panels. Emissions by the industrial sector are addressed by the Energy Efficiency Opportunities (EEO) program. Emissions by the building sector are addressed by building codes, minimum energy performance standards, Commercial Building Disclosure program, state energy-saving obligations, and the National Energy Saving Initiative. Emissions by the transportation sector are addressed by reduced fuel tax credits and vehicle emissions performance standards. Emissions by the agricultural sector are addressed by the Carbon Farming Initiative and state land-clearing laws. Emissions by the land use sector are addressed by the Clean Energy Future Package, which consists of the Carbon Farming Futures program, Diversity Fund, Regional Natural Resources Management Planning for Climate Change Fund, Indigenous Carbon Farming Fund, Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS), and Carbon Farming Skills program. State energy saving schemes vary by state, with the Energy Saving Scheme (ESS) in North South Wales, Residential Energy Efficiency Scheme (REES) in South Australia, Energy Saver Incentive Scheme (ESI) in Victoria, and Energy Efficiency Improvement Scheme (EEIS) in Australian Capital Territory.  Carbon Trading and Emission Trading Scheme  In June 2007, former Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, announced that Australia would adopt a Carbon Trading Scheme by 2012. The scheme was expected to be the same as the counterpart in United States and European Union using carbon credits, where businesses must purchase a license in order to generate pollution. The scheme received broad criticism from both the ALP and Greens. The ALP believed that the scheme was too weak as well as a bad political move by the government. The lack of clear target by the government for this scheme before the 2007 federal election produced a high degree of skepticism on the willingness of the government on mitigation of global warming in Australia. In March 2008, the newly elected Labor government of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (a cap-and-trade emissions trading system) would be introduced in 2010, however this scheme was initially delayed by a year to mid-2011, and subsequently delayed further until 2013. In April 2010, Kevin Rudd announced the delay the CPRS until after the commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, which ends in 2012. Reasons given were the lack of bipartisan support for the CPRS and slow international progress on climate action for the delay. The Federal Opposition strongly criticized the delay as did community and grassroots action groups such as GetUp. = Prime Ministerial Task Group =Carbon taxation Another method of mitigation of global warming considered by the Australian Government is a carbon tax. This method would involve imposing an additional tax on the use of fossil fuels to generate energy. Compared to the CPRS and CTS/ETS, a carbon tax would set the cost for all carbon emissions, while the cap itself would be left unattended, allowing free market movements. This tax would primarily be aimed to reduce the use of fossil fuels for energy generation, and also look to increase efficient energy use and increase demand for alternative energies. A carbon tax was introduced by the government of Julia Gillard on 1 July 2012. It requires businesses emitting over 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions annually to purchase emissions permits, which initially cost A$23 for one tonne of CO2 equivalent. The tax was repealed by the Australian senate on 17 July 2014. The reason given for the repeal by Australia's 2014 prime minister Tony Abbot was that the tax cost jobs and increased energy prices. Opponents to the repeal say that there has been an increase in Australian pollution since the tax's repeal. Since the repeal there has been several calls to re-implement the tax from multiple public figures, including Woodside Petroleum CEO Peter Coleman.  Coal  Coal is the most polluting of all fossil fuels, and the single greatest threat to the climate. Every stage of coal use brings substantial environmental damage. Phasing out dirty, unsustainable energy is one of the most important elements to climate change mitigation. Today coal supplies almost one quarter of the world's energy. Brown coal is by far the most polluting, and is currently used in Victoria. In order to have significant effects on greenhouse gas emissions, there needs to be a replacement of coal energy with alternatives within Victoria. Reduction in the mining, use and export of coal is favored by environmental groups such as Greenpeace. The Government prefers to support attempts to develop so-called \\"clean coal\\" pollution mitigation, and, in early 2009, had support from then opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull for this. According to Dr Mark Diesendorf, a senior lecturer at the Institute of Environmental Studies at the University of New South Wales, Australia, and a former principal research scientist with the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the continent produced about 200 million tons (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2004. Almost all of the coal emissions were emitted by coal fired power stations. On top of this coal is responsible for 42.1% of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, not counting export coal, based on 2004 GHG inventory. Two forms of coal are mined in Australia, depending on the region: high quality black coal and lower quality brown coal. Black coal is mainly found in Queensland and New South Wales, and is used for both domestic power generation and for export overseas. It is normally mined underground before being transported to power stations, or export shipping terminals. Brown coal is mainly found in Victoria and South Australia, and is of lower quality due a higher ash and water content. Today there are three open cut brown coal mines in Victoria used for baseload power generation. Carbon capture and storage The Rudd-Gillard Government stated support for research into carbon capture and storage CCS as a possible solution to rising greenhouse gas emissions. CCS is an integrated process, made up of three distinct parts: carbon capture, transport, and storage (including measurement, monitoring and verification). Capture technology aims to produce a concentrated stream of CO2 that can be compressed, transported, and stored. Transport of captured CO2 to storage locations is most likely to be via pipeline. Storage of the captured carbon is the final part of the process. The vast majority of CO2 storage is expected to occur in geological sites on land, or below the seabed. Disposing of waste CO2 in the ocean has also been proposed, but this method has been largely discounted due to the significant impacts CO2 would have on the ocean ecosystem and legal constraints that effectively prohibit it. However, according to the Greenpeace False Hope Report, CCS cannot deliver in time to avoid a dangerous increase in world temperatures. The earliest timeframe for deployment of CCS is not expected before 2030, and global emissions need to start falling well before that. The Report also states that CCS wastes energy, and uses between 10-40% of the energy produced by a power station. It also asserts that CCS is expensive, potentially doubling plant costs, and is very risky, as permanent storage cannot be guaranteed. Nuclear energy Australia has approximately 40% of the world's uranium deposits, and is the world's third largest producer of uranium. Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions from nuclear power are low. The only nuclear reactor in Australia is currently located at Lucas Heights. The main argument against building more is that the cost of electricity from new nuclear is more expensive than new solar power. Other perceived problems include that enriched uranium can also be used as a nuclear weapon, prompting security issues such as nuclear proliferation. Also nuclear waste requires extensive waste management because it can remain radioactive for centuries. Renewable energy The information centre near the base of one of the towers at Wattle Point Wind Farm Renewable energy technologies currently contribute about 6.2% of Australia's total energy supply and 21.3% of Australia's electricity supply, with hydro-electricity the largest single contributor and wind power a close second. At the end of 2018, Australia had 17,002 gigawatt- hours (GWh) of installed hydro power capacity, 16,171 GWh of installed wind power and 11,694 GWh of installed solar power. Initiatives are also being taken with ethanol fuel and geothermal energy exploration. =Renewable energy targets= Moving towards long-term mitigation policies is a requirement of government, and the Australian energy sectors remains a central area in national emissions. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reviewed the Australian energy sectors policies in 2018, the findings identified needed improvements to the countries emissions reduction targets, and further the energy sectors resilience. The IEA identified needed improvements in government leadership by establishing a well-defined long-term integrated energy policy and climate toolkit for policy development and deployment. The Australian Government has announced a mandatory renewable energy target (MRET) to ensure that renewable energy obtains a 20% share of electricity supply in Australia by 2020. To ensure this, the government has committed that the MRET will increase from 9,500 gigawatt-hours to 45,000 gigawatt-hours by 2020. After 2020 the proposed ETS and improved efficiencies from innovation and in manufacture are expected to allow the MRET to be phased out by 2030. Following the introduction of government Mandatory Renewable Energy Targets, more opportunities have opened up for renewable energies such as wind power, photovoltaics, and solar thermal technologies. The deployment of these technologies provides opportunities for mitigating greenhouse gases. =Wind power= Wind farms are highly compatible with agricultural and pastoral land use. While they span approximately 25 ha per MW of installed capacity, only about 1-3% of that land is actually taken up with their towers, access roads and other equipment. Wind turbines are also extremely efficient. Large wind turbines convert about 45% of the wind passing through the area swept out by the blades into electricity; by comparison, modern coal-fired power stations convert to electricity only 35% of the energy stored in coal. According to some experts, wind energy, at appropriate sites, is the most economical of all renewable energy sources other than large-scale hydro-electricity. =Bioenergy= Bioenergy is energy produced from biomass. Biomass is material produced by photosynthesis, or is an organic by-product from a waste stream. Thus it can be seen as stored solar energy. In terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, biomass offers four different types of contribution: * solid, liquid and gaseous biofuels can substitute for fossil fuels in the generation of electricity and useful heat; * liquid and gaseous biofuels can substitute for oil in transportation; * biomass can be used in place of many greenhouse intensive materials; * biomass can be converted to biochar, an organic char coal that greatly enhances the ability of soil to sequester carbon. Sustainable energy expert Mark Diesendorf suggests that bioenergy could produce 39% of Australia's electricity generation. = Solar heat and electricity = Solar heat and electricity together have the potential for supplying almost all of Australia's stationary energy. With suitable government policies, particularly at the state and local levels, solar hot water could cost-effectively provide the vast majority of hot water systems in Australia, and make considerable reductions in residential electricity consumption. Solar electricity's potential scale of application is huge and its prospects for further substantial cost reductions are excellent. Energy efficiency The most important energy saving options include improved thermal insulation and building design, super efficient electrical machines and drives, and a reduction in energy consumption by vehicles used for goods and passenger traffic. Industrialized countries such as Australia, which currently use energy in the least efficient way, can reduce their consumption drastically without the loss of either housing comfort or amenity.https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/uploads/7b40d7bbefbdd94979ce4de2fad52414.pdf Increased energy efficiency of buildings had the support of the former leader of the federal opposition, Malcolm Turnbull. Biochar Biochar has been promoted as a technique for mitigation of global warming. The former leader of the federal opposition, Malcolm Turnbull brought biochar into the political debate by announcing that burying agricultural waste was one of three under- invested areas that his mitigation strategy was committed to opening up. Publications and interest groups which track the fledgling Australian industry are divided over the suitability of biochar to the economy. Brian Toohey of The Australian Financial Review has said it is yet to be proven commercially viable. Friends of the Earth Australia, one of the larger environmental lobby groups, is fundamentally opposed to biochar, calling it \\"part of a series of false solutions to climate change\\" which will be \\"based on large-scale industrial plantations and will lead to the acquisition of large tracts of land, furthering the erosion of indigenous peoples' and community rights while not adequately addressing the climate crisis\\". Green Left Weekly has published several editorials supporting the development of a large-scale biochar industry. Reforestation Reforestation programs have adaptation and mitigation strategy overlap, and in 2016, the \\"20 million Trees Programme\\" was announced as a national strategy. The plan aims to further native resilience against climatic changes by creating a self-sustaining tree-based ecosystem by planting 20 million native trees across Australian by 2020. The Programme falls under the authority of the Australian Government's National Landcare Programme. Increasing the coverage of flora range has the potential and capability to increase the habitability potential of areas threatened by climatic change and improve ecological communities that may be threatened or endangered. The Commonwealth government announced a plan in 2019 which would invest in Australia's forestry industry by planting 1 billion trees in nine forestry hubs throughout Australia by 2030. Land management and biodiversity programs have emissions reduction benefits to both agricultural and environmental.https://www.sprep.org/att/IRC/eCOPIES/Pacific_Region/352.pdf Advantages stem from the lands ability to adapt to climatic changes by helping to fight soil erosion and stabilize soil as well as providing shelter to native and agricultural animals. AUD 1 billion will be invested the National Landcare program between 2018 and 2019 and 2022‚Äì23. Pathways for climate change mitigationGreenpeace energy revolution= Greenpeace calls for a complete energy revolution. There are some fundamental aspects to this revolution, aimed as changing the way that energy is produced, distributed and consumed. The five principles of this revolution are: * implement renewable solutions, especially through decentralized energy systems; * respect the natural limits of the environment; * phase out dirty, unsustainable energy sources; * create greater equity in the use of resources; * decouple economic growth from the consumption of fossil fuels. Other goals of the energy revolution are: * renewable energy: 40% of electricity provided by renewable sources by 2020; * coal-fired power will be phased out entirely by 2030; * using electricity for the transport system and cutting consumption of fossil fuels through efficiency. The energy revolution report also looks at policy suggestions for the Australian Government in regards to climate change. Policy suggestions of the report include: * legislate a greenhouse gas reduction target of greater than 40% below 1990 levels by 2020; * establish an emissions trading scheme that delivers a decrease of our emissions in line with legislated interim targets; * legislate a national target for 40% of electricity to be generated by renewable energy sources by 2020; * massively invest in the deployment of renewable energy and strongly regulate for energy efficiency measures; * establish an immediate moratorium on new coal-fired power stations and extensions to existing coal-fired power stations, and phase out existing coal-fired power stations in Australia by 2030; * set a target of 2% per year to reduce Australia's primary energy demand; * ensure transitional arrangements for coal dependent communities that might be affected by the transition to a clean energy economy; * redirect all public subsidies that encourage the use and production of fossil fuels towards implementing energy efficiency programs, deploying renewable energy and supporting the upgrading of public transport infrastructure; * develop a highly trained ‚Äúgreen‚Äù workforce through investment in training programs and apprenticeships. =Climate Code Red: The case for a sustainability emergency= Climate Code Red states that the key strategies for cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero are resource efficiency backed up by the substitution of renewable energy for fossil fuel sources. The report sites ultra-efficient technologies and synergies, and wind power as ways in which to tackle the climate change problem within Australia. Climate Code Red also has an outline for a rapid transition to a safe-climate economy. This plan includes: * having the building capacity to plan, coordinate and allocate resources for high priority infrastructure projects and to invest sufficiently in the means to make safe- climate producer and consumer goods; * fostering research and innovation to produce, develop and scale up the necessary technologies, products and processes; * national building and industry energy efficiency programmes, including mandatory and enforceable minimum standards for domestic and commercial buildings, and the allocation of public resources to help householders, especially those with limited financial capacity, to reduce energy use; * the rapid construction of capacity across a range of renewable technologies at both a national and micro level to produce sufficient electricity to allow the closure of the fossil fuel-fired generating industry; * the conversion and expansion of Australia's car industry to manufacture zero-emission vehicles for public and private transport; * the renewal and electrification of national and regional train networks to provide the capacity to shift all long-distance freight from road and air to rail; Further information: High-speed rail in Australia * providing safe-climate expertise, technologies, goods and services to less developed nations to support their transition to the post-carbon world; * adjustment and reskilling programmes for workers, communities and industries affected by the impacts of global warming and by the transition to the new economy. =Garnaut climate change reviewGreen paper 2008Climate Change Authority review= The Australian Climate Change Authority made recommendations to the Commonwealth government in 2016 to develop a toolkit of policies to guide the country into the future, the focal point for the 'toolkit' is Australia's Paris Agreement obligations. In 2017, the Commonwealth government commissioned an effectiveness' assessment of emissions reductions policies to meet its Paris Agreement obligations by 2030. The results of the evaluation were to develop both adaptation and mitigation measure which would cover all sectors of the economy, under the Paris Agreement these measure fall under \\"ratchet mechanism\\". To meet the 2030 Paris Agreements 2 ¬∞C limit of global median temperature rise a five-year review and adjustment cycle will commence beginning in 2023. Solutions There are a number of ways to achieve the goals outlined above. This includes implementing clean, renewable solutions and decentralizing energy systems. Existing technologies are available to use energy effectively and ecologically, including the use of solar, wind, and other renewable technologies, which have experienced double digit market growth globally in the last decade. A large section of the scientific community believe that one of the real solutions to avoiding dangerous climate change lies in renewable energy and energy efficiency that can start protecting the climate today. Technically accessible renewable energy sources such as wind, wave, and solar, are capable of providing six times more energy than the world currently consumes. As coal is one of the highest emitters of greenhouse gases, closing coal power stations is one of the most powerful tools for carbon emission reduction. The city of Melbourne is working with the wider Australian government to make Melbourne carbon neutral by the year 2050. The name of the plan is Melbourne Together for 1.5¬∞C. The plan includes ways for Melbourne to reduce the impact of waste, and models for how to reduce transport and building emissions to zero. This is a continuation off of a plan created in 2003 to have Melbourne carbon neutral by 2020, but this did not succeed.

He was the member for the Western Australian seat of Mount Leonora from 1911 until 1920, initially for the Labor Party until 1917 when he joined the National Labor Party. He then entered the Federal House of Representatives as the Nationalist member for the seat of Kalgoorlie, which he held until 1922. Biography Foley was born in Walhalla on the Victorian goldfields to Thomas Foley, a miner and railway employee, and Elizabeth Foley (n√©e Stamp). He was educated at local schools before entering a state training college in Melbourne and gaining employment with a newspaper in Richmond. He moved to Western Australia in 1895 and took up gold mining, becoming part-owner of the Grace Darling mine at Broad Arrow. On 27 January 1902, he married Fannie Gill at the Wesley Church in Kalgoorlie. He joined the Federated Miners Union and served as its Gwalia branch president, and later became president of the North Goldfields Council of the Labor Federation. Prior to the October 1911 state election, he was selected by Labor to contest the seat of Mount Leonora; he obtained 1,019 of the 1,172 valid votes cast and entered the Legislative Assembly. He won the seat without opposition at the 1914 election. In March 1917, the Labor Party split in Western Australia ahead of the 1917 federal election, and a number of Labor members, including Foley, either resigned from the Party or were expelled for supporting Nationalist Senate candidates. Former premier John Scaddan and several others formed the National Labor Party with a base in the Goldfields region. Foley won the state election later that year easily against a Labor opponent. In 1918, he was also elected to the Perth City Council for a one-year term. On 18 November 1920, Foley resigned from the Legislative Assembly to contest the Kalgoorlie federal by-election, which had been called due to the expulsion of Labor member Hugh Mahon from the House of Representatives. Foley contested the by-election as a Nationalist Party member, and won against Mahon. He was defeated at the 1922 election, and failed to win the state seat of Kimberley at the 1924 election. He worked as an auctioneer in Perth before retiring to Kalgoorlie. George Foley died on 27 October 1945 in the Perth suburb of Mount Hawthorn and was buried in the Congregationalist section of Karrakatta Cemetery. He had no children.

Mors killed eight elderly patients by poison while employed in a nursing home in New York City. He was very cooperative, readily admitting to the murders when questioned by police. After being arrested, Mors was diagnosed as a megalomaniac and committed to an insane asylum. He later escaped.  Immigration  Mors immigrated to New York City from his native Austria-Hungary in June 1914. The German-speaking Mors gained employment as a porter for the German Odd Fellows' Home in Unionport, New York (now the Bronx) through the Immigrant Free Employment Bureau. The home housed 250 orphans and 100 elderly men and women. Inexplicably, though he terrified the older residents, both the younger residents and visitors seemed to like him and enjoy his company. Mors exhibited signs of megalomania soon after beginning to work at the nursing home: he would wear a white lab coat with a stethoscope around his neck, and insisted that the elderly residents address him as \\"Herr Doktor.\\"  Murders In the four-month period from September 1914 to January 1915, 17 residents‚Äîan unusually high number‚Äîdied at the Home. Fearing foul play, the administration called the police in to investigate. Mors had used arsenic and chloroform to murder at least eight of the elderly residents. He later claimed he was \\"putting them out of their misery\\". He committed his first murder using arsenic, purchased from a local druggist. Encountering some difficulties with this method, he later switched to the use of chloroform.  Investigation  Early in the investigation, police learned of the fear the elderly patients and staff had of Mors. On these grounds he soon became the primary suspect of the investigation. When questioned, Mors readily and calmly admitted to killing eight of the seventeen patients who had recently died. He claimed that these were mercy killings and that they had been nuisances. In detail, he described his method as: > First I would pour a drop or two of chloroform on a piece of absorbent > cotton and hold it to the nostrils of the old person. Soon my man would > swoon. Then I would close the orifices of the body with cotton, stuffing it > in the ears, nostrils and so on. Next I would pour a little chloroform down > the throat and prevent the fumes escaping the same way. Mors also claimed that the home's superintendent had encouraged him to kill the more ill and more elderly patients. The district attorney declined to prosecute Mors, finding him to be criminally insane, and committed him to the Hudson River State Hospital, pending deportation to Austria. Mors escaped from the institution in May 1916. His later fate is unknown.

It grew out of classes offered at the Battle Creek Sanitarium. It existed from 1895 until 1910. It also ran classes in Chicago, Illinois. In the latter year it was merged with Illinois State University. Philosophy and Objectives Education of Medical Missionaries \\"The American Medical Missionary College, with a full and thorough course of study in medicine and a corps of efficient instructors, and being incorporated under the laws of Illinois, prepared to issue diplomas to those who should satisfactorily complete the course, was the first medical missionary college established, and, as far as we know, is the only one at present in existence which has exclusively for its purpose the education of medical missionaries, unless Dr. Valentine's medical school in North India may be an exception...\\" Review and Herald, July 29, 1902, p. 8 Free tuition \\"By action of the Sanitarium board, it was agreed that if the physicians employed in the Sanitarium would undertake to fill the position of professors, without salaries, the board would undertake to meet the incidental running expenses, so as to make the school a free school for all who were ready to devote their lives to the relief of suffering humanity, and to the propagation of the principles of the greater gospel, which offers salvation for the body as well as for the soul.\\" Review and Herald, July 29, 1902, p. 9 Non-sectarian Kellogg intended for the American Medical Missionary College to be non-sectarian in its teaching and clinical work. This meant that the distinctive Seventh-day Adventist doctrinal views would not be promoted at the institution. Others, in Adventist leadership, strongly disagreed with Dr. Kellogg on this (citation to be added.) In 1897, Dr. Kellogg described the AMMC's philosophy: \\"No students are received except those who have dedicated their lives to medical missionary work, and are under the supervision of some properly constituted missionary board. The institution, although Christian, is not sectarian, but is intensely evangelical. Sectarian doctrines are not included in its curriculum, and the benefits of its work are not confined within denominational lines.\\" The Christian Educator, September and October, 1897, p. 14 History The Movement to Train Medical Missionaries Before 1885 = Common Features of Medical Missionary Societies: They focused on sending out properly trained Christian medical doctors to serve as missionaries. They provided accommodation and financing for students as they worked on their medical education. They held a high standard of Christian commitment for their students. The Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society In 1841, a group of doctors formed the Edinburgh Association for Sending Medical Aid to Foreign Countries to 'circulate information on medical mission; help other institutions engaged in the same work and assist as many Missionary stations as their funds would permit.' The name of the association was changed in 1843 to The Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society ‚Äì a name which lasted until 2002 when it was split into two separate Charities - EMMS International and The Nazareth Trust.\\" On August 12, 1875, The Christian, a weekly periodical, in a section entitled 'Medical Missions' reported a growing interest in medical mission work. At a recent Mildmay Conference they reported on a speech by Dr. Saunders, of the London Medical Mission. In his opening remarks Saunders spoke of the ready access a medical missionary has to classes from which the clergyman and other evangelistic labourers are ordinarily excluded. Saunders said that people from Birmingham, Liverpool, Paris, Madrid, and Eastern Africa all have requested the help of medical missionaries. The Christian also reported on a talk given by Mr. Meacham, Superintendent of the Medical Mission in Manchester, England. Meacham said that medical missionaries were able to go down into the deeper depths of sin and misery than other people could. Their medical knowledge gave them insight into the spiritual state of their patients. This allowed them to win confidence and awaken conviction, and then to lead them to become Christians. Another speaker at the same conference, Rev. J. Lowe, Superintendent of the Medical Mission Training Institute, Edinburgh, told of his work in Travancore. When in India himself, he would see as many as 200 at a time on the verandah of his bungalow. He said that in the waiting room of the Mission Medical Dispensary, caste broke down. The Brahman, Sudra, and Pariah, the worshipper of Brahma, Siva, and Vishnu, the Protestant and the Roman Catholic, all stand together, side by side, listening to the medical missionaries tell the stories of Jesus. In Edinburgh fifty young men had been trained for medical mission work. They had been sent out by various missionary societies. It was proposed that a Livingstone Medical Mission Memorial should be erected in Edinburgh, in the form of a training institute.The Christian, A Weekly Record of Christian Life, Christian Testimony and Christian Work. Volume for 1875. London: Morgan and Scott, 12, Paternoster Buildings, Thursday, August 12, 1875, p. 589. The New York Medical Missionary Society \\"THE WORK OF THE NEW YORK MEDICAL MISSIONARY SOCIETY. \\"We have received a courteous letter from Dr. George D. Dowkontt, of this city, Medical Superintendent of the New York Medical Missionary \\"Home and Institute,\\" regarding the subject of \\"specially trained medical missionaries,\\" to which we referred in our issue of March 6. Dr. Dowkontt pleads the cause of the specially educated medical missionary. The great need of medical and surgical aid in heathen lands, and the great missionary value of such aid, are referred to, while the scarcity of men both willing and fitted to go is insisted upon. It was for these reasons that the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society was founded in 1841, and the New York Medical Missionary Society in 1881. The peculiar need for the existence of the latter society, we are told, lies in the fact that medical missionaries must be particularly well educated medically, and American medical colleges are not good enough, and do not furnish sufficient training. Our correspondent adds: \\" 'Allow me to say, in conclusion, that there is great force in the suggestion you made, that we could well spare two thousand out of the four thousand physicians annually graduated in America; and this is forcibly shown in the fact that while in 1880 there was one doctor to 585 people in the United States, there was only one medical missionary to nearly ten millions of the heathen. \\" 'You observe that these could well be spared to go forth and disseminate the gospel. Would to God they were able and willing so to do, then we need not exist; but they must first possess this gospel in their own hearts and lives to be able to disseminate it, and they must further be actuated by the spirit of self-denial which characterized the Great Physician for body and soul, the Lord Jesus Christ, before they will be willing to do so. \\" 'Thank God for the noble men of our profession who have gone forth to heathen lands, as Scudder to India, Parker to China, Livingstone to Africa, and Post to Syria, but oh! for more such men who are willing rather to live to give, than to get. \\" 'At the same time, I would not overlook the good work done by Christian physicians at home, work seldom recognized at its full worth, such as our late President, Dr. Alfred C. Post, and others.\\" Medical Record, A Weekly Journal of Medicine and Surgery Volume 29 edited by George Frederick Shrady, Thomas Lathrop Stedman, April 10, 1886, p. 419. New York, William Wood and Company. Dr. Gordon D. Dowkontt Dr. Gordon D. Dowkontt established the New York Medical Missionary Society and then the International Medical Missionary Society. These societies provided housing and financial sponsorships for medical students attending medical school. The purpose was to send out medical doctors as trained missionaries to serve anywhere in the world. Dr. Kellogg's similar efforts with students from the Sanitarium suggest that he was aware of Dr. Dowkontt's enterprise. Later, Dr. Dowkontt managed Kellogg's American Medical Missionary College. The Dowkontt's promotion of non-denominational mission work seems to have influenced Dr. Kellogg to do the same. (citation to be added) = 1885 - 1895 = 1890, The Sanitarium Medical Missionary School In November 1891, Good Health reported: \\"THE Sanitarium Medical Missionary School for the training of young men and women to act as missionary canvassers, teachers of cooking- schools, physical culture, lecturers on hygiene, and in similar lines of work, opened November 2, with nearly fifty students, a much larger number than has appeared at the opening on any previous occasion. The eminently practical character of the instruction given in the school, and the success with which the efforts of those who have taken the course of instruction in the two previous sessions have been attended, have developed an increasing interest in the work of this educational institution. It is very satisfactory to know that those who are taking the course the present year, are all, without exception, prepared to devote their whole energies to the work as soon as they have acquired a proper preparation for it.\\" Good Health, November, 1891, p. 37 In 1891, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg arranged for qualified students connected to the Battle Creek Sanitarium to take medical training at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He provided these sponsored students with a residence home under the care of D. H. and Loretta Kress. \\"THE editor (J. H. Kellogg) recently visited the Sanitarium Medical Class at Ann Arbor. He found there a happy family of medical students, numbering nearly twenty, all enjojing good health, evidently prospering in their studies, and enjoying greatly the opportunities for preparing themselves for future usefulness. The friends of sanitary reform have great expectations respecting the young men and women who constitute this class, and when their course of study is completed, they will be warmly welcomed to the ranks of workers in the cause of sanitary and hygienic reform, which is very sadly in need of recruits. \\" The Agra Medical Missionary Training Institute under the leadership of Dr. Colin S. Valentine provided similar accommodations for native students in Agra, India. In 1886, Dr. P.T. Wilson wrote: \\"For more than three years I have had charge of the Agra Medical Missionary Training Institution, which simply gives a Christian home to native Christian young men who come to Agra to pursue a course in the Government Agra Medical School. At present we have ten students who avail themselves of this home. During the past year the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society has taken over this Institution and Rev. Dr. Colin S. Valentine is expected to return from furlough and assume charge in the autumn.\\" The Gospel in all Lands: Representing the Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church and also other churches and societies (1886) p. 526. Publisher: A.D.F. Randolph. = 1895 - 1902 = The Illinois legislature granted a charter to The American Medical Missionary College in 1895. The American Medical Missionary College taught students both in Battle Creek and in Chicago. The Chicago education took place in conjunction with the Chicago Medical Mission. = 1903 - 1910 = Dr. Kellogg and the Seventh-day Adventist Church experienced serious difficulties with each other. Kellogg was no longer a member of the church after 1907. After Battle Creek College moved to Berrien Springs in 1901/1902, many Seventh-day Adventists stopped sending their young people to Battle Creek for an education. The lack of Seventh-day Adventist support affected both the attendance and the financial support for the College. The AMMC declined in enrollment and developed significant debts. Yet, in 1908, the following news item appeared in the November issue of the Missionary Review of the World. The Review and Herald presented it as a news quote: \\" 'The Battle Creek Sanitarium, with which this college [the American Medical Missionary College] under Dr. George D. Dowkontt (See New York Medical Missionary Society quote above.) is connected, has severed its connection with the Seventh-day Adventists, and Dr. Kellogg is no longer a member of that body.

Taq polymerase has a nontemplate-dependent terminal transferase activity that adds a single deoxyadenosine (A) to the 3'-end of the PCR products. This characteristic is exploited in \\"sticky end\\" TOPO TA cloning. For \\"blunt end\\" TOPO cloning, the recipient vector does not have overhangs and blunt-ended DNA fragments can be cloned.  Principle  The technique utilises the inherent biological activity of DNA topoisomerase I. The biological role of topoisomerase is to cleave and rejoin supercoiled DNA ends to facilitate replication. Vaccinia virus topoisomerase I specifically recognises DNA sequence 5¬¥-(C/T)CCTT-3'. During replication, the enzyme digests DNA specifically at this sequence, unwinds the DNA and re-ligates it again at the 3' phosphate group of the thymidine base. \\"Sticky end\\" TOPO TA cloning  TOPO vectors are designed in such a way that they carry this specific sequence 5¬¥-(C/T)CCTT-3' at the two linear ends. The linear vector DNA already has the topoisomerase enzyme covalently attached to both of its strands' free 3' ends. This is then mixed with PCR products. When the free 5' ends of the PCR product strands attach to the topoisomerase/3' end of each vector strand, the strands are covalently linked by the already bound topoisomerase. This reaction proceeds efficiently when this solution is incubated at room temperature with required salt. Different types of vectors are used for cloning fragments amplified by either Taq or Pfu polymerase as Taq polymerase (unlike Pfu) leaves an extra \\"A\\" nucleotide at the 3'end during amplification. The TA TOPO cloning technique relies on the ability of adenine (A) and thymine (T) (complementary basepairs) on different DNA fragments to hybridize and, in the presence of ligase or topoisomerase, become ligated together. The insert is created by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase, a polymerase that lacks 3' to 5' proofreading activity and with a high probability adds a single, 3'-adenine overhang to each end of the PCR product. It is best if the PCR primers have guanines at the 5' end as this maximizes probability of Taq DNA polymerase adding the terminal adenosine overhang. Thermostable polymerases containing extensive 3¬¥ to 5¬¥ exonuclease activity should not be used as they do not leave the 3¬¥ adenine-overhangs. The target vector is linearized and cut with a blunt-end restriction enzyme. This vector is then tailed with dideoxythymidine triphosphate (ddTTP) using terminal transferase. It is important to use ddTTP to ensure the addition of only one T residue. This tailing leaves the vector with a single 3'-overhanging thymine residue on each blunt end. \\"Blunt end\\" TOPO cloning Polymerases (such as Phusion) or restriction enzymes that produce blunt ends can also be used for TOPO cloning. Rather than relying on sticky ends, the blunt end TOPO vector has blunt ends where the topoisomerase molecules are bound. Commercial kits, such as the Zero Blunt¬Æ Cloning Kit from Invitrogen, are available.

In the end of the 1970s, as part of the HaMitzpim program, a temporary camp was erected for workers who were building moshavim nearby. The remnants of buildings that were used in the camp were improved by members of the community when they went to live there on Yom Ha'atzmaut in May 1994.

After the Italians left, Cochin Jews arrived from India. By 1968, Alma's inhabitants were mostly from Libya and Tunisia. The economy is based on hillculture (vineyards, deciduous fruit, vegetables) and cattle. In its early years of development, Alma was associated with Hapoel HaMizrachi. Archaeology Near the moshav's cemetery lie the remnants of what has been identified as a synagogue, perhaps dating to the 3rd century, though it has never been systematically excavated or properly researched. Also nearby are several tombs, including those of two prominent Sages (tannaim) of the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, one belonging to Eleazar ben Arach, and one which is traditionally recognized as Eliezer ben Hurcanus' tomb.

He is a founding member and one fourth of Chicago rap group the Beatmonstas which consists of himself and fellow rappers Noble Dru, Therapy & Diamond Back. He is also a member of rap group Sac.Fly. He was born and raised on Chicago's West Side. He attended Lake View High School on Chicago's North Side. He went on to attend Columbia College in Downtown Chicago where he began frequenting Chicago's underground hip-hop scene. The name Phashara is a mash-up of three names that he used during his formative younger emcee years. At a time when rap music was afro centric Phashara sported ‚ÄúPharaoh‚Äù as his stage name. Shortly thereafter, he and a group of friends began to study Islam at which time Phashara toyed with the idea of legally changing his name to Shaquell Rashid. Eventually settling on an amalgamation of the three names by using the first few letters each, Phashara was born. Phashara's profile grew in the 90's as a part of Chicago-based rap group Sac.Fly. The group included rappers Phashara & Bosa and producer / DJ Trust. The group recorded several LPs between 1993 and 1999. The LPs were never officially released to the public. SAC.FLY parted ways by 2000. Eventually, Phashara began to produce his own music in pursuit of a solo career. As Phashara prepped his debut solo LP for release, he joined forces with Noble Dru, Diamond Back & Therapy to form the group Beatmonstas and subsequently the label, Beatmonstas Entertainment. Shortly thereafter, Phashara and Noble Dru launched the label with a compilation release rather than a solo release which gave way to ‚ÄúThe 3rd Weapon‚Äù. The 3rd Weapon was licensed from Beatmonstas Entertainment for distribution in the UK & Ireland by Mindlab Recordings / Southern Record Distributors in 2006. In July 2008, Phashara's debut solo project ‚ÄúThe Storybook Adventure‚Äù was released independently on Beatmonstas Entertainment. The Storybook Adventure features production by Phashara himself, Radius (Neighborhood Suicide, LP), Noble Dru (The 3rd Weapon, LP) & Tall Black Guy (Path Finders, 80's Babies).

Distribution Layia discoidea is a local serpentine endemic where it is known only from the Diablo Range in southern San Benito County and far western Fresno County. The known distribution of the species is the New Idria serpentine mass (BLM Clear Creek Management Area) and nearby Laguna Mountain, Hepsedam Peak, and Panther Peak serpentine masses. Layia discoidea is regarded as a strict serpentine endemic with several populations known (as of 2017) to occur on greywacke and chert outcrop and talus at the edge of the New Idria Serpentine Mass near Condon Peak, Sampson Peak, and Idria Reservoir. Typical habitat of the species is serpentine rock outcrop, serpentine talus, and serpentine stream terraces where it grows in full sun with little to no competition from other plant species. The shale and chert outcrop habitat that a few populations of Layia discoidea grows on has similar (analogous) physical and microclimate conditions as the serpentine habitat that the species is primarily found growing. Description This is an annual herb growing a small glandular stem to a maximum height of about 20 centimeters. The thin leaves are generally lance-shaped, but the larger leaves on the lower part of the stem are usually lobed. Unlike other Layia species, which are known for their prominent white or yellow ray florets, Layia discoidea has no ray florets or real phyllaries. The flower head is a cluster of many deep yellow disc florets with a base of bractlike scales. The fruit is an achene with a short scaly brown pappus. =Speciation= Genetic analysis performed on this species suggest that it evolved directly from Layia glandulosa in what may be an example of both allopatric speciation and peripatric speciation.Baldwin, B. G. (2005). Origin of the serpentine-endemic herb Layia discoidea from the widespread L. glandulosa (Compositae). Evolution 59:11 2473-79. Layia discoidea looks quite different from the white-rayed Layia glandulosa, and it lives in a specialized habitat, but the two species are genetically very similar and produce robust, fertile hybrids when crossed.Gottlieb, L. D., S. I. Warwick and V. S. Ford. (1985). Morphological and electrophoretic divergence between Layia discoidea and L. glandulosa. Systematic Botany 10:4 484-95. Known extant Layia glandulosa populations within the range of Layia discoidea typically have deep yellow ray florets. Individuals of Layia discoidea occasionally display ray florets that are light yellow in color (see Calphotos and Harrison 2013). Individuals bearing ray florets have been observed in populations at the New Idria, Laguna Mountain, and Panther Peak serpentine masses. It is unclear if the ray florets are a result of hybridization with nearby Layia glandulosa, a genetic mutation, or simply induced by environmental conditions. References Harrison SP. 2013.

In a fancy nightclub he finds Charles Engle, a man ridden by guilt and on the brink of committing suicide after embezzling a large sum of money that he has spent on his high-maintenance wife. Charles has the appearance of a common hillbilly from out of town visiting the city and Bill decides to scam him for his money. Bill is unaware that the desperate Charles only has until 6 am to pay back the money he has embezzled before the crime is discovered. One of the showgirls at the club, Nina Barona, is persuaded by Bill to help trick Charles into entering a poker game to win back the money. The game is arranged by a gangster named Dutch Enright. Another disillusioned man at the club, playwright Gene Gibbons, learns about Charles's misfortune from the suicide note he discovers in his coat, and wants to write the man a story with a happier ending. He tries to get a valuable brooch from his ex-girlfriend, to give to Charles so that he can get the money, but his plan fails because the brooch is a cheap copy. Instead he overhears Bill telling of his poker scam against Charles, and persuades Bill to change the plan so that Charles wins the first rounds and is allowed to escape from the game after that. A deal is made, that Bill gets whatever Charles wins over the $3,000 he needs to pay the money back. However, Gene passes out while waiting for the game to start, and when he wakes up he does not remember the deal he made with Bill, but goes home to his wife. Bill discovers that Gene is gone, and Dutch finds out about Charles's planned escape, and tries to stop him. Nina convinces Bill to do the right thing and help fend off Dutch's men when they try to get Charles and the money back. Bill is changed by his discovery that behaving honorably has a positive effect on him; he falls in love with Nina, who returns his feelings. Thus they get a happy ending of their own.

He served in World War II as a Navy fighter pilot and worked as a special agent for the FBI. He gained notability due to his service in the Navy as a Legal Specialist, where, as chief counsel to the Naval Board of Inquiry investigating the 1967 Israeli attack on the USS Liberty that killed 34 crewmen and injured 172, he personally concluded that the attack was most likely deliberate. He stated the court was ordered by superiors to ascribe the attack to an accident, rather than to deliberate hostility. In 2002 Boston told the Navy Times that the naval court was a politicized sham with conclusions preordained to exonerate Israel. In a signed affidavit he stated that U.S. President Lyndon Johnson and U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara had ordered the President of the Court, Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, Jr., that the assault be ruled an accident, and to reach the conclusion \\"that the attack was a case of 'mistaken identity'\\" despite \\"overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\\" He said he felt compelled to make this information public following the publication of the book The Liberty Incident by bankruptcy judge A. Jay Cristol, which concluded the attack was unintentional, while Boston found that the attack was most likely deliberate. In early 2004, Boston repeated the revelation before a State Department conference about the Six-Day War. In 2007, Cristol suggested that another individual helped Boston with his initial affidavit and declaration, and very likely wrote or assisted in the preparation of a June 8, 2007 article; he claimed this was part of a much broader propaganda effort emanating from \\"a small but well-funded and very vocal group of people and organizations principally supported by Saudi Arabian money\\".

Their first patient transport took place July 18, 1979, a horrific vehicle accident on Hwy 37 in Morgan County. Since that time, IU Health LifeLine has transported more than 50,000 accident-free patient transports. LifeLine is a combined program, providing comprehensive services to all age groups. The Adult/Pediatric crews (5) consist of a Pilot, Flight Nurse, and Flight Paramedic. The Neonatal/Pediatric crews (4) are based out of Indianapolis and consist of a Pilot, Registered Nurse, Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT), and/or Neonatal Nurse Practitioner and focus on critically ill children and newborns. Additionally, specialty crew members (RN or MD) are utilized for high-risk OB transports, ECMO, and surgeon field response transports. All medical crew members are required to maintain certifications pertinent to their scope of practice (CFRN, FP-C, CCRN, RRT- NPS). LifeLine helicopters fly throughout the State of Indiana. LifeLine's fleet consists of one MBB/Kawasaki BK 117 and five Eurocopter EC 145 twin- engine helicopters with an average cruise speed of 150 miles per hour. Every aircraft is equipped with Garmin GNS530 Nav/Com/GPS systems, TAWS/TCAS, weather radar, night vision goggles, and satellite phone capabilities. LifeLine is also an instrument flight rule (IFR) program which expands their response capabilities by enabling them to complete missions in weather conditions below visual flight rule (VFR) minimums. Each outlying base (Lafayette, Terre Haute, Columbus, and New Castle) operate an adult Mobile Intensive Care Unit or MICU driven by EMT's when meteorological conditions/IFR do not permit air medical transport or when patient condition does not require air medical transport. LifeLine utilizes the most up-to-date, state of the art equipment available, including: Zoll X series monitors, Hamilton T-1 ventilators, Maquet intra aortic balloon pumps (IABP), and iStat blood analyzer. LifeLine was the first air transport provider in the state to carry blood products. They carry two units of O-negative blood and two units of plasma on every mission; they have provided this service since 1996. Partnering with IU Health Methodist Trauma Services, an additional benefit being utilized is field trauma surgeons. This program enables trauma surgeons to respond to the scene of an accident involving prolonged extrication. Once on scene, they can perform life saving surgical procedures for extended entrapments or farm/industrial machinery injuries and then continue care during transport.

His aim was to mix German operetta with exotic ingredients such as jazz, \\"negro music\\" and \\"the most enchanting Dancing-Girls with divine legs\\", in order to show that revue made in Berlin could be \\"as contemporary as the jazz band, that turns the Siegmund- jodeling and Siegfried-screaching to laughter\\" and is \\"as modern as Mozart or the mini-automobile\\", as Charell's personal friend and PR genius Alfred Flechtheim phrased it in the 1924 article \\"Vom Ballet zur Revue\\" in the magazine Der Querschnitt. \\"Charell wants us to witness the many different facets from all around the world‚Äù.Flechtheim, Alfred, ‚ÄûVom Ballett zur Revue‚Äú, in: Alfred Flechtheim: ¬ªNun mal Schlu√ü mit den blauen Picassos!¬´. S√§mtliche Schriften, published by Rudolf Schmitt-F√∂ller, Bonn, Weidle Verlag 2010, p. 210-215. http://www.ralph- benatzky.com/main.php?cat=4‚äÇ_cat=10&task;=3&art;_id=000333 This show was followed by the revues F√ºr Dich (1925) and Von Mund zu Mund (1926), which were arranged by composer Ralph Benatzky and contained music by Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern and many others. After the series of revues, Charell began adapting classic operettas such as The Mikado, ', Madame Pompadour and Die lustige Witwe and turned them into modern jazzy revue operettas, claiming that he needed a plot line for his show, that had been missing in the pure revues before. A few years later, he decided to create his very own operettas with composer Ralph Benatzky. Together they wrote the trilogy of historical revue- operettas, which made Charell famous to this day: Casanova (1928), ' (1929) and The White Horse Inn (Im wei√üen R√∂√ül, 1930). Especially The White Horse Inn was one of the most successful creations of Charell's career. In the following years he himself staged the show in London (1931), Paris (1932) and New York (1936), where each production was newly conceived, the script translated differently, and new music and instrumentation were added in some parts. Many actors and singers, such as Marlene Dietrich, Joseph Schmidt, Max Hansen and Camilla Spira, who all became famous later, first appeared in major roles in Charell productions. Charell also discovered the boy group Comedian Harmonists and presented them for the first time in Casanova at the Gro√üe Schauspielhaus. The reaction of the international press was positive, the New York Times noting that ‚ÄúErik Charell seems to have done it again. 'Casanova', his latest operetta production at the Grosses Schauspielhaus, is filling this huge circus to its stylized rafters‚Äù.Trask, C. Hooper, ‚ÄúBut the Germans Like It‚Äù, in: The New York Times, November 4, 1928 http://www.ralph- benatzky.com/main.php?cat=4‚äÇ_cat=10&task;=3&art;_id=000093 After this string of stage successes, Charell moved on to the new and innovative genre of sound film operetta. In 1931, Universum Film AG (Ufa) producer Erich Pommer invited Charell to direct Der Kongre√ü tanzt, (sets by Ernst Stern, music by Werner Richard Heymann), one of the most successful films of the early era of sound film, with one review in the New York Times saying that ‚Äú[it] is a stupendous pictorial film. [‚Ä¶] it is [‚Ä¶] an exceptional film entertainment. The director, Erik Charell, is the Ziegfeld of the German musical comedy stage‚ÄùMovie review in: The New York Times, November 22, 1931. https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9906EFD71131E13ABC4A51DFB767838A629EDE and another noting that ‚ÄúIt is a charming spectacle of Vienna in 1814, filled with tuneful melodies that one likes to remember and blessed with pleasing light comedy‚Äù.Hall, Mordaunt, ‚ÄúDer Kongress Tanzt (1931)‚Äù, in: The New York Times, May 12, 1932. https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D06E5D9153EE633A25751C1A9639C946394D6CF The international success of Der Kongre√ü tanzt led to an engagement in Hollywood, where Charell directed the movie Caravan, again with sets by Ernst Stern and music by Werner Richard Heymann. When the Nazis took over in January 1933, the Ufa immediately annulled their contract with Charell because of his Jewish descent. They also cancelled all plans for two further contractually agreed upon film projects, one a film operetta based on the Odyssey with Hans Albers in the male lead. Three years later a German court even sentenced Charell to return the 26.000 Reichsmark, which had been paid to him as an advance.‚ÄúThe fictitious death of a non-arian‚Äù, in: Pariser Tageszeitung, October 3, 1937. When Caravan flopped in the US and internationally, his Hollywood career and all other American film projects came to an immediate halt. The New York Times noted ‚ÄúIf lyric loveliness and photographic charm were all a picture needed to keep an audience enthralled, Mr. Charell could be toasted in good tokay this morning, and 'Caravan' could be applauded until the bottle is dry. But the sober fact is that the new film is an exceptionally tedious enterprise‚Äù.Sennwald, Andre, \\"Caravan\\", in: The New York Times, September 28, 1934. https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D03E5DC123FE53ABC4051DFBF66838F629EDE One of the cancelled projects was a film about ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). It would have been an interesting project, since Charell in his dancing days was often compared by the German press to Nijinsky. In 1936, Charell staged a successful Broadway production of White Horse Inn. The New York Times noted that it ‚Äúinvolves mountain scenery and hotel architecture, costumes beautiful and varied enough to bankrupt a designer's imagination, choruses that can do anything from the hornpipe to a resounding slap-dance, grand processionals with royalty loitering before the commoners, a steamboat, a yacht, a char-√†-banc, four real cows and a great deal more of the same. Indeed, the enthusiasm with which 'White Horse Inn' has been created has virtually transformed the enormous Center Theatre into a Tyrol village‚Äù.Atkinson, Brooks, With Horse Inn', an Elaborate Musical Show, Opens the Season in Rockefeller City\\", in: The New York Times, October 2, 1936. http://www.ralph-benatzky.com/main.php?task=30&page;=6&art;_id=000069 The Daily Mirror mentioned that ‚Äúit is difficult to give you an idea of the immensity of 'White Horse Inn'. It is gargantuan. It is the Queen Mary of extravaganzas. [‚Ä¶] It boasts acres of settings, hundreds of performers. It is a grand and glittering sight for the eyes.‚ÄùColeman, Robert, ‚ÄúWhite Horse Inn‚Äù, in: The Daily Mirror, October 2, 1936. http://www.ralph- benatzky.com/main.php?task=30&page;=8&art;_id=000040 There was even talk of a film version with Eddie Cantor as the head waitor. (Warner Brothers were co- producers of the Broadway staging.) Spurred by the success of White Horse Inn, Charell adapted Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream as a jazz operetta and presented it as Swinging the Dream on Broadway at the Center Theatre in 1939.Berg, Marita, ‚Äú ¬ªDet Jesch√§ft ist richtig!¬´ Die Revueoperetten des Erik Charell‚Äú, in: Musik-Konzepte, Heft 133/134. Im wei√üen R√∂ssl. Zwischen Kunst und Kommerz, published by Ulrich Tadday, edition text + kritik in Richard Boorberg Verlag, 2006, p. 76-77. It was a daring and innovative production, because Charell used only black actors and singers, including Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Maxine Sullivan, Moms Mabley, Dorothy Dandridge and Butterfly McQueen. Furthermore, the stage sets were based on Walt Disney motifs. The music was written by Jimmy van Heusen, Benny Goodman conducted his own band and the choreography was by Agnes de Mille. But the production closed after only 13 performances, mainly because white Broadway audiences at the time were not ready for an all-black cast. A review in the New York Times described the show as a ‚Äúnegro carnival‚Äù, noting that ‚Äúbetween Shakespeare and Goodman, Goodman wins‚Äù.Atkinson, Brooks, \\"Swingin' Shakespeare's Dream\\", in: The New York Times, November 30, 1939. After the war, Charell returned to Europe. In Munich he had a big success with the musical comedy Feuerwerk (music by Paul Burkhard) at the Staatstheater am G√§rtnerplatz. The song O mein Papa became an international hit. In the 1950s, Charell created a stage version of Der Kongre√ü tanzt, which was performed in France, but the French public was not enthusiastic. His two big film productions were The White Horse Inn with Nazi operetta star Johannes Heesters in 1952, and Fireworks with Lilli Palmer and the young Romy Schneider in 1954. After failing to write a sequel to The White Horse Inn with his original librettist Robert Gilbert, Charell spend most of his time of the 1960s buying and selling art. Together with his brother Ludwig he owned a collection of Toulouse-Lautrec-lithographs, which was exhibited in Canada in 1953https://www.gallery.ca/en/see/exhibitions/events/exhibition_details/1466/lang:en and in other major museums of the world. In 1969 he received the German movie prize, the Filmband in Gold, for his ‚Äúexcellent works and outstanding contributions to the history of the German movie‚Äù. He died on July 15, 1974 in Munich and was cremated on the Eastern cemetery. In his obituary it says: ‚Äú28 friends gave him the last farewell in the city, to which he had a special love. A movie producer spoke to his memories, and to honour this charmer, who consciously and prudently managed his graceful talents, the triumph march of Verdi's opera 'Aida' sounded across the cemetery‚Äù.Drews, Wolfgang, ‚ÄûLetzter Gru√ü f√ºr Eric [sic] Charell‚Äú, in: Tagesspiegel, July 24, 1974. The urn was interred in a cemetery in Gr√ºnwald near Munich. Charell's partner Friedrich Zanner and Dr. Wolf Schwarz, a lawyer and friend, were appointed to manage the estate and the personal property.Reports of Deaths of American Citizens Abroad, 1960, 1963-1974 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2009. His collection of Lautrec-lithographs was sold by Sotheby's in 1978. The Schwules Museum Berlin dedicated an exhibition to Charell and his work from July 7 to September 27, 2010. It was curated by Kevin Clarke. On 18 November 2015, Friedrichstadt-Palast Berlin inaugurated a memorial at Friedrichstra√üe 107 dedicated to the theatre‚Äôs founders, Max Reinhardt, Hans Poelzig and Erik Charell. Memorial plaque at Friedrichstra√üe 107 in Mitte-Berlin. Nudity on stage When Charell visited New York for the first time, working at the Century Theatre for Max Reinhardt, he was impressed and inspired by the American revues, especially the Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway. He decided, upon his return to Berlin, to combine European operetta music with the music and ideas of the American music theatre, to create a more 'cosmopolitan German' style. He established a revue style in which ‚Äúword, sound, image, costume, colour, the art of illumination [work together] as a single rousing burning mirror‚Äù.Berg, Marita, ‚Äú ¬ªDet Jesch√§ft ist richtig!¬´ Die Revueoperetten des Erik Charell‚Äú, in: Musik-Konzepte, Heft 133/134. Im wei√üen R√∂ssl. Zwischen Kunst und Kommerz, published by Ulrich Tadday, edition text + kritik in Richard Boorberg Verlag, 2006, p. 61-69. Charell wanted to make ‚Äúmodern‚Äù pieces and bring them to Germany to challenge the conservative mindset, which still prevailed in Europe after the First World War (‚ÄúGermany is still suffering from the blockage. After being isolated from the rest of the world for ten years, it finally needs to breathe freely and realize what was going on in those ten long years, not only in science [‚Ä¶], but also in things, which take a look on the bright side of life‚Äù).Flechtheim, Alfred, ‚ÄûVom Ballett zur Revue‚Äú, in: Der Querschnitt: Facsimile Querschnitt durch den Querschnitt 1921-1936, published by Wilmont Haacke and Alexander von Baeyer, Frankfurt am Maain/Berlin/Wien, 1977. His way of using contemporary syncopated music ‚Äì from the German charts and the USA (the first European performance of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue took place within Charell's first revue, An Alle) ‚Äì,the risqu√© jokes and the inclusion of attractive boy groups (dancing and singing) in addition to the then standard heterosexual display of female nudity were all new to the Berlin theatre scene. He also presented renowned Lesbian stars such as Claire Waldoff to draw in additional crowds. Especially the sexually provocative sketches between the songs made his reviews and revue operettas famous. The comedians Claire Waldoff and Wilhelm Bendow were hired to perform slapstick and dialectic humour similar of the likes of Charlie Chaplin and Karl Valentin. They provided an ironic view on different topics and cheeky 'hidden' references to e.g. sex practices of heteros and homosexuals. Besides, there were also jokes about sexuality woven into the song texts by the lyricists. This made the heterosexual audience laugh, especially those who understood the insider jokes, and it especially catered to the homosexual crowd. Bendow was particularly famous for his camp acting and double entendres. Furthermore, on Charell used sexually suggestive imagery, like in Von Mund zu Mund in which ancient Roman soldiers were portrayed semi-naked holding lances and swords.Flechtheim, Alfred, ‚ÄûVom Ballett zur Revue‚Äú, in: Der Querschnitt: Facsimile Querschnitt durch den Querschnitt 1921-1936, published by Wilmont Haacke and Alexander von Baeyer, Frankfurt am Maain/Berlin/Wien, 1977. Charell revolutionized the German musical theatre by developing the idea of 'staged nudity' further than had been standard until then. He discovered modern female chorus lines in New York and was the first to bring them to Berlin, where they fuelled his stunning success. When the other theatre managers tried to copy Charell and also hired female chorus groups, they presented them as nude as possible. While the fight over who had the 'most naked' women in Berlin was raging, Charell's staging of nudity moved into a wholly different direction: when the audience became tired and bored of a straightforward display of naked bodies (\\"Yes, we are all pretty tired of those flesh exhibitions. The audience is sated with thighs. Not to mention, how fed up we are of the mass display of female bosoms.\\"),Berg, Marita, ‚Äú ¬ªDet Jesch√§ft ist richtig!¬´ Die Revueoperetten des Erik Charell‚Äú, in: Musik-Konzepte, Heft 133/134. Im wei√üen R√∂ssl. Zwischen Kunst und Kommerz, published by Ulrich Tadday, edition text + kritik in Richard Boorberg Verlag, 2006, p. 61-69. he started to artfully arrange the nudity. Charell wanted ‚Äúto reawaken aesthetic feelings‚Äù in the spectator ‚Äúby artistic composition‚Äù.Berg, Marita, ‚Äú ¬ªDet Jesch√§ft ist richtig!¬´ Die Revueoperetten des Erik Charell‚Äú, in: Musik-Konzepte, Heft 133/134. Im wei√üen R√∂ssl. Zwischen Kunst und Kommerz, published by Ulrich Tadday, edition text + kritik in Richard Boorberg Verlag, 2006, p. 61-69. In addition and as a contrast to the omnipresent female nudity, Charell also hired boy groups, e.g. the Tyrolean dancers, the ‚ÄúSchuhplattler and Watschent√§nzer‚Äù, for Im wei√üen R√∂ssl, or the ‚ÄúJackson‚Äù and the ‚ÄúSunshine Boys‚Äù. In the first case homoeroticism is quite obvious, the tabloid newspaper BZ am Mittag noting ‚Äújuicy guys in leather trousers, who slap each other in time. [‚Ä¶] My God, they have the right cheeks for it!‚Äù Charell also used famous male sex symbols in his operettas, like Alfred Jerger, Max Hansen and Siegfried Arno, the latter doing a famous striptease in ' when comparing his battle wounds with the others, critic Erich Urban noted that ‚Äúwhen [Arno] unveils his perforated body to Hansen [‚Ä¶] the whole theatre screams and gasp, not just the upper balconies‚Äù.Flechtheim, Alfred, ‚ÄûVom Ballett zur Revue‚Äú, in: Der Querschnitt: Facsimile Querschnitt durch den Querschnitt 1921-1936, published by Wilmont Haacke and Alexander von Baeyer, Frankfurt am Maain/Berlin/Wien, 1977. Im wei√üen R√∂ssl contains a similar scene, in which Arno presents himself as a ‚Äúgorgeous bathing beauty‚Äù and undresses, before plunging into the Wolfgangsee. Even though Charell's revues were inspired by America and England, this kind of nudity and sexual liberation was only found in Berlin during the Roaring Twenties. After 1933, the Nazis suppressed such most of the sexual freedom in operetta, because it was seen as \\"Jewish\\" and \\"degenerate\\". Unfortunately, 1945 the German operetta scene never returned to the liberated ideals of the 1920s and adapted many of the famous shows from that era to fit the new 'innocent' style of the post-war period. This eventually led Charell to leave the theatre and film business entirely, and focus on his art collection instead.

It was founded by Bernie Glassman and his second wife Sandra Jishu Holmes in 1996, as a means of continuing the work begun with the Greyston Foundation in 1980 of expanding Zen practice into larger spheres of influence such as social services, business and ecology but with a greater emphasis on peace work. Eve Marko, Bernie Glassman‚Äôs third wife, is a founding teacher of the Zen Peacemaker Order. Zen Peacemakers have developed from the White Plum Asanga lineage of Taizan Maezumi. Tradition and lineage Although Zen Peacemakers are associated with the White Plum Asanga lineage, founder Bernie Glassman did not envisage it as an organization bound by traditional Japanese S≈çt≈ç Zen practice. Bernie Glassman has said: > Maezumi Roshi was not carrying out the tradition of the Japanese Soto sect > when he came here. The Soto sect of Japan was not carrying out the > traditions of Chinese Zen. You have to be careful with the word > 'traditional.' We honor a lot of eccentric people. Likewise, although within the lineage, the Zen Peacemaker Order was not formed as part of the White Plum Asanga organization. Links between the two organizations are now distant; despite being named as heir to the presidency of the White Plum Asanga in Maezumi's will, Glassman ceased attending the annual meetings of Taizan Maezumi's dharma heirs within a few years of his former teacher's death. According to the author James Ishmael Ford, as of 2006 Glassman has \\"transferred his leadership of the White Plum Asanga to his Dharma brother Merzel Roshi and has formally 'disrobed,' renouncing priesthood in favor of serving as a lay teacher and leader of what is now called the Zen Peacemaker Family.\\" Greyston Foundation Activities of the Zen Peacemakers originated in Yonkers, New York with the opening of the Greyston Bakery, its most well-known and prosperous project, in 1982. Its projects eventually united under the auspices of the Greyston Foundation, a network of community development companies and non-profit organizations based in the inner city. Greyston Family Inn opened in 1991, on proceeds from the sale of Greyston mansion. It provides permanent housing for homeless people, with a child day- care center amongst services available for residents. Currently, there are three buildings, providing fifty housing units. Other projects include the Greyston Garden Project, five community-run gardens established on neglected properties. In 1992 Greyston Health Services was formed, primarily to provide services for poor people with HIV/AIDS. In 1997 Issan House opened, named after Issan Dorsey a Zen Roshi who had died from an AIDS-related condition in 1990. It provides thirty-five permanent housing units for people living with both HIV/AIDS and mental illness or chemical dependency.KnowledgePlex: Issan House Supportive Housing Case Study-2004 MetLife Foundation Awards, 2004 The Maitri Day Program within the building provides a variety of health and rehabilitative service to 150 people with HIV/AIDS from the local community. As one of the first 'welfare to work' programs in the USA, in 2004 Greyston had an annual budget of over $20 million and received numerous government grants. At Yonkers, they occupy the former Ethan Flagg House-Blessed Sacrament Monastery, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. International In 1996 Bernie Glassman - with his wife Sandra Jishu Holmes - officially founded the Zen Peacemaker Order, later the Zen Peacemaker Circle and currently Zen Peacemakers. According to professor Christopher S. Queen, \\"The order is based on three principles: plunging into the unknown, bearing witness to the pain and joy of the world and a commitment to heal oneself and the world.\\" Zen Peacemaker projects have included a Paris soup kitchen for immigrants and non-violence efforts in the Palestinian territories, with joint Israeli-Palestinian peaceful coexistence projects in Israel. Zen Peacemakers in Poland established 'Nonviolent Communications Training and Practice' in the national public school system and opened an AIDS hospice. The Auschwitz project brought together families of the Holocaust survivors and the descendants of those who ran the camps to '\\"bear witness to the horrors of war\\" during retreats at the site of the former German concentration camp in Poland. In the United States, Zen Peacemakers have campaigned for prison reform, provided hospice care and worked with the poor in both inner-city and rural areas. Zen Peacemakers have 70 affiliate centers in 5 Continents and 12 Countries. Countries with groups affiliated to Zen Peacemakers include Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the UK. In the United States affiliates include the Upaya Institute and Zen Center led by Joan Halifax in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Elders and Spiritual Directors The founder Roshi Bernie Glassman has served as the spiritual director of Zen Peacemakers from its inception. In May 2005 Roshi Enkyo Pat O'Hara was ratified as Co-Spiritual Director by the Zen Peacemaker Board. Rami Efal serves as director of the Zen Peacemakers International organisation, acting as a 'hive' to collect and share ideas for the widespread community. In Europe, Cornelius Collande, Barbara Wegmueller, Michel DuBois, and Frank De Waele are among the elders of the Zen Peacemakers community and the Auschwitz Bearing Witness retreat. For the Zen Peacemaker Circles, the current coordinator in Europe is Kathleen Battke, who succeeded Barbara Wegmueller in the role, and in America, the longest-serving elder in Circle practice is Jeana Moore. Zen Peacemaker Sangha The structure of Zen Peacemakers is, like the Greyston Foundation, somewhat complex and also like Greyston is described as a mandala. The mandala is based on the Five Buddha Families with the intention that the organization addresses needs in all aspects of life. The Zen Peacemakers Sangha (ZPS) is a branch of the Zen Peacemakers Order. It is an association of groups founded by or led by seniors empowered by Bernie Glassman or groups who practice Zen and socially engaged Zen. The ZPS is a forum for sharing the diverse methods of practice, service and teaching within the Zen Peacemakers Order for the purpose of education and personal development as practitioners and teachers. The Mother House Formerly sited in Montague, Massachusetts, in the United States, the Mother House was the study and practice center of the Zen Peacemakers. The approach of the institute is based on the Japanese concept ', or \\"practice and study are not two\\". It provides various training paths, study programs, and hands-on internships. The Mother House hosted various programs including the Montague Farm Zendo, the Montague Farm Zen House and a residence program. The Mother House was foreclosed on in 2011 and sold to a private owner in 2012. Training and Spiritual practices The training of the Zen Peacemakers is grounded in traditional Zen practice - meditation, retreats, liturgy, personal study-relationships with empowered teachers - and also explores new forms and structures. Council circle, Nonviolent Communication, international Bearing Witness retreats, and \\"plunges\\" - immersing oneself in unfamiliar situations, often connected with social action, which requires the participant to let go of what they know and responds in new ways - have come to form core elements of the training throughout the network of practitioners. Glassman trained in clowning as a personal plunge, visiting war zones, and performing for the children. In his later years, Glassman disrobed from the priesthood to develop lay zen practice, following the tradition of his heart teacher Koryu Osaka Roshi. Together with his third wife Eve Marko, he empowered lay zen preceptors, and Eve Marko worked on a new set of \\"householder koans\\". Lay and circle forms of liturgy such as the Gate of Sweet Nectar, Glassman's translation, and elaboration of the traditional Japanese Kanromon ceremony of feeding the hungry ghosts, came to be explored and shared with the community. At the heart of the Zen Peacemakers approach is the conviction that service and social action are themselves zen practice, together with the challenge to develop new 'upayas' (tools) to meet each new situation. Formulations of spiritual principles specific to the order include \\"The Sixteen Practices of a Zen Peacemaker\\", comprising the \\"Three Refuges\\", the \\"Three Tenets\\" and the \\"Ten Practices\\" of a Zen Peacemaker  Zen Peacemaker Circles  In the early 2000s, Bernie Glassman and his third wife Eve Marko worked with circles of spiritually minded activists around the world to develop a consensus-based model for social action and interfaith spiritual practice. Initially called Peacemaker Circle International, they later became known as Zen Peacemaker Circles http://www.peacemakercircles.org. The interfaith strand of the Zen Peacemakers was influenced by Bernie Glassman's friendship with Sufi teacher and radio host Lex Hixon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AljMemDWzEc&t;=2s his appreciation of the Jewish renewal leader Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, and his many Christian zen students and successors. Zen Peacemaker Circles were established globally, presenting a model of zen practice that replaced the traditional role of 'Zen teacher' with innovative communities of practitioners learning from each other and sharing ideas between Circles. Decision making used the approach of Sociocracy, and Bernie Glassman created two new community roles of Steward and Circle Dharmaholder to support the model. The 'circular transmission' experiment was largely abandoned after the loss of the Mother House in 2011, although Zen Peacemaker Circle training continues in the UK,http://ukzenpeacemakers.blogspot.com Germany and the US. In other communities, the tools of Circle practice, especially Council circle have been incorporated into traditional zen training, to give a voice to students,http://imagine.sfzc.org/council/ for social actionhttps://upaya.org/uploads/pdfs/thesisfinaldraft.pdf and for governancehttp://www.zlmc.org/governance/  Street Retreats  'Street retreats', excursions by Bernie Glassman and others into the streets for days at a time to live amongst the homeless, have become a feature of Zen Peacemaker practice. Author James Ishmael Ford writes, \\"...'street retreats,' for instance, moves sesshin into the streets: participants eat in soup kitchens, and, if they know they're not displacing homeless people, sleep in homeless shelters or, otherwise, sleep in public places. Zazen takes place in parks and dokusan in alleys.\\" Socially Engaged Buddhism As a leader of Socially Engaged Buddhism, the Zen Peacemakers publish Bearing Witness, a free monthly online newsletter. The socially engaged practices of Zen Peacemakers is aimed at extending Dharma beyond the meditation hall to the worlds of business, social services, conflict resolution and environmental stewardship. Socially Engaged Buddhism has frequently led to new models of practice, allowing Buddhists to addressing the needs of individuals and communities in disadvantaged areas. The Zen Peacemakers' way is intended to \\"illuminate all life as a boundless meditation hall\\". Appraisal Religious historian Richard Hughes Seager writes \\"The Zen Peacemaker Order ... has the potential to rival Thich Nhat Hanh's groups and the Buddhist Peace Fellowship as a force in American activism\\".

Among his works is a fictitious dialogue between himself and an adherent of Catharism. \\"News of the Heretic\\" Sometime before 1292 Isarn wrote a 700-verse poetic dialogue in Occitan between himself and a fictitious Cathar bishop named Sicart de Figueiras. Novas del eretge (\\"News of the Heretic\\"), or The Controversy of Izarn, with an Albigense Theologian, as it is known, is a long diatribe against Catharism and its alleged doctrines. Isarn is sometimes inaccurate, but his ignorance, and that of many Catholics, as to the particulars of Cathar dogma, is probably the result of the meetings in thickets and bushes which he describes. The Cathars, in order to preach in the vernacular from vernacular Scriptures, often held secret meetings in the woods to escape notice. Isarn seems to believe that Cathars and Waldensians both believe some form of Manichaeism. He defends marriage against virginity as the supreme chastity. He is convinced moreover that the Ja no fara crezens heretje ni baudes / Si agues bon pastor que lur contradisses (\\"Yet they would not believe heretics (Cathars) or Waldensians / If they had a good pastor to contradict them [the heretics]\\"). At the end of the dialogue, the Cathar bishop is converted. Isarn initially portrays the converted heretic as desirous to keep his conversion a secret so that he may easily teach his followers the true faith. Isarn does not let this play out; he soon portrays the bishop as a copy of his own rabid Catholicism. References *Jeanroy, Alfred. La po√©sie lyrique des troubadours.

On this account alone, their entrance into the room was obstructed by some of the male members of the congregation, including Sydney Hodgson, until the conclusion of the Mass; these gentlemen then surrendered themselves. Hodgson and the others were brought to trial on 4 December 1591, the charge against him being merely that of receiving and relieving priests, and of being reconciled to the Church of Rome.

Amos Power Plant is a three-unit coal-fired power plant owned and operated by Appalachian Power, a subsidiary of American Electric Power (AEP). With a nameplate rating of 2,933 MW, it is the largest generating plant in the AEP system. It was named after John E. Amos, a prominent state senator, Democratic National Committee member from West Virginia, and member of the AEP board of directors. Background The plant is located between West Virginia Route 817 (Winfield Road) and the Kanawha River. Coal is delivered to the facility by barge or rail, after which it is stored in the plant's coal yard. The coal yard storage capacity can reach up to 1.75 million tons of coal, while the entire plant consumes an average of 26,000 tons of coal daily at full capacity.American Electric Power (2018) John E. Amos Plant [Pamphlet] The coal is then transported via conveyor belt from the coal yard into the plant, where it is pulverized into a fine, talcum powder-like consistency. Primary fans then blow the ground up coal into boilers where it burns at to turn water into steam. That steam gets sent into turbines, where it turns blades. These blades act like a windmill and drive a generator that produces electricity at 26,000 volts. Transformers outside the plant step up the voltage to 345,000 volts and 765,000 volts. Units 1 and 2 are of 816.3 MW nameplate capacity each, and were started up in September 1971, and June 1972 respectively. The boilers off of Units 1 and 2 deliver 5.3 million pounds of steam per hour using 12,500 gallons of water per minute. Containing 6 pulverizers per unit, 120,000 pounds of coal is ground up every hour. Unit 3, rated at 1,300 MW, was started up in October 1973. Unit 3's boiler system delivers 9.775 million pounds of steam per hour. All units are supercritical, dry-bottom boilers powered by a blend of low-sulfur coal and Northern Appalachian Basin high- sulfur coal. Phil Moye, a spokesman for AEP, said the energy generated at the John Amos Plant is enough to power about 2 million homes. The plant employs around 300 people with a payroll of $27.1 million dollars. A retirement analysis is to be conducted at Amos with a report due in 2022. The analysis, which will gauge the plant's economic viability and market conditions, is a part of an agreement between Appalachian Power and the Sierra Club. Environmental mitigation Appalachian Power installed selective catalytic reduction (SCR) on its three units beginning with Unit 3 in 2002, Unit 2 in 2004, and Unit 1 in 2005. The installation of SCRs reduced nitrogen oxide () emissions by 90%. The cost of installing all three SCRs totaled $346 million. The construction of flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) equipment at Amos was a $1.3 billion project completed in 2010. The FGD equipment reduced the plant's sulfur dioxide () emissions by 95%.

Kungsholmen in central Stockholm, Sweden. Bordering Riddarfj√§rden, the easternmost bay of Lake M√§laren, Norr M√§larstrand is a southbound boulevard stretching 1,4 km (4.500 ft) west from the Stockholm City Hall to the southern end of the street Sankt Eriksgatan. The most notable structures along the street are the series of functionalist residential buildings lined-up along its western part. The park facing the waterfront south of the street is popular for walks. Panoramic view of Norr M√§larstrand with the functionalist residential buildings on the extreme left and the Stockholm City Hall on the right.  History  The exterior of 66, Norr M√§larstrand, the residence of explorer Sven Hedin 1935-52, is a characteristic example of the functionalist buildings. The entrance of the building, a colourful celebration to the explorer, is not, however. A first proposal for a boulevard on the location in 1863-64, intended to embellish the area with a westbound entrance to the city similar to Strandv√§gen, the simultaneously proposed eastbound boulevard which, in contrast to the former, was actually built and became the grandiose front of the eastern district √ñstermalm. For Norr M√§larstrand, however, it would take another half-century before construction work on the Stockholm City Hall (1911-23) resulted in the urbanization of the area.Andersson, Stockholms √•rsringar, pp 129-130 A garrison of engineers stationed along the shore prevented an extension of the street until they were relocated elsewhere in the early 1920s. By that time, new garden cities in the suburbs had resulted in an increasing need for new western approach into the city. In 1928 the city bought the land from the Crown and a plan for the area designed by Albert Lilienberg the same year was accepted in 1930. Stepped gables then present were removed and replaced by the evenly spaced functionalist silhouettes -- the nine floors of which resulted in comparisons with cities in America and the epithet \\"Manhattan of Stockholm\\". The traditional dark, enclosed city blocks were opened up south and made into public parks, inviting light, air, and people in. A park designed by Erik Glemme was realised south of the street which transformed the street into a modern \\"riverside drive\\". The park forms the first section of a series of parks stretching west across Kungsholmen -- a style of urban parks known as the \\"Stockholm Style\\" (Stockholmsstilen) which was internationally acknowledge at the time.City of Stockholm, Stockholms parkhistoria, \\"Stockholmsstilen\\" section The buildings, most of them completed within two years, were adorned with characteristic Functionalist details, such as windows on corners, accentuated balconies, and flat roofs. Many of the buildings are, however, also adorned with classical details, including a building designed by architect Ragnar √ñstberg, an ambivalence which reflects the transition from the National Romantic Swedish architecture of the 1920s to the Functionalism introduced with the Stockholm Exhibition 1930. Bj√∂rn Hedvall, an architect who had realised the first Functionalist building on the street before 1930, is responsible for three of the southbound properties and more than a dozen of the other buildings in the blocks. On the John Ericssonsgatan street, architect Sven Markelius designed a radically new residential concept for collective accommodation. Influenced by the ideas of Alva and Gunnar Myrdal, the building, constructed 1934-35, featured small flats with many shared utilities throughout the building, including a food elevator bringing telephone-ordered dinners up from the restaurant on the ground floor; a chute for laundry; cleaning staff; and kindergartens. While this was one of the first such projects realised in Europe, a new concept which appealed to the radical intellectuals who settled there, the 50 apartments were served by 22 employees -- a luxury few could afford.

He served as Vice-Chancellor of Austria () from 1933 to 1934, leading the country into the period of Austrofascism under Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss. Fey played a vital role in the violent suppression of the Republikanischer Schutzbund and the Social Democratic Workers' Party during the 1934 Austrian Civil War.  Life  A career officer since 1908, Fey in the rank of a Major fought with the Common Army in World War I and was awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresa in 1916. After the war, he joined the Carinthian paramilitary Heimwehr forces against the Yugoslavian troops. In 1927 he founded a local Heimwehr branch in Vienna and became a member of the conservative Christian Social Party. As his political career proceeded, he increasingly rivalled with Heimwehr leader Ernst R√ºdiger Starhemberg; both commanders backed the rise of Chancellor Dollfuss and his successor Kurt Schuschnigg, only to be largely disempowered after the implementation of the authoritarian Federal State of Austria (St√§ndestaat). On 17 October 1932 Fey joined Dollfuss' cabinet in the rank of a state secretary concerned with public security. He immediately had all conventions of the Social Democrats, the Communists and the Austrian Nazis banned. After the chancellor had suspended the sessions of the National Council, Fey on 15 March 1933 concentrated Heimwehr forces to occupy the Austrian Parliament Building, however, any operation was aborted by the Vienna police. During a parade in May 1933, Major Fey reportedly \\"knocked three Nazis unconscious with his own ochsenkn√ºttel (square-edged bludgeon)\\" and promoted Austrian nationalism. Chancellor Dollfuss made him his deputy on 21 September 1933. Fey continued the persecution of Republikanischer Schutzbund members; the arrest of several Social Democratic politicians on 12 February 1934 sparked the Austrian Civil War. Dollfuss mistrusted Fey's capabilities and on 1 May he lost his office of Vice-Chancellor to his bitter rival Starhemberg. During the July Putsch and Dollfuss' assassination he stayed in the background, later accusations of collaboration with the Nazis have never been conclusively established. He once again joined the Schuschnigg cabinet as Minister for Interior until his final disempowerment in 1935, shunt off to the Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft. Upon the Anschluss annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, Fey was interrogated by Gestapo agents on 15 March 1938. Harassed, he returned home, summoned his 46-year-old wife Malvine and his son Herbert, and wrote an appeal for help to the former Vice-Chancellor Edmund Glaise-Horstenau. Without awaiting the answer, he shot his family and himself in the early morning of the following day.

Simon Foner at MIT Lincoln Laboratory invented VSM in 1955 and reported it in 1959. Also it was mentioned by G.W. Van Oosterhout and by P.J Flanders in 1956. A sample is first magnetized in a uniform magnetic field. It is then sinusoidally vibrated, typically through the use of a piezoelectric material. Commercial systems use linear actuators of some form. Historically, these systems were developed using modified audio speakers, though this approach was dropped due to the interference through the produced in-phase magnetic noise, as the magnetic flux through a nearby pickup coil varies sinusoidally. The induced voltage in the pickup coil is proportional to the sample's magnetic moment, but does not depend on the strength of the applied magnetic field. In a typical setup, the induced voltage is measured with a lock-in amplifier using the piezoelectric signal as a frequency reference. It is also possible to record the hysteresis curve of a material by sweeping the magnetic field. The idea of vibrating sample came from D. O. Smith's vibrating-coil magnetometer.

Southern California Edison is the majority owner of the plant and was its operator. The plant entered commercial operation in 1971. A steam line that ran near the plant's control room and cafeteria ruptured on June 9, 1985, fatally scalding six and injuring ten more. In 2005, the plant was shut down and was later dismantled. Design The plant was composed of two units capable of generating 790 MWe each. During normal operation, output varied between 350 and 750 MWe; the baseload plant operated with a capacity factor of 71.5% between 1990 and 1998. Combustion Engineering supplied the boilers and GE supplied the turbine-generators. Bechtel was the architect- engineer, responsible for engineering, procurement and construction. The Mohave Generating Station was built on a site in the Mojave Desert adjacent to the Colorado River in Laughlin, Clark County, Nevada. It had supercritical boilers and cross-compound steam turbines. The plant was owned by a utility consortium of operator Southern California Edison Co (56%), LADWP (10%), Nevada Power (14%), and Salt River Project (20%). Mohave was the only power plant in the United States that used coal delivered by coal-slurry pipeline, composed of approximately half coal and half water. The 18 inch (460 mm) diameter Black Mesa Pipeline ran to the plant from the Peabody Energy Black Mesa Mine in Kayenta, AZ, and could deliver per hour. The coal slurry was stored in four storage tanks or eight Marcona ponds. Each storage tank held up to , the equivalent of of dry coal; the conical Marcona ponds were each in diameter and deep, for a capacity of or of coal. Eight full ponds was the equivalent of a 40-day supply of coal for the plant. The slurry transport water was separated from the coal through a series of centrifuges, which removed approximately 75% of the water, the damp coal then passed through pulverizers for drying and grinding. The plant had a total of 20 pulverizers, each of which could process of coal per hour. The separated water was stored in clariflocculators to allow remaining coal fines to settle; the water was then recycled for cooling tower water makeup; this and all other waste water was reused, making Mohave a zero-discharge facility. Bullhead City, Arizona with the prominent tall stack at Mohave in the background. Photo by Charles O'Rear for Documerica (1972). At full capacity, the plant consumed of coal per day. Ash was collected from the bottom of the steam generating units (bottom and economizer ash) and captured via electrostatic precipitation from the plant's stack (fly ash); 70% of the plant's total ash was fly ash, and almost all of the fly ash was sold to be used as a concrete additive. Approximately of bottom ash and of sludge were placed in an onsite landfill each year; the disposal site, named Ash Canyon, was approximately in area. A in diameter natural-gas pipeline also ran to the plant from a gas facility near Topock, Arizona to supply the required heat to start the plant, although the pipeline was too small to operate the plant exclusively on natural gas. Electricity was transmitted via two 500kV lines to substations in southern Nevada and southern California. HistoryCommissioning= The plant's two identical units went into initial operation in 1971. =Early failures= The plant's turbine- generators suffered two early failures before 1975. Both of these failures resulted in failures of the turbine-generators, and both failures occurred during unseasonably cold weather. The cold weather proved to be the essential clue. One of the joint owners (LADWP) was assigned to determine the cause of these failures, through use of computer simulations. The power station and its connected 500 kV transmission systems (one to California, the other to Nevada) were subjected to extensive simulations, which ultimately led to identification of the root cause of the failures. When initially installed, the then-new concept of \\"series compensation\\" (sets of capacitors connected in series at the sending- and receiving-ends of the transmission lines) were installed, with the expectation that this \\"series compensation\\" would reduce or even eliminate the losses inherent with long distance power transmission lines. What was not then known, but was later identified during the simulations, which were performed in the System Development Division of LADWP, was the series resistance of the ACSR transmission lines, when under near freezing conditions, combined with the \\"series compensation\\", which was designed to counteract the series impedance of the lines, could, under certain conditions of generation and load, and low ambient temperatures, place an effective negative impedance on the generators, thereby causing a mechanical response by the turbine-generators that resulted in their destruction. This behavior had not been anticipated, and as it had not been anticipated, it could hardly have been simulated prior to the installation and commissioning of the power station. In general, such simulations focused on steady-state system behavior, not subsystem transient behavior. These two failures caused a renewed interest in \\"dynamic\\" simulation. Only \\"static\\" (that is, steady- state) simulation had been done previously. General Electric, the manufacturer of the turbine-generators, refused to repair or replace subsequent damage‚Äîafter all it had already replaced two failed turbine-generators due to reasons which were then unknown, and were subsequently proved not to be its fault‚Äîso new operational procedures were implemented to prevent subsequent failures. These procedures were successful, and there were no more turbine- generator failures. But, these new procedures would not address what later happened, due to other causes, including improper operation of the steam generator's \\"reheat\\" system, which is a usual, and necessary part of a \\"compound\\" turbine-generator system (a high-pressure 3600 rpm turbine section compounded with a lower-pressure 1800 rpm turbine section, both of which were supplied by the same steam generator, but using separate reheat \\"loops\\"). Typical thermal power plant with two-stage turbine; the reheat line starts at the HP turbine exhaust (E) and proceeds through the boiler before returning to the LP turbine (F). =1985 pipe failure disaster= At 3:25 pm on June 9, 1985, a hot reheat line, carrying steam at , burst open. The reheat line circulates exhaust steam from the high pressure turbine back through the boiler stack, where it is reheated before entering the low pressure turbine. A steam cloud blew down a door leading to the control room of the station, fatally scalding six workers: Michael Bowman, John Dolan, Ernest Hernandez, Terry Leroy, Danny Norman, and Howard Turner. Ten others were injured. A preliminary report cited a faulty weld as the immediate cause. Approximately 35 employees were on-site at the time; of those, 20 were in the control room. The station was out of service for six months while all the steam piping was replaced. A report on the accident was completed in May 1991, but was not released until Christmas Day because of Edison's objections that it would compromise civil suits. Although several factors contributed to the pipe's failure, the report said Edison's actions‚Äîor lack of actions‚Äîwere \\"primary and critical factors in causing the accident\\": * Edison knowingly operated the system at temperatures above design specification for long periods of time, and operators were unable to control the temperatures within the system as a result of a \\"design flaw.\\" * Even so, the pipe, part of a steam reheat system, was not routinely maintained or inspected, though the pipe shifted and distorted because of exposure to abnormal stresses, the report said. * Edison's management made high production a priority over safety. In 1979, Edison disciplined a supervisor for ordering an unauthorized inspection of unrelated pipe welds. \\"The fear SCE management has instilled in its employees is counterproductive to safety and increases the chances that additional incidents as serious as this one may occur in the future,\\" the report said. The report found no evidence that the accident was caused by a specific action on the day of the pipe failure. The report recommended sweeping changes to Edison's policies, including annual reports to the PUC on the utility's safety training, inspection and maintenance programs. In addition, the report argues that, because the accident was avoidable, the costs should be borne by Edison's shareholders, not its rate-paying customers. =Shutdown= The plant was shut down on December 31, 2005, with the possibility it may not reopen. With the shutdown of the plant, the mine supplying the coal was also closed as well. The land where the mine was located is owned by the Navajo and Hopi tribes. This closure had a major negative impact on the Hopi. The plant was shut to comply with a consent agreement reached to settle a 1998 CAA lawsuit brought by several environmental groups. The plant had been targeted as a major source of pollution in the Grand Canyon and other locations to the east. Furthermore, the Hopi and Navajo signed an agreement preventing the use of water from the local aquifer to make up slurry. Various plans were presented, including selling the plant and retrofitting it to burn natural gas, although the latter would have required construction of a second high pressure gas line from Topock, to the south. Another option would have been to install exhaust scrubbers, which would have cost $1 billion. In May 2007, SCE discontinued efforts to restart or sell the plant. =Dismantling= On June 10, 2009, Southern California Edison announced that the Mohave Generating Station would be decommissioned and all generating equipment would be removed from the site. Later, SCE announced that all administrative buildings on site would also be razed. The only structure remaining on the property will be the 500 kV switchyard, which will continue to serve as a switching location for the regional bulk power system as well as provide electricity to a nearby Nevada Power substation supplying the Laughlin area. Dismantling got underway in October 2009 and is expected to take 2 years and cost $30 million. About 300 staff lost their jobs when the plant was closed. On March 11, 2011, the exhaust stack, a longtime landmark of the Laughlin/Bullhead City area, was felled by explosives. In October 2016, the entire site was listed for sale.

Life In 1579 Dymoke received the Catholic priest, Richard Kirkman, at his manor of Scrivelsby, and maintained him as schoolmaster to his sons. He was himself, at the time, an occasional conformist to the Anglican state religion. He was reconciled to the Catholic Church in 1580, either by Kirkman or by Edmund Campion.

The University launched officially its regular teaching activities in 1994.  History  The creation of The National University of General San Martin was enabled by two trends: the first, following a tendency initiated in the 1970s, decentralization of the largest universities in Argentina; and the second, following the desire of the local community of San Martin to establish a university in its own territory. This TENSION forged the initial identity of the institution, promoting the capacities and meeting the local demands, and responding to the vacant areas in the Argentinian university system. The first academic activities of undergraduate and postgraduate students began in 1994. The university has as its aim and standard the following concepts and ideals: academic liberty and respect for the diversity of thought; team spirit for the continual improvement of the institution; social responsibility and service vocation; efficiency and transparency in management; and respect for other's work and respect for the work environment.  Campus  \\"'Campus Miguelete'\\" is the grounds of UNSAM and occupies a space of 8.5 hectares, with 48,000 square meters of the surface constructed in the year 2013 and a total plan that reaches 220,000 square meters.

As a schoolboy, Collins played rugby and trained in athletics. He began training in Kyokushin karate at the age of 15, at the Cardiff School of Budo. It was around this time that he first read about Masutatsu Oyama and decided that he would eventually travel to Japan to train. In 1967, Collins decided to join the London Metropolitan Police‚Äîbut only three weeks after he had set off on this endeavour, his mother died. He worked in London for two years before joining the merchant navy, with the aim of working his way to Japan. Collins was 21 when he eventually left for Japan.

It is the largest public university in Argentine Patagonia. Its university statute (Ordinance # 470/2009) stipulates free admission to all of its programs and ensures freedom of speech for the development of its activities.  History  Its history can be traced to the University of Neuqu√©n, the provincial university created in 1965 to prevent the migration of students and promote the establishment of teachers, established on land donated by the Municipality of Neuqu√©n, an area of 107 hectares, over the annexation of other further land, which in total amounted to 120 hectares that were built in parks and gardens around the premises. Founded by Doctor Guillermo Rodolfo Pessagno (Neuquen). At first, its teaching curriculum was in the field of Educational Sciences and taught Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, History, Geography, and Literature Castilian and Natural Sciences as well as covering the fields of Social Anthropology, Psychology, Management, Tourism, Geology and Mining. In 1971, National University of Comahue was created by national law, under the Taquini Plan. It was created from the University of Neuqu√©n and other colleges scattered throughout the region. On March 15, 1972 the first school year in the new campus began, on the basis of the educational experience of the provincial university and the institutes that preceded it, which had formed several classes of graduates. The University is based in two areas linked by a social and cultural history in common the name must Comahue. His coat is based on the Mapuche worldview and human figures found in crafts and paintings. Silvia Blumenfeld was professor of mycology here from 1986 until 2004. The announcement of the creation of the National University of R√≠o Negro in 2005 generated great uncertainty in the UNC. Initially the project included the extinction of the university, then it was modified to start talking about \\"complementarity\\" between the two houses of higher learning. This change helped to achieve the majority support Argentine National Congress. The Pehuensat-1 satellite was created for educational purposes, built entirely in Argentina. Its launch took place on January 10, 2007 morning aboard a rocket from an aerospace base in India. The assembly took five years and was conducted by teachers and students of the university. They called Pehuensat-1 in reference to the monkey-puzzle tree, an ancient tree and native to the Andean Patagonian forest. The Argentine satellite weighs 6 pounds, goes into orbit about 640 miles high and traveling at a speed around the Earth of 25 000 kilometers per hour. It has an aluminum body structure and space-like solar panels on one side. The electronics consists of a transmitter, a computer and two packs of batteries that are recharged with solar energy. Also responsible for transmitting antenna to Earth parameters.

It is marketed in Japan as „Çµ„É≥„É™„Ç∫„É† (Sunrythm). It was developed by Suntory Holdings Limited and first released in 1991. The JAN applies to the hydrochloride salt, pilsicainide hydrochloride.  Medical uses  Pilsicainide is a drug used clinically in Japan to treat cardiac arrhythmias. A cardiac arrhythmia includes any abnormal heartbeat and can be manifested as tachycardia, bradycardia, or other irregular rhythms. Pilsicainide has been proven successful in treating both ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias with few adverse effects. It is especially effective in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia. It may result from various heart abnormalities or may occur spontaneously in a seemingly healthy individual. Atrial fibrillation is characterized by rapid, disorganized electrical impulses in the atria resulting in depolarization of only a small group of myocardial cells. This prevents the atria from undergoing coordinated contraction, instead resulting in small fibrillations of the heart muscle. Re- entry occurs when an impulse does not die after activating the heart but instead returns to the atria and causes re-excitation. Simultaneous re-entry of multiple impulses with short wavelengths results in atrial fibrillation. Impulse wavelength is the product of the conduction velocity and the effective refractory period. Pilsicainide suppresses atrial conduction velocity but also increases the effective refractory period. Its effects on the refractory period are significantly more substantial, and therefore pilsicainide treatment results in an increased wavelength and termination of atrial fibrillation. A single oral dose of pilsicainide effectively restores normal sinus rhythm in patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation and a healthy left ventricle. Long-term therapy with pilsicainide is successful in treating chronic atrial fibrillation).  Pharmacology  It functions by blocking the fast inward movement of sodium ions through the Nav1.5 sodium channel that contributes to the rapid depolarization characteristic of phase 0 in the cardiac action potential. Pilsicainide is a pure sodium channel blocker, meaning it does not significantly affect any other cardiac channels including potassium and calcium channels. Pilsicainide binds to a common site on the sodium channel through either intracellular or extracellular application. The affinity of pilsicainide for the sodium channel receptor and its rate of binding are dependent on the state of the channel. It has been proven to have a greater affinity for the receptor in its inactivated state as opposed to resting or open, thereby following the modulated receptor hypothesis. Binding of pilsicainide selectively inhibits the channel, preventing the movement of sodium ions into the cardiac cell. This decreases the rate of depolarization of the cell membrane as well as the action potential amplitude, but has no effect on the overall duration of the action potential. Suppression of the depolarization rate is use-dependent, and therefore inhibition increases with increased stimulation. Pilsicainide also causes delayed impulse conduction through the myocardium in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of pilsicainide have a slow rate of onset and offset resulting in a prolonged recovery time. This contributes to its potent blocking activity and its classification as a class 1c antiarrhythmic agent.

He was a Roman Catholic landowner in Staffordshire, and came forward as a witness in the defence of the accused Catholic aristocrat, William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford, which led to his own death in prison, although he had never been brought to trial.  Life  Gerard was friendly with Jesuit missioners in England, and had three sons at their college of St-Omer. He was trustee for them for some small properties. He attended a gathering on the feast of the Assumption, 1678, when Father John Gavan made his profession as a member of the Society of Jesus, at the house of the Penderels at Boscobel. This was the family who had sheltered Charles II after the battle of Worcester; and after dinner the party visited the Royal Oak, the tree in which Charles had hidden. This circumstance came to the knowledge of the notorious Plot informer Stephen Dugdale, and became the occasion of Richard's imprisonment and death. Dugdale accused him of having contributed to the funds of the alleged plotters (perhaps with some reference to the pensions paid for his boys at St-Omer) and of having conspired to murder the King. Dugdale's principal target was not Gerard himself but Lord Stafford, who was executed for treason in December 1680, largely on Dugdale's evidence. Gerard would have been a crucial alibi witness and his death seriously undermined Stafford's defence (which Stafford, like all those accused of treason in that era, was obliged to conduct himself, without benefit of legal counsel). Examined by the Lords' committee (19 May 1679) he confessed to the meeting at Boscobel, and was thrown into Newgate Jail. There he was kept ten months without trial, before falling ill of gaol fever and dying.John Kenyon, The Popish Plot (1972), pp. 51 and 164. He was attended during his last hours by Father Edward Petre, who, in a letter written 29 March 1680, speaks of his dying wish to be buried by the side of his friend, Thomas Whitbread, then recently executed.  Family  He was the son of John Gerard of Hilderstne, Staffordshire and grandson of Sir Gilbert Gerard. The Gerards Bromley branch of the Gerard family, which divided off from the original stock of Bryn, Lancashire in the fourteenth century, grew to power and affluence through his grandfather Sir Gilbert Gerard, who was Attorney General to Elizabeth I of England 1559-1581. He is said to have obtained the estate of Gerard's Bromley, through a court intrigue, from the Catholic Sir Thomas Gerard of Bryn (father of the Jesuit John Gerard), as the price for which the knight bought off the prosecution against him for adhering to Mary, Queen of Scots. In 1603 Gilbert's son Thomas Gerard, uncle of Richard, was made Baron Gerard of Gerard's Bromley, County Stafford. Richard's his third son, Philip Gerard (born 1 December 1665), having entered the Society of Jesus 7 September 1684, unexpectedly became seventh and last Baron Gerard of Gerard's Bromley (12 April 1707, O.S.), following the deaths of various cousins and older brothers. Philip never claimed the title, and gave up all rights to the estates for a small yearly pension of ¬£60, being obliged to leave the country by the action of a near connection, the Duke of Hamilton, who advertised the reward of ¬£1,000 for his arrest as a priest. (The four lords who have been among the English Jesuits all lived at the same time. Philip Gerard (d. 1733) was the contemporary of Father Gilbert Talbot (d. 1743), who became Earl of Shrewsbury in 1717; also of Father William Molyneux (d. 1754), who was Viscount Sefton in 1745; also of Father Charles Dormer (d. 1761), who was Baron Dormer in 1728.)

Eberhard Nestle (May 1, 1851, Stuttgart ‚Äì March 9, 1913, Stuttgart) was a German biblical scholar, textual critic, orientalist, editor of the Novum Testamentum Graece, and the father of Erwin Nestle.  Life  Nestle was a son of the upper tribunal procurator (Obertribunalprokurator) Christian Gottlieb Nestle and his wife Sophie Beate Kleinmann. His half- brother from his father's second marriage was classical philologist Wilhelm Nestle. Nestle studied at the University of T√ºbingen ‚Äì the T√ºbinger Stift ‚Äì from 1869 to 1874. His studies culminated in his doctoral thesis on the Hebrew and Greek text forms of the Book of Ezekiel. Afterwards he worked in the area of orientalism and wrote, among other things, a Syriac grammar. During his later years, his focus changed to textual criticism of the New Testament. Between 1898 and 1912 he worked as professor at the Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren. In 1880, he married Klara Kommerell (1852‚Äì87) in T√ºbingen; they had one son, Erwin Nestle. In 1887 his wife died after a short illness, and three years later, in 1890, Nestle married Elisabeth Aichele (1867‚Äì1944). In this second marriage, five daughters and one son were born. In 1898 Nestle published a handbook of textual criticism, and in 1898 published the first edition of a Greek New Testament under the title Novum Testamentum Graece cum apparatu critico ex editionibus et libris manu scriptis collecto. The text of this Greek New Testament was combined with the editions of Constantin von Tischendorf (Editio octava critica maior), The New Testament in the Original Greek of Westcott and Hort, and the edition of Richard Francis Weymouth. It was edited by the W√ºrttemberg Bible Society in Stuttgart. This edition eliminated the extremes of Tischendorf, such as partiality to Sinaiticus, and of Westcott and Hort, such as partiality to Vaticanus. This edition was adopted by the British and Foreign Bible Society, replacing the Textus Receptus. After a few years this edition received worldwide recognition as the best edition of the Greek New Testament. This edition took the place which formerly belonged to the Textus Receptus and became a \\"New Textus Receptus\\". After the death of Eberhard Nestle his son Erwin Nestle (1883‚Äì1972) took over the publication and contributed substantially to a constant improvement of the editions. Since 1952 the edition occurred with the cooperation of Kurt Aland (21st edition). The theological standard work \\"Nestle-Aland\\" appeared from 1993 in the 27th edition.

It is based in Oban, Tobermory (Isle of Mull) and Croabh on the west coast of Scotland. It is usually held in the first week of August each year. History The event began in 1882 when the committee of Royal Highland Yacht Club held a regatta in Oban in two classes - yachts under forty tons and yachts over forty tons. In 1947 the three local sailing clubs - Royal Highland Yacht Club, Oban Sailing Club and Western Isles Yacht Club - agreed to combine their separate regattas to provide one significant event, with each club contributing two days towards a six-day regatta. In due course the management of the event was handed over to a Joint Regatta Committee comprising five representatives from each club, with additional co-opted members, and this is how it is managed today although Western Isles Yacht Club are no longer part of the Joint Regatta Committee. West Highland Yachting Week has since become one of the leading international yachting events, with a combination of round the buoys and passage racing, supported by an extensive social programme. The Racing This year there are three feeder races which help to gather the whole fleet together at Craobh Marina. The seventieth anniversary regatta sees the reinstatement of the feeder race from the Clyde, now running from Largs to Ardrishaig on Friday 28 July, and the races from Gigha and Oban to Craobh on Saturday 29 July. Entertainment is provided onshore at Craobh on the two evenings the fleet is based there. On Sunday yachts race in the area off Craobh, around Shuna and Loch Melfort. On Monday the race is from Craobh up to Oban, which is the base until Wednesday morning. While in Oban, some yachts take up moorings or anchor off the Esplanade, off Oban Sailing Club, or at one of the local marinas, but for 2017, the new Oban Transit Marina at the North Pier should be open to welcome the fleet. Tuesday sees the return of the Round Lismore Race, which can only be run on certain years when tides are suitable due to the strong tidal influences around the island of Lismore. This race gives the challenge of narrow channels, many natural hazards, and close views of beautiful shorelines. On Wednesday the fleet races up the Sound of Mull to Tobermory. Thursday sees the fleet racing off Tobermory an around the northern end of the Sound of Mull, Friday sees the final race back down the Sound of Mull to Oban for the final night's celebrations, which will this year take place at Dunstaffnage Marina. The event sees yachts passing over 100 miles of coastline, but no doubt actually covering many times that distance whilst racing. Dates West Highland Yachting Week will be held from 28 July to 4 August 2017 when it celebrates its 70th anniversary.

It is marketed in tablet form under the brand name Edarbi as the prodrug azilsartan medoxomil. The most common adverse reaction in adults is diarrhea. It is also sold as a combination drug with chlortalidone under the brand name Edarbyclor. Medical uses Azilsartan is used for the treatment of hypertension in adults. Contraindications Azilsartan must not be used with aliskiren, a renin inhibitor, in patients with diabetes as this increases the risk of serious adverse effects. Like other antihypertensive drugs acting on the renin‚Äìangiotensin system, it is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. It should not be used during pregnancy in the United States. Interactions No relevant drug interactions have been found in studies. Based on experiences with other drugs acting on the renin‚Äìangiotensin system, it is theorized that azilsartan could increase the toxicity of lithium and of other drugs increasing potassium levels, such as potassium sparing diuretics. PharmacologyMechanism of action= Azilsartan medoxomil lowers blood pressure by blocking the action of angiotensin II at the AT1 receptor, a hormone that contracts blood vessels and reduces water excretion through the kidneys. =Pharmacokinetics= Azilsartan medoxomil is quickly absorbed from the gut, independently of food intake. Maximal blood plasma concentrations are reached after one to three hours. The liver enzyme CYP2C9 is involved in the formation of the two main metabolites, which are pharmacologically inactive; they are the O-deethylation and decarboxylation products of azilsartan. Elimination half life is about 11 hours. 55% are excreted via the feces, and 42% via the urine, of which 15% are present as azilsartan and the rest in form of the metabolites. Chemistry Azilsartan medoxomil, the prodrug The drug formulation contains the potassium salt of azilsartan medoxomil (codenamed TAK-491), an ester of azilsartan's carboxyl group with the alcohol (5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxol-4-yl)methanol. This ester is more lipophilic than azilsartan itself. History In February 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved azilsartan medoxomil for the treatment of high blood pressure in adults. In July 2011, azilsartan medoxomil was approved in the European Union for the treatment of essential hypertension. In March 2012, Health Canada approved the drug for mild to moderate essential hypertension.Notice of Decision for Edarbi In December 2014, Valeant Canada acquired the marketing rights to Edarbi and Edarbyclor from Takeda Pharmaceutical.

Gameplay The player driving the Lotus Esprit Turbo in Test Drive. The player chooses one of five supercars (Lamborghini Countach, Lotus Esprit Turbo, Chevrolet Corvette C4, Porsche 911 Turbo (930), or Ferrari Testarossa) to drive on a winding cliffside two-lane road while avoiding traffic and outrunning police speed traps. The course's five stages are separated by gas station pit stops.Test Drive manual Release In 1987, Accolade published Test Drive as a computer game worldwide, and Electronic Arts imported it to the United Kingdom. The quality of the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and DOS ports differ from each other.https://archive.org/stream/cvg- magazine-076/CVG_076_Feb_1988#page/n45/mode/1up/ The Amiga version's detailed visuals and audio realistically depicted the game's racing theme, while its Atari ST counterpart used simplified graphics and sound effects. The Commodore 64 and DOS ports were of similar quality to the Amiga version. The gameplay was kept intact for all platforms.https://archive.org/stream/thegamesmachine- magazine-04/TheGamesMachine_04#page/n57/mode/ Reception and legacy Test Drive was a commercial success, with sales having surpassed 250,000 copies by November 1989. It received generally positive reviews from video game critics. Computer Gaming World stated in 1987 that Test Drive \\"offers outstanding graphics and the potential to 'hook' every Pole Position fan\\". Compute! praised the excellent graphics and sound, but noted that the game only had one course. The game was reviewed in 1988 in Dragon #132 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. Test Drive spawned several sequels and spin-offs. Distinctive Software developed its 1989 sequel, The Duel: Test Drive II, using several software libraries. Distinctive (as Unlimited Software, Inc.) used the aforementioned software libraries for a MS-DOS port of Outrun, resulting in the Accolade v. Distinctive lawsuit. Distinctive Software won, so the rights to make the Test Drive games without the source code transferred to Accolade. The court also found that Accolade had failed to demonstrate that the balance of hardships was in its favor. Another sequel, Test Drive III: The Passion, was developed and published by Accolade in 1990. In 1997, Accolade distributed Test Drive: Off-Road, an off-road truck racing spinoff, and Test Drive 4, the first video game developed by Pitbull Syndicate.https://web.archive.org/web/20020207132058/http://www.pitbull.co.uk/games.html In 1998, Pitbull Syndicate developed two further Test Drive titles, Test Drive 4X4 (also known as Test Drive Off-Road 2), a sequel to the Test Drive: Off- Road spinoff, and Test Drive 5; both games were the two last entries in the series to be published by Accolade. In April 1999, Accolade was acquired by French video game company Infogrames Entertainment for a combined sum of , of which in cash and in growth capital, and was renamed Infogrames North America, Inc. The company chief executive officer, Jim Barnett, was named head of Infogrames Entertainment's American distribution subsidiary. As a result, Test Drive 6 was the first game in the series to be published by Infogrames in 1999. TD Overdrive: The Brotherhood of Speed (also known as Test Drive) was the last entry in the series to be developed by Pitbull Syndicate, and as a result, the next game in the series, Test Drive: Eve of Destruction, was developed by Monster Games in 2003.

The Dale Avenue building was converted to Central Grammar School in 1939. The current Gloucester High School, located along the Annisquam River, near the entrance to Gloucester Harbor, was completed in 1939, with an addition in the 1970s and a new Field House wing added in the 1990s.

Smith II, U.S. Senator from Massachusetts * Vermin Supreme, political satirist and perennial candidate for public office Teen pregnancy controversy On June 18, 2008, the high school drew international attention as news broke that 18 students had become pregnant in the last year, over four times the previous year's reported pregnancies. Principal Joseph Sullivan claimed that some of the girls had made a pact to become pregnant together, one even seeking a homeless 24-year-old man in her pursuits to conceive. But Gloucester mayor Carolyn Kirk quickly responded that they had no confirmation of any pregnancy pact. Finally, one pregnant student, interviewed on Good Morning America, said: > There was definitely no pact [...] There was a group of girls already > pregnant that decided they were going to help each other to finish school > and raise their kids together. Media reactions to the event ranged from general criticism of the episode as representing a misguided adolescent shortcut to adulthood and identity, to the matter of whether statutory rape occurred. (Some of the girls were under 16, which in Massachusetts made it illegal for their partners to have sex with them.) However, most early media reactions were not completely accurate because they had not received all of the necessary information until later. During the 2007‚Äì2008 school year, two staff members began to publicly advocate that the school clinic provide contraception without parental consent, largely in response to the surge in student pregnancies. This recommendation drew opposition from the board of Addison Gilbert Hospital, which sponsors the clinic. The clinic staff, a pediatrician and nurse practitioner, resigned in protest at the end of the school year. On October 8, 2008 the Gloucester School Committee granted the use of contraceptives through the Student Health Center, provided the students had parental approval. The \\"pregnancy pact\\" controversy inspired some fictional treatments. The Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode \\"Babes\\", airing in November 2008, featured a pregnancy pact between four high-school girls, with one becoming involved with a mentally-ill homeless man to conceive. The following March, an episode of Bones, \\"The Salt in the Wounds\\", featured a high-school girls' volleyball team with many members pregnant or already having given birth. Barbara Delinsky published a book titled, 'Not My Daughter', which was inspired by events in Gloucester. On January 23, 2010, Lifetime premiered a new movie called The Pregnancy Pact, which is inspired by these events. The controversy is also the subject of a documentary, \\"The Gloucester 18.\\" The film crew interviewed a number of the girls allegedly involved in the \\"pact\\", many of whom speak publicly for the first time in the movie. The documentary purports to be the only source of the true story behind the Gloucester pregnancy pact and includes interviews with the girls and their families as well as Dr. Brian Orr and nurse Kimberly Daly, who ran the health clinic at Gloucester High during the time of the controversy. It also went international with the 2010 Spanish miniseries titled, El Pacto based on the Gloucester High pact as well as a 2011 French feature film, 17 Girls, a story of \\"young female friendship‚Äîand naivet√©\\" is based on the Gloucester High \\"pact.\\" It is the first feature film from sisters Delphine and Muriel Coulin.

Naturally, having spent so much of his time in Italy at church, he first discovered his talents for art when he would attempt to replicate some of the church's statues using clay he found in nearby fields. There was also at lot of art in his area, which pushed Zofrea to try it for himself. He often draws on literary, historical and religious sources to develop intriguing tableaux and has three times been awarded Australia's most prestigious prize for a subject painting, the Sulman - in 1977, 1979 and 1982.The New McCulloch's Encyclopedia of Australian Art, 1054 In 1981 he received the Power Bequest Grant to study in Paris for six months. In 1985 he was awarded the Churchill Scholarship to study fresco painting in Italy, which he accepted, and spent a year or so back home, learning more tools of the trade.. He has been named one of the best painters in Australia. His commissions include the acclaimed Sydney Morning Herald mural Justelius, the Power Studio in the Cite University, five panel mural for the State Bank of NSW, Sydney Opera House Fresco sponsored by Toshiba P/L in 1992, commissioned by the Darling Harbour Star City Casino in 1997, and a five panel mural \\"Celebration of Life - A Picnic at Clontarf\\" commissioned by the NRMA in 1998. Today, he is celebrated for his sensuous, expressionistic colour, and a richness of input from his imagination and experience. He was a finalist in the Archibald Prize in 2014 and 2018.

Renewable energy, (RE) law also relates to the land use, siting, and finance issues encountered by developers of renewable energy projects. Renewable energy support laws Renewable energy law also encompasses policies that relate to renewable energy and legislative instruments that further encourage its growth. =Feed-in tariffs= One such form of legislation is feed-in tariffs, which provide economic incentives to the developers of renewable energy projects by setting a fixed price for the sale of energy produced from renewable sources. Feed-in tariff laws also provide financial certainty, are more cost effective and less bureaucratic than other support schemes such as investment or production tax credits, quota based renewable portfolio standards (RPS), and auction mechanisms.EC, 2005; Morris, 2007; Butler & Neuhoff, 2008 In addition, the feed-in tariff generates more competition, more jobs, and more rapid deployment for manufacturing; it also does not pick technological winners, for instance between more mature wind power technology versus solar photovoltaics technology. =Renewable Portfolio standards= This type of law is in force in 37 of the States within the United States, as well as Australia and a minority of European nations. It works by fixing the quantity of renewable electricity that must be produced, and leaving it to the market at what price this extra renewable electricity will be produced. This form of legislation typically employs a tradeable certificates mechanism, where 1 Megawatt Hour of electricity is equivalent to 1 renewable energy certificate. =Auctions and tenders= This form of renewable energy incentive is established by legislation and regulations and is increasingly popular throughout the world as a policy choice for governments. The details of the auction need to be carefully designed to prevent sub-optimal outcomes.  Sector Regulation  The Role of the Sector Regulator is specified in the enabling legislation. For example, regulatory oversight of feed-in tariff programs is essential, whether the price is based on a predetermined number (and with some maximum capacity), an auction/bidding process, or avoided cost. In each case, the regulator monitors activities to ensure abuses do not arise. How external (environmental and health) costs are factored into program evaluation is partly dependent on the enabling legislation (or executive order). If the law establishes Renewable Portfolio Standards, the energy regulator will need to oversee the system and evaluate its effectiveness in meeting RE objectives. Generally, some other agency is responsible for certifying the generators and handling the certification system. The sector regulator has a number of roles and responsibilities for operationalizing and implementing RE. The policy instruments include those oriented towards prices and quantities. The former (such as Feed-in Tariffs) provide the supplier with certainty regarding price, but the volume depends on whether that price is high or relatively low. The latter includes renewable portfolio standards that require distribution companies to purchase specific quantities of electricity generated by renewable technologies. In addition, the sector regulator is in a position to give advice to the government regarding the full implications of focusing on climate change or energy security. Policymakers, however, may choose to delegate these decisions, or a subset of them, to regulators; on the other hand, they may choose to remain silent on such issues. In the former case, of course, regulators have the power to exercise their discretion. In the latter case, the scope of regulatory discretion depends on what the legal system provides. In either case, the internal practices followed by the regulator need to provide legitimacy for regulatory rulings related to RE. Such practices include transparency and evidence-based decision-making.Frequently Asked Questions on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation,  Renewable energy lawyers  Renewable energy lawyers focus their practice on serving the legal needs of renewable energy project developers and companies that develop clean technologies (see clean tech law). Renewable energy laws by countryGermany= A chart summarizing German energy legislation is available. =Switzerland= :de:Energiegesetz (Schweiz) Renewable energy laws by technology Renewable energy laws can either be 'technology neutral' or provide specific assistance to particular selected groupings of renewable energy technology. Other aspects of land use planning law can have particular application to the implications of particular energy technologies, such as wind power. = Hydroelectric energy law = Conventional hydroelectric dams in most countries are highly regulated, with environmental reviews before construction and operational limits afterwards.https://www.ceaa- acee.gc.ca/050/documents/p63919/99173E.pdfhttps://www.ferc.gov/industries/hydropower/gen- info/regulation/hydro-prog.asp Operation normally places river conditions before power interest, ie: power generation may not be needed at night while rivers are kept flowing. = Geothermal energy law = Laws and Regulations Applicable to Geothermal Energy Development. ... A number of federal laws, regulations, and Executive Orders apply to geothermal energy development activities. For the most part, state laws and regulations do not apply to geothermal energy development on tribal lands = Wind energy law  Solar energy law =See also * Clean tech law * CleanTechDocs * Energy policy of the European Union * Environmental law * Green energy * Grid connection * Politics of energy transformation * Reverse auction * CleanTechLaw References de:Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz ","title":"Renewable energy law"},{"id":"18037408","text":"Nullawil is a locality in Victoria, Australia, located approximately from the state capital, Melbourne.

It featured Lon Chaney, Murdock MacQuarrie and Pauline Bush. This was Allan Dwan's last film for Universal, as he moved to New York afterward to work at the Famous Players Company and married his lead actress Pauline Bush in 1915. Originally released in March of 1914 at six reels in length (making it Chaney's first full-length feature), Universal eventually cut it down to four reels and put it out on Sept. 26, 1914 as part of its regular programme of pictures. Upon viewing the original 6-reel version, Moving Picture World had written in their review, \\"A six-reel production of the celebrated Cardinal Richelieu, following the lines of the famous play by that name.... The plot is a highly interesting one toward the close, but the action in the first three reels is rather slow and confusing. This would have been much stronger as either a three or four reel production.\\" The film is now considered to be lost. Neither the 6-reel nor the 4-reel version survives. Lombardi p.32-33 Plot In 17th-century France, Cardinal Richelieu sends Adrien de Mauprat, who is in love with Richelieu's ward Julie de Mortemar, off to fight the Spanish, as punishment for his disobedience in an earlier military conflict. Baradas (Lon Chaney), a favorite of King Louis XVI, is also in love with Julie, and envies de Mauprat's victories when he winds up winning in battle and returning home a hero. Baradas convinces de Mauprat that the cardinal is plotting against him and draws him into a scheme to kill the cardinal and seize the throne. Richelieu learns of the plot and De Mauprat is imprisoned and sentenced to be executed. Julie pleads for the release of her lover and winds up getting permission to marry him, and de Mauprat is released. Baradas is imprisoned instead, Julie winds up marrying de Mauprat, and Richelieu is restored to power. Cast * Murdock MacQuarrie as Cardinal Richelieu * William C.

It was written by Gangolf Jobb, a former researcher at the University of Munich, Germany, and was originally released in 2004. Treefinder is free of charge, though the most recent license prohibits its use in the USA and eight European countries.  Overview  A platform-independent graphical environment integrates a standard suite of analyses: phylogeny reconstruction, bootstrap analysis, model selection, hypothesis testing, tree calibration, manipulation of trees and sequence data. Treefinder is scriptable through a proprietary scripting language called TL. Treefinder has an efficient tree search algorithm that can infer trees with thousands of species within a short time. Result trees are displayed and can then be saved as a reconstruction report, which may serve as an input for further analysis, for example hypothesis testing. The report contains all information about the tree and the models used. Treefinder also supports exporting results as NEWICK or NEXUS files. The software supports a broad collection of models of sequence evolution. The June 2008 release implements 7 models of nucleotide substitution (HKY, TN, J1, J2, J3 (= TIM), TVM, GTR), 14 empirical models of amino acid substitution (BLOSUM, cpREV, Dayhoff, JTT, LG, mtArt, mtMam, mtREV, PMB, rtREV, betHIV, witHIV, VT, WAG), 4 substitution models of structured rRNA (bactRNA, eukRNA, euk23RNA, mitoRNA), the 6-state \\"Dayhoff Groups\\" protein model (DG), 2-state and 3-state models of DNA (GTR3, GTR2), a parametric mixed model (MIX) mixing the empirical models of proteins or rRNA, and also a user-definable GTR-type model (MAP) mapping characters to states as needed. Three models of among-site rate heterogeneity are available (Gamma, Gamma+I, I), which can be combined with any of the substitution models. One can assume different models for different partitions of a sequence alignment, and partitions may be assumed to evolve at different speeds. All parameters of the models can be estimated from the data by maximization of likelihood. Certain TL expressions, the \\"model expressions\\", allow the concise notation of complex models, together with their parameters and optimization modes. Treefinder's original publication from 2004 has been cited more than a thousand times in the scientific literature. Controversy On February 1, 2015, Jobb disallowed the use of Treefinder in the USA in order to make a political statement. The author again changed the license terms on October 1, 2015 to exclude use in Germany, Austria, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Sweden, and Denmark - countries he claimed \\"host most of the non-european immigrants\\". In an accompanying statement, he decried the handling of the European migrant crisis by European countries. The journal BMC Evolutionary Biology that published the original application note has since retracted it, stating that the license change violated the journal's policy.

Background  French marine infantryman in Tonkin, 1883 French intervention in northern Vietnam was precipitated by Commandant Henri Rivi√®re, who was sent with a small French military force to Hanoi at the end of 1881 to investigate Vietnamese complaints against the activities of French merchants.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 140‚Äì57 In defiance of the instructions of his superiors, Rivi√®re stormed the citadel of Hanoi on 25 April 1882.Bastard, 152‚Äì4; Marolles, 75‚Äì92; Nicolas, 249‚Äì52 Although Rivi√®re subsequently returned the citadel to Vietnamese control, his recourse to force was greeted with alarm in both Vietnam and China.Eastman, 51‚Äì7 The Vietnamese government, unable to confront Rivi√®re with its own ramshackle army, enlisted the help of Liu Yongfu, whose well-trained and seasoned Black Flag soldiers were to prove a thorn in the side of the French. The Vietnamese also bid for Chinese support. Vietnam had long been a vassal state of China, and China agreed to arm and support the Black Flags and to covertly oppose French operations in Tonkin. The Qing court also sent a strong signal to the French that China would not allow Tonkin to fall under French control. In the summer of 1882 troops of the Chinese Yunnan and Guangxi Armies crossed the border into Tonkin, occupying L·∫°ng S∆°n, B·∫Øc Ninh, H∆∞ng H√≥a and other towns.Marolles, 133‚Äì44; Lung Chang, 90‚Äì1 The French minister to China, Fr√©d√©ric Bour√©e, was so alarmed by the prospect of war with China that in November and December 1882 he negotiated a deal with the Chinese statesman Li Hongzhang to divide Tonkin into French and Chinese spheres of influence. Both negotiators were criticized for giving too much away, and the deal soon unravelled. It was never ratified in China, and in France Jules Ferry's incoming administration disavowed the agreement in March 1883 and recalled Bour√©e.Eastman, 57‚Äì65 Rivi√®re was disgusted at the deal cut by Bour√©e, and in early 1883 decided to force the issue. He had recently been sent a battalion of marine infantry from France, giving him just enough men to venture beyond Hanoi. On 27 March 1883, to secure his line of communications from Hanoi to the coast, Rivi√®re captured the citadel of Nam ƒê·ªãnh with a flotilla of gunboats and a force of 520 French soldiers under his personal command.Marolles, 178‚Äì92 The Battle of Gia Cuc was precipitated by an attempt by the Vietnamese commander Prince Ho√†ng K·∫ø Vi√™m, with limited assistance from Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army, to capture Hanoi from the French during Rivi√®re's absence at Nam ƒê·ªãnh with the bulk of the available French forces.  The battle  A French naval gun, deployed on a dyke, supports a marine infantry attack on the Vietnamese positions at Gia Cuc Chef de bataillon Berthe de Villers (1844‚Äì83) On 27 and 28 March the commander of the Hanoi garrison, chef de bataillon Berthe de Villers, sallied out against Prince Hoang's Vietnamese army, around 6,000 strong, with two companies of marine infantry and a small force of sailors from the gunboat L√©opard, leaving behind a single company of marine infantry to garrison the Royal Palace.The assault force under the command of Berthe de Villers included the 31st Company, 2nd Marine Infantry Regiment (Captain Caboureau) and the 30th Company, 4th Marine Infantry Regiment (Captain Martelli√®re). The sailors from L√©opard were commanded by enseignes de vaisseau Bladon and Le Bris. The Royal Palace was garrisonned by the 29th Company, 2nd Marine Infantry Regiment (Captain Retrouvey). Using intelligent fire and movement tactics and supported by L√©opard's artillery, the French attacked the Vietnamese defences, captured the villages of Gia Thuy and Gia Cuc, and finally drove the Vietnamese from the battlefield. French casualties were 4 men wounded. The Vietnamese may have lost as many as 1,000 dead and wounded.Bastard, 156‚Äì60; Marolles, 187‚Äì8; Duboc, 111‚Äì12; Huard, 26‚Äì30; Nicolas, 252‚Äì4; Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 54‚Äì5 One of the factors in the Vietnamese defeat was the absence of serious pressure on the French from Liu Yongfu (Liu Yung-fu, ÂäâÊ∞∏Á¶è) and the Black Flag Army. Liu was supposed to attack Hanoi from the west while Prince Hoang descended from the north. However, the two men were on the coolest of terms, and Liu made only a feint attack on the French-held Royal Palace. This attack was easily beaten off by the French garrison.  Significance  Berthe de Villers' remarkable victory at Gia Cuc, coupled with Rivi√®re's simultaneous Capture of Nam ƒê·ªãnh, demoralised the Vietnamese, appreciably raised French prestige in Tonkin, and emboldened French policymakers to shrug off the growing prospects of direct Chinese intervention in Tonkin. Meanwhile, the failure of cooperation between Prince Hoang and Liu Yongfu alarmed the Chinese. The senior Chinese civil mandarin Tang Jingsong (Tang Jingsong) reconciled the two men in April 1883, and persuaded Liu Yongfu to take the field against the French with the Black Flag Army. The result, in May 1883, was the disastrous French defeat at the Battle of Paper Bridge, in which both Rivi√®re and Berthe de Villers were killed.

An underwater bridge is a military structure that was employed during World War II and the Korean War. Underwater bridges, typically constructed of logs, sand and dirt just beneath the surface of the water in a river or similar narrow body of water, allow heavier vehicles to cross the river driving through only shallow water. Air reconnaissance finds such \\"bridges\\" difficult to spot; even if spotted, air strikes have difficulty in destroying them, as the water protects the structure from blasts. Soviet troops, notably Georgy Zhukov, used the concept during the Khalkhin Gol campaign (1939) and in World War II (1941-1945). North Korean troops also used such structures during the Korean War (1950-1953), particularly to cross the Naktong River during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter of August-September 1950. In the Vietnam War the Ho Chi Minh trail used such bridges.

Life Tettenborn first studied at the Waltershausen Forstwissenschaft and then at the Universities of G√∂ttingen and Jena. In 1794 he joined the Austrian military and quickly rose to captain during the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars. In the Austro-French war he was in 1805 in the army under Mack, which dispersed after raising the siege of Ulm. At the battle of Wagram (1809), he rose to the rank of major. After the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn he accompanied prince Schwarzenberg to Paris. At the outbreak of the Russian war of 1812, he entered the Russian army as a lieutenant colonel. At the head of Kutuzov's vanguard, he was again the first to engage at Moscow, pursuing the French as far as the Beresina at the head of the light cavalry, raising the siege of Vilnius, going beyond the Neman River, chasing MacDonald through East Prussia and occupying K√∂nigsberg. Appointed oberst, he crossed the Vistula and Oder, joined up with general Tschernischew in Landsberg and then moved on Berlin. From there, he was dispatched to Hamburg, occupying it on 18 March 1813 after throwing back Morand at Bergedorf on the left bank of the Elbufer. Yet he had to leave the city to the advancing Davout on 30 May. His actions in Hamburg are judged critically. Fahl writes of von Tettenborn at this era \\"he observed Hamburg as a favourable location to enrich itself and to lead a straying life. He strove less for an earnest defence of the city than for collecting of an honorary award of 5,000 Friedriches d'or and for his appointment as an honorary citizen he was also the first honorary citizen of Hamburg.\\" Andreas Fahl, Das Hamburger B√ºrgermilit√§r 1814-1868;Berlin 1987, S. 24f m.w.Nw. He then fought under Wallmoden against Davout and against P√©cheux, after whose defeat he took Bremen on 15 October. In January 1814 he was delegated to use a single corps of light cavalry to maintain communications between the many separate Allied armies operating in France. After the peace, he withdrew to his estates, and in 1818 he left the service of Russia to join that of Baden. Here he resolved the territorial differences between Baden and Bayern and was active in the foundation of the constitution. In 1819 he went to Vienna as an envoy, where he died on 9 December 1845.

In the dream, Pan's daughter lures the faun away from his beloved wood-nymph with her magic flute. When he awakens from his dream, he decides to capture the image of Pan's daughter on canvas and goes in search of a suitable model. He meets Caprice, a dancer who strangely resembles Pan's daughter as seen in his dream. Stephen convinces the girl to pose for him and he soon becomes entranced by her.

Members include telecommunications networking and service provider companies, broadband device and equipment vendors, consultants and independent testing labs (ITLs). Service provider members are primarily wire-line service providers (non- mobile) telephone companies. History The DSL Forum was founded in 1994 with about 200 member companies in different divisions of the telecommunication and information technology sector. It is used as a platform for companies that operate in the broadband market. Its initial main purpose was the establishment of new standards around digital subscriber line communication products such as provisioning. This cooperation has brought different standardizations for ADSL, SHDSL, VDSL, ADSL2+ and VDSL2. The group was established in 1994 as the ADSL Forum, but became the DSL Forum in 1999, named after the digital subscriber line (DSL) family of technology. Among its early design documents, the Forum created TR-001 (1996) system reference model, which together with later TR-012 (1999) core network architecture, recommended PPP over an ATM transport layer as the best practice for a DSL ISP. This was subsequently refined in TR-025 and TR-059. Starting in 2004, the Forum expanded its work into other last mile technologies including optical fiber. On 17 June 2008 it changed its name to \\"Broadband Forum\\". DSL-related specifications, while still a key part of the forum's work, are no longer its only work. For instance, the forum produced work specific to passive optical networking (PON). Its Auto-Configuration Server specification TR-069, originally published in 2004, was adapted for use with set-top box and Network Attached Storage units. The Forum's TR-101 specification (2006) documents migration toward an Ethernet-based DSL aggregation model (Ethernet DSLAMs). In May 2009, IP/MPLS Forum merged with the Broadband Forum. It had promoted the frame relay and Multiprotocol Label Switching technologies. Technical work of IP/MPLS Forum continued in a newly created \\"IP/MPLS and Core\\" Working Group of the Broadband Forum. The historical specifications from the IP/MPLS Forum's predecessors, ATM Forum, Frame Relay Forum, MFA Forum, and MPLS Forum, are archived on the Broadband Forum's website, under IP/MPLS Forum specifications. Broadband Forum issued Femto Access Point Service Data Model TR-196 during April 2009 and version 2 released during November 2011.

Note how despite being a right-handed batsmen, he has assumed the grip and stance of a left-handed batsman. A switch hit is a modern cricket shot. A switch hit involves effectively changing from a right-hander to a left-hander just before the ball is delivered by the bowler for the purpose of executing the shot. It is a variation of the reverse sweep, in which the stance is changed during the bowler's delivery action, and has been compared to switch-hitting in baseball. The shot is usually attributed to Kevin Pietersen. Pietersen played the shot for the first time off Muttiah Muralitharan in a test match against Sri Lanka in May 2006, and used it again on 15 June 2008 in a one-day international against New Zealand. Despite the shot becoming known due to Pietersen's successful execution of it, it is believed that Jonty Rhodes actually executed this shot before Pietersen: he hit a switch-hit six off Darren Lehmann in a one day international between Australia and South Africa on March 27, 2002. However, Krishnamachari Srikanth played a switch hit for four off Dipak Patel in India's last league match of the 1987 world cup against NZ on 31st October 1987. Australia's David Warner is a notable user of this shot and was endorsed to use a double-faced bat in Twenty20 cricket. The shot was innovated by Pietersen using which he hit 2 sixes in the cover region. The shot is executed by changing stance from a right-handed to a left-handed batsman or vice versa during the bowler's run-up and hitting it in the cover (midwicket to a left-hander) region. The shot has generated debate in the cricket world, some heralding it as an outstanding display of skill and others arguing that if the batsman changes stance he gains an unfair advantage over the bowler, because the field is set based on the batsman's initial stance at the crease.http://www.setanta.com/en/Sport/News/Other-sports/2008/06/16/Cricket- MCC-to-investigate-KP/?facets/sport-space/great-britain-locale/cricket/ The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), guardians of the laws of cricket, has confirmed it will not legislate against the switch shot and cited that the shot was perfectly legal in accordance with cricketing laws.Mcc Examines Switch shot The MCC believes that the stroke is exciting for the game of cricket, and highlighted Law 36.3 which defines the off side of the striker's wicket as being determined by his stance at the moment the bowler starts his run- up.Kevin Pietersen switch shot approved by MCC The MCC has also acknowledged that the switch hit has implications on the interpretation of the 'on side' and 'off side' for the purposes of adjudicating on wides or leg before wicket decisions. In June 2012, the International Cricket Council (ICC) committee declared it to be a legitimate shot. They issued a statement saying they have decided to make no change to the current regulations. On the other hand, if defined by baseball equivalent, where a player change stance before even facing the ball, players that are able to bat both left handed and right handed straight up (notably David Warner) do not actually change handedness in the course of a match.

By order of the Privy Council, with their feet tied beneath their horses' bellies, they were carried in public disgrace up to London and back again to Lancaster, where they were condemned and executed for their priesthood. The local population showed their disapproval, and their relics were carried off after their death.

The Times, Tuesday, Sep 29, 1925; pg. 18; Issue 44079 This new Fourteen substantially increased Hillman's market share and remained on sale into 1931. During this time it was the main product of the company. Late 1920s fashion when engines and other mechanicals were firmly fixed to the chassis decreed that a medium-sized car like the Fourteen should be given a six-cylinder engine to reduce vibration. So the 2-litre Fourteen's place was taken by the 2.1-litre six-cylinder Hillman Wizard 65 in April 1931. This Wizard 65 was itself dropped in 1933. The 2.8-litre Wizard 75 continued re-named 20/70 alongside a 2.6-litre Sixteen and a 3.2-litre Hawk, all of six cylinders. For four years Hillman had no offering in the 2-litre slot. The six-cylinder cars were not as successful as had been expected and in October 1937 a new 2-litre 4-cylinder Hillman Fourteen with a handsome new body filled their previous place in the Hillman range. Hillman now offered just their Minx and this new Fourteen. In 1946 production resumed but the former Hillman Fourteens were now given a protruding boot lid and no running boards and badged Humber Hawk. New market segment 1927 Weymann-style tourer In the early 1920s Hillman had concentrated on smaller cars with the 10 and 11 hp models but with their 14 horsepower car they entered the larger sized class taking on the Austin 12 hp and Humber 14/40. The new Hillman was priced at ¬£345 for the saloon, undercutting the Austin which sold for ¬£455, it was advertised as \\"the car that costs less than it should\\". ;Engine The engineering was largely conventional with a 72 x 120 mm long stroke, monobloc, side-valve 1954 cc, four-cylinder 35 bhp engine built in-unit with a four- speed gearbox and spiral bevel geared rear axle. ;Chassis Four wheel, cable operated, drum brakes were fitted from the start but unusually a vacuum servo was an option. The handbrake had its own set of shoes on the rear brakes. The steel section chassis had semi-elliptic leaf springs all round. In a test by The Autocar magazine, the top speed was around and fuel consumption 23-24 mpg. ;Bodies A range of bodies were offered including saloons and tourers. The cars were well fitted out and spacious with a right-hand gear change by the driver's door, a feature regarded as up-market at the time. Safety glass was fitted in the windows of the 1928 Safety Saloon. Wire spoked or artillery wheels could be specified. A V-windscreened landaulette was advertised in 1927. Standard equipment included: clock, speedometer, oil gauge, screen wiper, driving mirror, shaded dash-lamp, licence holder, rug rail, floor carpets etc.The Hillman Motor Car Co., Ltd. The Times, Wednesday, Mar 17, 1926; pg. v; Issue 44222 =Road test= In early January 1925 The Times motoring correspondent described the new Hillman's engine as lively enough, quiet and vibration-free but the suspension was hard. There was no undue grumble or hum from the gears. All the controls including steering and brakes were said to work well and the seats, front and back, described as comfortable. The car's maximum speed over level ground was said to be 50-55 mph.Cars Of To-Day. The Times, Tuesday, Jan 05, 1926; pg. 10; Issue 44161 ;Update September 1927 Following two years of production improvements were introduced in September 1927 for that year's motor show. The wheelbase was lengthened by but not the car's overall length. The steering was improved for a smoother and lighter action and the column rake was now adjustable. The front brake cables were replaced with rods. The engine received larger crankshaft and connecting rod bearings and an anti-detonating (\\"anti-knock\\") design adopted for the cylinder head. A Weymann fabric bodied 4-light 4-door sports saloon (as chosen for personal use by Henry Segrave) with safety glass option and a 6-light Safety saloon (fitted with Triplex safety glass) joined the range. The artillery wheel option was dropped. Dipping headlights were a new feature. Separate seats replaced the front bench seat and both back and front seats were widened. There were also changes to the mudguards and running boards. The export car was widened to inches and its track to inches. A water- impeller and a large top radiator tank were also fitted to export cars.Motor- Car Prices.

A new deeper radiator appeared in early September 1928 with larger headlamps on a cross-bar between the wings. The wider bodies had been lowered three inches without reducing ground clearance or head clearance. The body range was rationalised to a standard saloon, fabric saloon, Segrave coup√©, tourer and Huski (sic) fabric-bodied sports tourer. There were major changes to a strengthened chassis and an increase in the track of the home market cars from to . Other upgrades included a stronger Hardy-Spicer propellor shaft with metal joints, more powerful brakes and shock absorbers all round. An oil pressure gauge was added to the dashboard.Motor-Cars For 1929. The Times, Friday, Sep 07, 1928; pg. 9; Issue 44992 ;October 1929 For 1930 a stronger frame was provided together with longer springs employing Silentbloc spring shackles and improved brakes.The Motor Show. The Times, Saturday, Oct 19, 1929; pg. 7; Issue 45338 ;Olympia Motor Show October 1930 Three Fourteens were on Hillman's stand, a 2-door drop head coup√©, a 4-door safety tourer and a 6-light Weymann saloon with a sunshine roof. Front seats could now slide for adjustment and a petrol gauge was provided on the instrument panel. The brakes receive servo assistance on the safety model. All the cars displayed had safety glass.The Olympia Show. The Times, Saturday, Oct 18, 1930; pg. 17; Issue 45647.

All new car ;Olympia October 1937 First displayed at the Olympia Motor Show in October 1937 some of its thunder was stolen by the \\"Ghost Minx\\" displayed beside it. Holes had been cut in the Minx's body and replaced by Perspex panels. ;Body The new 2-litre Hillman Fourteen was a much prettier car than their Minx's sole remaining stable-mate their 3.2-litre Hawk which it replaced. It was a straightforward, in essence simple, design for an economical four-cylinder car. Full use had been made of the wheelbase and track so five passengers may be carried in comfort. There were six side- windows and swivelling quarter lights in the leading edges of the front windows. Further air was supplied through a ventilator in the scuttle. The de luxe model's sliding roof was steel like the rest of the body. Passengers' feet were not restricted by footwells. Lockable luggage space at the back of the car was considered adequate, the spare wheel was carried in a separate compartment below the luggage. The windscreen could be opened high enough for a clear view in fog. Two wipers were fitted and three swivelling ashtrays. Front seats slide forward and back. { Rootes Group's Evenkeel front suspension ;Brakes, steering and suspension The brakes were made by Bendix- Cowdrey. They were mechanically operated and self-energising with 11 inch diameter drums. Rear suspension is by semi-elliptic springs but the front Evenkeel independent suspension was by transverse leaf springs. Steering was by a worm and nut device. Engine power was transmitted from the gearbox to the half-floating rear axle through a needle bearing open propellor shaft and a spiral bevel final drive. A system of jacking points was built-in. The Motor Show. The Times, Monday, Oct 18, 1937; pg. 20; Issue 47818 } { registered April 1939 Humber Hawk registered Nov 1946 } =New engine= The new engine was a return to the medium-sized simpler and more efficient 4-cylinder type rather than the 6-cylinder engines fashionable earlier in the 1930s. It had been given an oil bath air cleaner and an automatic choke for the downdraught carburettor. The valves were mounted to one side of the block and operated by pushrods. Cooling water was circulated by an impellor and the amount of cooling provided by the radiator was regulated by thermostat. The design, then displacing 1669 cc, was a scaled down version of the Snipe's engine first used in Humber's Twelve of 1933 and now bored out to 75 mm.Michael Sedgwick, Cars of the 1930s, Batsford, London1970 The engine, the clutch and the gearbox were mounted together on rubber which allowed them to rock and so absorb vibration. Accordingly the driver's engine controls were provided by cables. Claimed output was 51 bhp at 3,600 rpm. The tax rating was just under 14 horsepower. The engine continued in the Humber Hawk range and Sunbeam-Talbot and Sunbeam Alpine ranges. Converted for the Sunbeam-Talbot alone to overhead valves from July 1948A New Sunbeam-Talbot.

The Times (London, England), Tuesday, May 10, 1955; pg. 7; Issue 53216and remained in production for the Hawk until production ended in 1968. =Road test= Eighteen months after the new car's announcement The Times published a road test. Their motoring correspondent liked the new smooth clean look. He described the car as inexpensive and said it was easy to control and displayed quick power and smoothness. Altogether, he said, there was much to commend though the syncromesh required a short pause before engagement and under certain circumstances braking could affect the steering. The suspension was described as excellent, a rear passenger travelled in comfort without being tossed about on bad surfaces. 50 mph was easily maintained without scurry and 67 mph was the Hillman's mean maximum speed. ;Luxury sports saloon variant At the end of August 1939 it was announced the shape of the Sunbeam- Talbot Ten would be used on the Hillman Fourteen's engine and running gear to make a new car. It was badged Sunbeam-Talbot 2 Litre and was available as a 4-light sports saloon, a 4-seater sports tourer, a drop head foursome coup√© and a sports 2-seater. The new coachwork was of steel and ash on a shorter wheelbase and narrower track.New Sunbeam-Talbot Car. The Times, Wednesday, Aug 30, 1939; pg. 8; Issue 48397.

The film is now considered to be lost. Plot Carlotta, born into a poor family, is adopted by the wealthy nobleman Don Velasquez (Chaney). She grows up with her step-brother Don Manuel, and when they reach adulthood, they fall in love with each other. Don Velasquez doesn't approve of the union however. The son goes off to join the king's court for a time and when he returns six years later, he brings with him a wife and son. Carlotta develops an intense hatred for all of them, and later when she sees the young boy in a perilous situation, balancing on a window sill as he reaches out for a rose, she does nothing and allows the child to plummet to his death. Realizing the gravity of what she has done, Carlotta repents by entering a convent and becoming a nun. From the window of her cell, she arranges it so that she can see the child's gravestone, only magnifying her sense of guilt. Thirteen years later, Carlotta confesses what she did to Sister Agnes, and tells her how every year on the anniversary of his death, the little boy's ghost appears before her, with a cross of blood on his forehead. When the anniversary arrives the next day, the ghost appears again and this time holds out his arms to her. She recognizes the ghost as the Christ child and realizes that God has forgiven her, because she confessed her sin to Sister Agnes the day before.
