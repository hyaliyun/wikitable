Outside psychotherapeutic circles, she is better known by her pseudonym, Joanna Field, as a pioneer of introspective journaling. Biography Milner was born in Kensington, London, as Nina Marion Blackett, the daughter of Arthur Stuart Blackett, a stockbroker, and his wife, Caroline Frances Maynard. She was the sister of Nobel physicist Patrick Blackett. She studied at University College, London, where she graduated with a 1st Class degree in psychology in 1924. In 1926, Milner began an introspective journey that later became one of her best-known books, A Life of One's Own (initially published under the name Joanna Field in 1934). This started as a journal in which she would note down times that she felt happy and thoughts going through her head at those times, in an attempt to discover what happiness was; however, her introspection branched out into other areas, from an analysis of day-to-day worries to experiences which some reviewers described as \\"mystical\\".Joanna Field (Marion Milner), A Life of One's Own 2nd ed. (London: Chatto & Windus, 1936, reprinted New York: Puttnam, 1981). Milner's basic technique is a kind of introspection, observing fleeting thoughts (\\"butterfly thoughts\\", as she calls them) combined with an openness to sensory experience that she calls \\"wide awareness\\". A Life of One's Own was well-received, attracting favorable reviews from such literary notables as W. H. Auden and Stephen Spender, and soon afterwards, she published a work on similar lines (again as Joanna Field), An Experiment in Leisure.Joanna Field (Marion Milner), An Experiment in Leisure (Los Angeles: J. P. Tarcher, 1937, reprinted New York: St. Martin‚Äôs Press, 1987). During this period, Milner became increasingly interested in Jean Piaget and the work of Jungian analytical psychologists. Here she was particularly interested in what she originally termed \\"bisexuality\\", but would now perhaps be better called psychological androgyny, and also investigated Eastern philosophies such as Taoism. In 1940, she started training as a psychoanalyst undergoing analysis with Sylvia Payne, and training with Joan Riviere and Ella Sharpe.Mary Jacobus The poetics of psychoanalysis: in the wake of Klein She began practicing psychoanalysis in 1943, and became a prominent member of the Independent Group. Her best-known work on psychoanalysis, The Hands of the Living God,Marion Milner, The Hands of the Living God (New York: International Universities Press, 1969). relates her own lengthy treatment of a psychotic patient and the insights she gained into her own mind. She made considerable use of painting and doodling in her therapy and was also an enthusiastic painter herself; her observations on the benefits of painting were published as On Not Being Able to Paint.Marion Milner, On Not Being Able to Paint (Madison, Conn.: International Universities Press, Inc., 1950). Milner married Dennis Milner in 1927; they had one son named John. Dennis died in 1954. Milner died in London on 29 May 1998.

It is usually translated in English as High Constable. The institution of spaspet, like its rough equivalent sparapet in neighboring Armenia, was designed under the influence of the Sassanian Persian spahbed, but differed in that it was a non-hereditary rank and included not only military, but also civil functions.Robert Bedrosian, \\"Sparapet\\", in: Joseph Reese Strayer (1983), Dictionary of the Middle Ages, p. 460. Scribner, . According to the medieval Georgian chronicles, the rank of spaspet was introduced by the first king P‚Äôarnavaz in the 3rd century BC. At the same time, it served as ex officio duke of Inner Iberia (Shida Kartli), around Mtskheta and Uplis-Tsikhe. It seems that this office was in fact occupied by the member of the Iberian royal family or an especially high dignitary next in seniority to the king. The Roman geographer Strabo (63/4 BC-AD 24) attests that in the royal hierarchy of Iberia \\"the second in line administers justice and commands the army.\\" It is also possible to equate these dignitaries with the Iberian viceroys (pitiakhsh) whose hereditary necropolis was uncovered in Armazi.David M.

Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), p. 299. When the rhyme reappeared later in the nineteenth century, it took the now common form: :To market, to market, to buy a fat hen, :Home again, home again, jiggety-jig. :To market, to market, to buy a fat hog, :Home again, home again, jiggety-jog. :To market, to market to buy a plum cake, :Home again, home again, market is late. :To market, to market, to buy a plum bun, :Home again, home again, market is done. :To market, to market to buy a fat dog, :Home again, home again, jiggety jog. :To market, to market to buy a small chick, :Home again, home again, jiggety jig. There have been many variations such as this reworking: :To market, to market, to buy a fat pig! :Home with it! home with it! jiggety jig! :Stuff it till Christmas and make a fat hog, :Then at Smithfield Show win a prize, jiggety jog! Origins The rhyme is first recorded in part in John Florio's, A Worlde of Wordes, or Most Copious, and exact Dictionarie in Italian and English, published in 1598, which defines \\"Abomba\\" as 'a man's home or resting place: home againe, home againe'. The 1611 edition is even clearer, referring to \\"the place where children playing hide themselves ...Also as we used to say Home againe home againe, market is done.\\" We do not have records again until the following version was printed in Songs for the Nursery (1805): :To market, to market, to buy a penny bun, :Home again, home again, market is done.

Pelaw Main Map Pelaw Main is a hamlet a few kilometres south-west of Kurri Kurri, in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia. It owes its origins entirely to the colliery there of the same name. It had a population of 1,027 in 2011 Pelaw Main Colliery About 1900 the coal mining firm of J & A Brown purchased the leasehold of the proposed Stanford Greta No. 2 Colliery from the East Greta Coal Mining Company and soon afterwards changed the name of the property to Pelaw Main. By 1901 they had driven two tunnels into the 17 foot seam of coal there. They then constructed a railway extension westwards from the terminus of the South Maitland Railways branch line at Victoria Street, Stanford Merthyr, to Pelaw Main, a distance of about one mile, which opened for traffic on 17 November 1901. A brick-faced passenger platform was built at Reception Road, Pelaw Main, but passenger traffic ceased in 1932 with the scaling down of the branch from Aberdare Junction on the South Maitland Railways coupled with the fact that from 1918 coal from the Stanford Merthyr Colliery was being transported via the Richmond Vale Railway. In addition, the SMR branch was abandoned altogether by 1940 following major subsidence beneath it, leaving the Richmond Vale Railway to service fully Stanford Merthyr and Pelaw Main. Pelaw Main Colliery was a major concern and large employer. By 1902 there were four coal loading 'roads' which accommodated sufficient wagons to hold 4000 tons of coal at any one time. Richmond Vale Railway was extended to form a main link, past the South Maitland Cemetery, to the South Maitland Railways at Weston Exchange Sidings near the eastern end of Weston Railway Station, the link being completed in 1936. This meant that in the unlikely event that the Richmond Vale Railway was blocked an alternative route for coal trains was available. The link was occasionally used when flooding blocked one, but not both rail lines-it was rare for both lines to be blocked at the same time. In 1922 a direct railway line was constructed between Pelaw Main and Richmond Vale and passenger trains were run to convey miners to and from each mine. Pelaw Main Colliery closed in 1962 owing to the major coal industry slump at that time. Recent history Pelaw Main has not changed much since the closing of the colliery. The population stays fairly small, recorded at 836 people in 2006 (a 1% growth since the 2001 census). The town had a small general store, but it has since closed. Most shopping is now done in nearby Kurri Kurri. It also has a primary school, which was established in 1903. Most of the students continue education in Kurri Kurri High School, while others may enrol in one of the high schools closer to Cessnock. A direct railway line was constructed in 1922 between Pelaw Main and Richmond Vale for the conveyance of miners to and from their shifts. In recent times this line has been rebuilt by the Richmond Vale Railway Museum and until damaged by a bush fire in 2017 was part of its regular tourist/enthusiast heritage train services. The bush fire damage is being remediated.

Family and early life =Family= Fraser was born during the Age of Enlightenment at Tomnacross, the Aird, Inverness-shire on 14 October 1750. His father was Donald Fraser, (a.k.a. Donald Down, a patronymic descriptive of hair colour traditional amongst the Scots Highlanders); his mother was Mary McLean, and his siblings included a brother James (b. 16 March 1753) and sister Christiana (b. 5 December 1756). Fraser's eldest son John Jr. (c. 1779-1852) continued in his father's footsteps as a plant hunter after Fraser's death and became a respected nurseryman in his own right (ALS 1848).Fraser, Don, , website by the descendants of John Fraser, last update 22 October 2007. Accessed 31 July 2012. John Jr. also owned the Hermitage Nursery at Ramsgate (1817-1835) and when he retired he sold his nursery to William Curtis in 1835. John Jr. met with the celebrated American botanist Asa Gray in 1839, early on in Gray's career, and ultimately sold the Fraser herbarium to the Linnean Society in 1849. Fraser's younger son James Thomas directed the family nursery at Chelsea with his older brother until 1811 and then on his own until 1827. Fraser's grandson John became a member of the Royal Horticultural Society, attending meetings in 1877. =Early life= In 1770, five years before the American War of Independence and coincident with Captain James Cook's discovery of the eastern Australian coast, Fraser arrived in London as a young man to make his way in the city, at first following the trade of a hosier (a draper working with linen). He soon came to know the Chelsea Physic Garden, and it was through his visits there that he became inspired with a desire to advance horticulture in England. He married Frances Shaw on 21 June 1778 and settled down in a small shop in Paradise Bow, Chelsea. Starting out Campbell's ship H.M.S. Victory Not long content with life in London, Fraser soon began to quit the mercantile counter as often as he could to watch the gardeners at work. He befriended William Forsyth who at that time had charge of the Apothecaries' Garden; through that acquaintance he would have become familiar with his predecessor Mark Catesby's travels, as some of Catesby's specimens from his travels were housed at the Chelsea Physic Garden, and Catesby's writings and engravings on the flora of the Americas were also published by the time Fraser moved to London. Fraser took up botanical collecting and, two years after the United States of America had named itself, departed England for Newfoundland in 1780 with Admiral Campbell. Upon returning to England, he sailed again in 1783 to explore the New World with his eldest son John Jr. Fraser's early expeditions were financed by William Aiton of Kew Gardens, William Forsyth, and James Edward Smith of the Linnean Society.British Museum, Fraser, John (1750‚Äì1811), Database of Plant Collectors, plants.jstor.org. Accessed 5 August 2012 In the 1780s Fraser established the American Nursery at Sloane Square, King's Road, which his sons continued after his death in partnership from 1811-1817. The nursery was on the east side of the Royal Military School and extended over twelve acres. Travels United States of North America (William Faden 1793) As the 18th century came to a close, botanists who hunted plants afar were adventurers and explorers, John Fraser among them, fielding shipwrecks, sieges, slavery, pirates, escaped convicts and hostile natives., Scottish Plant Hunters Garden, pitlochry.org.uk, 21 June 2009. Accessed 4 August 2012. Fraser travelled extensively, from Scotland to England, the Americas, the West Indies, Russia, and points between.

By the time he completed his journeys, John Fraser had introduced about 220 distinct species of plants from the Americas to Europe and beyond. =Appalachia and the Alleghenies= Fraser made his first trip to the American south, and specifically to Charleston, South Carolina in 1783 or 1784,Loudon, J.C., Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum, (53 MB file from archive.org), v. 1, 2nd ed., 1854, London, Henry G.

Returning to England in 1785 with the expectation of recompense for his labour and risk, he was astonished to learn that all the valuable plants he had forwarded were dead, and the survivors, which were common, could not be disposed of. Vexed, Fraser subsequently entered into a lawsuit over the matter, a suit long and very expensive to both parties, but sailed again for South Carolina in the autumn nonetheless. On his return trip that autumn he made his way north through Berkeley County to the Santee River, befriending Thomas Walter along the way.Rembert, David H. Jr., The Botanical Explorations of William Bartram , bartramtrail.org, 22 February 2012 (last update). Accessed 31 July 2012.

This last voyage was undertaken in consequence of an ukase of their late imperial Majesties the Emperor and Empress of all the Russias, appointing him their Botanical Collector. We trust that so much zeal will meet with a due reward.\\" and in 1787 arrived in Pickens County near Chickamaua Cherokee land during the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars. There he collected what became known later as Magnolia fraseri. Fraser gave his contemporary William Bartram his original specimen of Magnolia fraseri; the specimen is housed in the Walter Herbarium in the British Museum of Natural History collection. The Hortus Kewensis recorded 16 new plants as having been introduced by Fraser in 1786, and five more in 1787. Fraser trekked the Allegheny Mountains in 1789 when trans-Allegheny travel was limited to indigenous peoples' trails and one military trail, Braddock Road, built in 1751 and too far north of his journeys to be of help. He travelled with Fran√ßois Andr√© Michaux, and on the summit of the Great Roan was the first European to discover the Rhododendron catawbiense, now cultivated in many varieties. Of the rhododendrons he wrote \\"We supplied ourselves with living plants, which were transmitted to England, all of which grew, and were sold for five guineas each.\\" Charleston nursery Fraser was the first European to collect Rhododendron catawbiense John's brother James was actively involved with the American side of Fraser's plant export-import business, and from at least 1791 they jointly leased some land in Charleston until May 1800. In 1796, the brothers additionally mortgaged 406 acres on Johns Island along the marshy edge of Stono River, originally a part of the Fenwick Hall estate. The brothers had difficulties with their land deals though, and in 1798 they fell behind in their payment obligations to the extent that their creditors instituted litigation to collect past due sums. Despite their problems with lawsuits, leases, mortgages, and land too marshy to be perfectly suited to their enterprise, in 1810, the year prior to Fraser's death, large numbers of rhododendrons, magnolias, and other native plants were still being shipped from the Fraser brothers' Charleston nursery by their agents there. =Russia and shipwreck= In 1795 Fraser made a first visit to Saint Petersburg where he sold a choice collection of plants to the Empress Catherine; to his delight she requested he set his own price. While there, he bought Black and White Tartarian cherries in 1796, thereafter introducing them for the first time to England. In 1797 Czar Paul I ordered that Fraser be paid 4,000 rubles for his plants that year, and by the next spring, Fraser had received ¬£500 sterling for his efforts. In 1798 Fraser travelled again to Russia, returning afterward with the commission Botanical Collector to the Emperor Paul, under the signature of each Paul and Catherine and dated Pavlovskoe, August, 1798. Based on his trust in the Imperial commission and in furtherance of carrying out the duties it imposed upon him, Fraser and his eldest son John started out once more in 1799, bound for America and the West Indies. They visited with Thomas Jefferson at Monticello and made an extended journey through Kentucky, eastern Tennessee, and northern Georgia, returning to Charleston in December 1800. From there they set out for Cuba, but the sailing was a perilous one since between Havana and the United States they were shipwrecked on a coral reef, about from land and from Havana, escaping only with great difficulty. \\"For six days they, with sixteen of the crew, endured the greatest privations until picked up by a Spanish boat and conveyed to land.\\" The trip was nearly disastrous and the men barely escaped with their lives. =Cuba= While collecting specimens in Cuba, \\"a time when the sea [was] swarming with pirates\\",Letter from Humboldt to Willdenow, Havana, February 21, 1801. Lettres am√©ricaines, √©d. Hamy, pp. 107-109. Fraser met the explorers Alexander von Humboldt and Aim√© Bonpland on their circuitous journey from the Amazon to Cartagena. John's son returned to England first, transporting a large botanical collection of Humboldt's after he had kindly intervened on their behalf during their sojourn to keep them safe. Fraser returned from Cuba to America and then to England in 1801 or 1802 with \\"a goodly collection of rarities,\\"Brendel and the Journal of Horticulture (1877) differ as to whether the return trip was made in 1801 or 1802; they also differ on the birthdate of his son John. Several of the references differ as to where John Fraser died, and whether he was 60 or 61 at his death. one of which was his discovery (as a European) of Jatropha pandurifolia. In 1807, both father and son again sailed for North America and the West Indies. On his next trip to London after collecting in Matanzas, Fraser brought home a tropical palm with silvered leaves, Corypha miraguama,Humboldt et Bonpland, Corypha miraguama, Nov. Gen., 1816, 1, p. 298. Accessed 4 August 2012. and made a manufacturing proposal for hand-weaving of hats and bonnets from its leaves; Fraser's sister Christiana \\"Christy\\" Fraser, opened an establishment for the purpose under the Queen's patronage (the Queen herself was an amateur botanist) and employed a number of people, but the scheme ultimately failed, possibly through scarcity of material. Abies frasieri (Fraser Fir), named for John Fraser, is native to the southeastern Appalachian Mountains. =Business difficulties= When Fraser made his next visit to the Romanov court in 1805 expecting remuneration, to his great disappointment he discovered that the new Emperor would have nothing to do with him. Undaunted, he repeated the trip, visiting both Moscow and Saint Petersburg, but in vain. After the Emperor Paul I's assassination in March, 1801, the new Emperor Alexander I declined to recognise Fraser's appointment. Fraser petitioned his cause for two years, finally resorting to seeking assistance from the British ambassadorial corps, and was ultimately paid 6,000 rubles by royal decree in April, 1803. The Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, an enthusiastic amateur botanist herself, supported his efforts, giving him a diamond ring and commissioning him for specimens for the Imperial Gardens of Gatchina and Pavlovsk Palace. The director of the Imperial Botanic Garden at Saint Petersburg catalogued 18 of Fraser's North American species in the early years of the 19th century, with some of the specimens surviving as of 1997 in the Komarov Botanical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. After the Romanov affair, Fraser faced severe financial difficulty, though again he sailed to America. While successful in his researches there, his nursery at home fell into neglect through his absence and money problems. His financial situation may have affected his relationship with his brother James, since in 1809 Fraser sued his brother as former business partner in the Charleston Court of Common Pleas for debts exceeding ¬£1,042.John Fraser vs James Fraser, Case 52-A, Charleston County Court of Common Pleas (now the Ninth Circuit, South Carolina Circuit Court), Judgement Rolls, 1810, South Carolina Dept. of Archives and History, Columbia, S.C.; noted by Simpson, et al., p. 5. =Later voyages= Fraser made his seventh and last voyage to the United States in 1807. Near Charleston he fell from his horse and broke several of his ribs, an injury from which he never fully recovered. His final voyage before returning to England was from America to Cuba in 1810 for a last visit to a country that welcomed him despite the nationalistic differences of the day, and from which he had a richly rewarding collecting history. Death Although he was known to his contemporaries as \\"John Fraser, the indefatigable\\", owing to his business and travel vexations and possibly also to exhaustion from his injuries after his fall, and his frequent and fatiguing journeys, his life was shortened -- though a robust man, he died in April, 1811 in London, Sloane Square,Or he died in Glasgow -- the family account of his death place (and the Hogg article) differs from the accounts published in Brendel and Ward. at only 60, leaving two sons; his wife died a few years afterwards. He did live long enough to see one grandchild, William, born to John Jr. and his wife Sarah on 30 June 1808, and more offspring came later from both his sons. Fraser's financial difficulties must have been a heavy burden to his family even after he died, since two years afterward he was declared to have been bankrupt at his death. Fraser did take care of his family though, as the terms of his will gave his unmarried sister Christy a place in his home and financial aid from his sons; in 1818 Christy was still receiving her support as specified by that will. Legacy Throughout his travels, Fraser sent his collections to his nursery in London for reproduction and general sale to gardeners and architects coming to London to look for plants; to his herbarium (later becoming that of the Linnean Society) for further study; and to his clients, including Catherine the Great, the Emperor Paul I, the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, the Chelsea Physic Garden, William Aiton (head gardener of Kew Gardens), Sir James Edward Smith (founder of the Linnean Society), and others.Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London, Academic Press, biodiversitylibrary.org, 1906-9, p. 15.

Also, the article Art of the Moment, Black and White Magazine, newspaperarchive.com, 18 January 1908, p. 16, (requires Flash plugin) shows two portraits of Fraser, one by Hoppner and the other by Sir Henry Raeburn, and both are entitled as such.

Though Fraser died young, his sons carried on their father's work; John Jr. returned to America where he continued his own botanic excursions until 1817 before returning to England and founding his own nursery. Fraser was hailed early on by his biographers as \\"[O]ne of the most enterprising, indefatigable, and persevering men that ever embarked in the cause of botany and natural science.\\" Magnolia fraseri, named for John Fraser Species named for Fraser Species named after Fraser include, among others, Abies fraseri (Fraser Fir), Magnolia fraseri (Fraser Magnolia), and the gentianworts, Frasera.

In addition, we've supplied a bit more suspense to the bus ride. A landslide which just misses the bus for example, and a bridge going out under the weight of the vehicle.

Reception The film received disappointing reviews. Fox had hoped to repeat the success of 1956's Bus Stop (starring Marilyn Monroe), but ended up crafting the Steinbeck novel into what one commentator called \\"the kind of lowbrow schlock the novel had satirized\\". United Press International wrote in a review of the film that Michaels' \\"torrid\\" scene, a seduction scene in a hayloft where she makes a pass at the bus driver (Rick Jason), \\"manages to steal the sexiest scene in the picture,\\" over better known actresses Jayne Mansfield and Joan Collins and wrote Hollywood had not had a scene like it since Jane Russell in The Outlaw. Director Victor Vicas shot two versions, an \\"A\\" scene and a \\"B\\" scene, because of the censors. Award nominations The Wayward Bus was one of 33 films nominated for the Golden Berlin Bear Award at the 7th Berlin International Film Festival.

Biography Meredith was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas, and moved to Hollywood in the mid-1920s after winning a beauty contest that brought her to the attention of talent scouts. She was pretty, with a petite build and was 5 feet tall. Her first credited role was in the 1925 film Blue Blood, starring alongside George Walsh and Cecille Evans. She starred in two films that year, and was one of thirteen girls selected to be \\"WAMPAS Baby Stars\\", a list which included June Marlowe, now famous for her role on the Our Gang serials. Her second film of 1925 was opposite Dorothy Dwan in The Perfect Clown. In 1926 she would star in four films, the first of which would place her alongside George Walsh once again, this time in The Count of Luxembourg. Her second film that year was The Fighting Boob, followed by a western placing her in the role of heroine opposite early cowboy film star Bill Cody. However, her career never really took off as hoped, and she would leave acting behind after only six films. Her last film of her short-lived career was her best remembered, due to it helping to launch the career of Mae Busch, titled The Truthful Sex, and which also starred Huntley Gordon. Meredith left acting following that film, working for a time as a model, eventually settling in Los Angeles, where she resided until her death on October 13, 1980.

Den Nationale Scene is also one of the oldest permanent theatres in Norway. History Den Nationale Scene at night Opened under the name Det Norske Theater in 1850, the theatre has roots dating back to its founding on the initiative of the Norwegian violinist Ole Bull. The theatre was created to develop Norwegian playwrights. Henrik Ibsen was one of the first writers-in-residences and art-directors of the theatreHenrik Ibsen/utdypning (Store norske leksikon) and it saw the premi√®re in Norway of his first contemporary realist drama The Pillars of Society (Samfundets st√∏tter) on 30 November 1877. The theatre was initially housed in the Komediehuset p√• Engen. In 1909, The National Theatre moved into the new theatre building at Engen. The current theatre building was designed by Einar Oscar Schou, and opened 19 February 1909 with a production of Erasmus Montanus by Ludvig Holberg. King Haakon VII of Norway and Queen Maud were in attendance. It soon became apparent that the building was too small. In 1913 the company bought Ekserserhuset Jonsvoll to use as a warehouse. In 1920, an extension was built to the northwest. Over the years the building has undergone major changes, extensions, renovation, restoration and stage technical modernisation. The foyer and the hall were destroyed during the Second World War, and only temporarily restored.Den Nationale Scene (Store norske leksikon) The theatre experienced a pre-war high point during the period 1934-39 under the leadership Hans Jacob Nilsen. Especially noteworthy was the 1935 premiere of the play V√•r √¶re og v√•r makt (\\"Our Honor and our Power\\") by Nordahl Grieg. In 2001 the building was restored almost to its original shape. Today the theatre houses three stages/venues and presents approximately 20 productions each year, both international and national classics, musicals and contemporary drama, as well as children's theatre. Since 1993, the theatre has been state property.

Markov's principle says that if it is impossible that a Turing machine will not halt, then it must halt. Markov's principle, named after Andrey Markov Jr, is a conditional existence statement for which there are many equivalent formulations, as discussed below. The principle is logical validity classically, but not in intuitionistic constructive mathematics. However, many particular instances of it are nevertheless provable in a constructive context as well.  History  The principle was first studied and adopted by the Russian school of constructivism, together with choice principles and often with a realizability perspective on the notion of mathematical function. In computability theory In the language of computability theory, Markov's principle is a formal expression of the claim that if it is impossible that an algorithm does not terminate, then it does terminate. This is equivalent to the claim that if a set and its complement are both computably enumerable, then the set is decidable. In Intuitionistic logic In predicate logic, a predicate P over some domain is called decidable if for every x in the domain, either P(x) is true, or P(x) is not true. This is not trivially true constructively. For a decidable predicate P over the natural numbers, Markov's principle then reads: :(\\\\forall n (P(n) \\\\vee eg P(n)) \\\\wedge eg \\\\forall n\\\\, eg P(n)) \\\\rightarrow \\\\exists n\\\\, P(n) That is, if P cannot be false for all natural numbers n, then it is true for some n. =Markov's rule= Markov's rule is the formulation of Markov's principle as a rule. It states that \\\\exists n\\\\;P(n) is derivable as soon as eg eg \\\\exists n\\\\;P(n) is, for P decidable. Formally, :\\\\forall n (P(n)\\\\lor eg P(n)),\\\\ eg eg \\\\exists n\\\\;P(n)\\\\ \\\\vdash\\\\ \\\\exists n\\\\;P(n) Anne S. TroelstraAnne S. Troelstra. Metamathematical Investigation of Intuitionistic Arithmetic and Analysis, Springer Verlag (1973), Theorem 4.2.4 of the 2nd edition. proves that it is an admissible rule in Heyting arithmetic. Later, the logician Harvey Friedman showed that Markov's rule is an admissible rule in all of intuitionistic logic, Heyting arithmetic, and various other intuitionistic theories,Harvey Friedman. Classically and Intuitionistically Provably Recursive Functions. In Scott, D. S. and Muller, G. H. Editors, Higher Set Theory, Volume 699 of Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Springer Verlag (1978), pp. 21‚Äì28. using the Friedman translation. In Heyting arithmetic It is equivalent in the language of arithmetic to: : eg eg \\\\exists n\\\\;f(n)=0 \\\\rightarrow \\\\exists n\\\\;f(n)=0, for f a total recursive function on the natural numbers. =Realizability= If constructive arithmetic is translated using realizability into a classical meta-theory that proves the \\\\omega-consistency of the relevant classical theory (for example, Peano Arithmetic if we are studying Heyting arithmetic), then Markov's principle is justified: a realizer is the constant function that takes a realization that P is not everywhere false to the unbounded search that successively checks if P(0), P(1), P(2),\\\\dots is true. If P is not everywhere false, then by \\\\omega-consistency there must be a term for which P holds, and each term will be checked by the search eventually. If however P does not hold anywhere, then the domain of the constant function must be empty, so although the search does not halt it still holds vacuously that the function is a realizer. By the Law of the Excluded Middle (in our classical metatheory), P must either hold nowhere or not hold nowhere, therefore this constant function is a realizer. If instead the realizability interpretation is used in a constructive meta-theory, then it is not justified. Indeed, for first-order arithmetic, Markov's principle exactly captures the difference between a constructive and classical meta-theory. Specifically, a statement is provable in Heyting arithmetic with Extended Church's thesis if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in Heyting arithmetic; and it is provable in Heyting arithmetic with Extended Church's thesis and Markov's principle if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in Peano arithmetic. In constructive analysis It is equivalent, in the language of real analysis, to the following principles: * For each real number x, if it is contradictory that x is equal to 0, then there exists y ‚àà Q such that 0 < y < x, often expressed by saying that x is apart from, or constructively unequal to, 0\\\\. * For each real number x, if it is contradictory that x is equal to 0, then there exists y ‚àà R such that xy = 1\\\\. Modified realizability does not justify Markov's principle, even if classical logic is used in the meta- theory: there is no realizer in the language of simply typed lambda calculus as this language is not Turing-complete and arbitrary loops cannot be defined in it. =Weak Markov's principle= The Weak Markov's principle is a weaker form of Markov's principle may be stated in the language of analysis as : \\\\forall x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\ \\\\ (\\\\forall y\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\ \\\\ eg eg(0 It is a conditional statement about the decidability of positivity of a real number. This form can be justified by Brouwer's continuity principles, whereas the stronger form contradicts them. Thus it can be derived from intuitionistic, realizability, and classical reasoning, in each case for different reasons, but this principle is not valid in the general constructive sense of Bishop.Ulrich Kohlenbach, \\"On weak Markov's principle\\".

It was first announced and confirmed as an integrated travel card, comparable to London's Oyster card, for Greater Manchester in June 2012, following a bid from the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. History Get me there is based upon trials of the Bolton Citizen Card smartcard that was issued to residents of the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton in 2007 as a pilot. It is valid on travel modes across Greater Manchester including buses, Metrolink and most National Rail services within the jurisdiction of TfGM. Use People in Greater Manchester with existing concessionary travel passes were invited to test the scheme. Now, all concessionary pass holders are asked to start touching in and out when traveling using Metrolink. Season ticket holders were the first to be offered their own 'my get me there' card, and now all others can sign up for a card. Customers can use contactless credit/debit card with readers for simple journeys on Get Me There. However, they will not be able to store season tickets or take advantage of automatic cheapest fare functionality available to smart card users. The name get me there was revealed on 17 June 2013, with the scheme's dedicated travel card named my get me there. Timescale GMT was planned to be introduced on Metrolink services from 2014, Greater Manchester bus services from 2015, and was hoped to be introduced on National Rail services across Greater Manchester from 2017, when the new Northern rail franchise was confirmed. However, the scheme's introduction on Metrolink stalled after the first stage, as it became clear that Atos, who were contracted to deliver and operate the scheme, would not be able to manage the rollout on to trams. The contract was cancelled in August 2015, with significant contractual payments made to TfGM. Plans for introducing mobile phone-based ticketing on trams before the end of the year were announced in September 2015 along with continuing rollout of the GMT card on buses via System One, the Northern and TransPennine Express rail franchises remain contractually obliged to roll out smart card use on trains as part of their franchise requirements and the northern PTEs as Rail North are doing preparatory work on a region wide smartcard.  Reception  The GMT system has been criticised in the press as confusing and less flexible than London's Oyster card. Particular points of criticism include the requirement to buy Metrolink tickets for specific times, a long delay between purchasing a ticket online and the ticket becoming usable, and a lack of clarity regarding the distinction between the smartcard and the accompanying app, which are two independent systems.

In languages that have the serial verb construction, coverbs are a type of word that shares features of verbs and prepositions. A coverb takes an object or complement and forms a phrase that appears in sequence with another verb phrase in accordance with the serial construction. A coverb appears to be subordinate to a main verb and fulfills a function similar to that of a preposition. Some words that may be classed as coverbs can also function as independent verbs, but that is not always the case. Coverbs in that sense are found in Asian languages such as Chinese and Vietnamese,Ho-Dac Tuc, Vietnamese-English Bilingualism: Patterns of Code-Switching, Routledge 2014, p. 68. and, for example, West African languages such as Yoruba. are given below. The term coverb (like preverb) is also sometimes used to denote the first element in a compound verb or complex predicate. There, the coverb supplies significant semantic information, and the second element (a light verb) is inflected to convey mainly grammatical information. The term is used in this way in relation to, for instance, North Australian languages.Mengistu Amberber, Brett Baker, Mark Harvey, Complex Predicates: Cross-linguistic Perspectives on Event Structure, CUP 2010, p. 59. In relation to Hungarian, coverb is sometimes used to denote a verb prefix.Carol H. Rounds, Hungarian: An Essential Grammar, Routledge 2013, p. 74ff. They are elements that express meanings such as direction or completion and so have a function corresponding to that of certain types of adverbs. Examples The following examples demonstrate the usage of coverbs in Standard Chinese. They illustrate the first‚Äîprobably most common‚Äîof the three above meanings for the term. : : '''' : I help you find him : \\"I'm finding him for you.\\" The above sentence represents a typical Chinese serial verb construction, with two consecutive verb phrases meaning \\"help you\\" and \\"find him\\", sharing the same subject (\\"I\\"), and essentially referring to the same action. The meaning of the \\"help you\\" phrase, however, is closer in this context to the English prepositional phrase \\"for you\\". Thus, the word bƒÅng, while it may be analyzed as a verb meaning \\"help\\", actually has a function closer to that of a preposition meaning \\"for\\". It is words like bƒÅng, as used in the above sentence, that are referred to as coverbs in descriptions of Chinese (and of other languages, like Vietnamese and Yoruba, which have analogous structures). : : w«í zu√≤ fƒìijƒ´ c√≥ng Sh√†ngh«éi d√†o Bƒõijƒ´ng q√π : I sit aircraft follow Shanghai arrive Beijing go : \\"I travel from Shanghai to Beijing by aircraft.\\" In the above example, there are three coverbs: zu√≤ (here having the prepositional meaning \\"by (a transportation medium)\\"), c√≥ng (meaning \\"from\\"), and d√†o (here meaning \\"to\\"), with Âéª q√π (\\"to go\\") at the end as the main verb. The three coverbs are also used as main verbs in other contexts, namely as \\"sit\\", \\"follow\\" and \\"arrive\\" respectively. Not all Chinese coverbs can be used as main verbs, however, especially disyllabic ones such as Ê†πÊçÆ gƒìnj√π (\\"according to\\"), which on the other hand can be a noun meaning \\"the basis, foundation (of something said)\\". One important aspect about Chinese coverbs is the use of temporal order, so e.g. coverbs expressing the source of movement must appear before the coverb expressing the destination in the clause. Since coverbs precede their complement (object) and perform essentially a prepositional function, some linguists simply refer to them as prepositions. In Chinese, they are called ji√®c√≠ (), a term which generally corresponds to \\"preposition\\" (or more generally, \\"adposition\\"). The situation is complicated somewhat by the fact that Chinese has location markers that appear after a noun that are often called postpositions. The meaning of an English locational preposition is often, but not always, conveyed by a coverb and a location marker in combination, as in z√†i zhu≈çzi sh√†ng, meaning \\"on the table\\" but literally \\"be.at table on\\".

The HVM carried no warhead and killed its targets with kinetic energy alone using a metal rod penetrator. Development as an air- launched weapon for the A-10 Thunderbolt II ended sometime in the late 1980s but continued for helicopter use into the 1990s along with ground-launched (HMMWV) as the larger MGM-166 LOSAT. None of these systems was operationally deployed. The HVM was intended as a fairly inexpensive weapon, compared to the AGM-65 Maverick at least, offering the standoff performance while requiring a minimum of support electronics. The target was acquired using a FLIR system on the launch vehicle, and after launch the missile quickly accelerated to 1500 m/s (5,000 ft/s, 5,400 km/h, Mach 4.3) and into the view of the FLIR, which tracked both the target and missile from that point on. Corrections to the flight path were sent to the missile via a laser, and the missile included the electronics needed to guide itself back to the correct flight path. The missile was just under 3 meters long and about 10 cm in diameter. The aft portion was flared out in a cone, which gives it some directional stability without requiring fold-out fins. Most of the stabilization was due to spin. Directional control was accomplished via thrust vectoring. The penetrator was housed under an ogive nose cone. The contract was initially sent to Vought Missiles and Space in late 1981, and the first unpowered drop tests were carried out in March 1983. A contract for joint development by the US Air Force, US Army and US Marine Corps followed in October 1984, but the Air Force dropped out of the program sometime in the late 1980s (Janes' says '87-'89). In 1988, Texas Instruments and Vought teamed up to enter a modified version of the HVM into the Army's new Advanced Anti-Tank Weapon System ‚Äì Heavy (AAWS-H) competition, winning it as the MGM-166 LOSAT (or KEM, Kinetic Energy Missile) with a slightly enlarged and finned version of the basic HVM system.

History On 14 April 1634, shortly after the Unicorn was launched, her first captain, Sir John Penington, was knighted on her deck by King Charles I. On 8 May 1634 aboard the Unicorn in The Downs, Sir John in a letter to the Admiralty (State Papers, Charles I, 1‚Äì15 May 1634) wrote that the Unicorn was \\"tender sided\\" and \\"walty\\" and in her current state \\"could hold no sail\\" and as such, was not serviceable. He further states that this opinion was also held by all of his officers, as well as the builder Mr. Boate, who was also aboard. In defence of the builder, he says in all other respects the Unicorn handles \\"as well as any other ship he has put his foot in\\" and she \\"only wants two or three more foot of breadth\\".

Her first role was in the 1925 film Excuse Me, which was uncredited. Her first credited role was that same year in Don't, which starred Sally O'Neil.

She continued to act through 1935 after the end of her MGM contract, but only had one credited role out of six films during that period. She married actor Robert (Tex) Allen, and although he continued to act well into the 1980s, Peirce retired from acting. They had one daughter, Katherine Meyer, and a son, Ted Baehr, who chose to go by his father's birth name, and who is a well known media critic, as well as chairman of \\"The Christian Film and Television Commission\\", and publisher of MOVIEGUIDE.

He was born in Ynyscynhaearn, Caernarvonshire, the son of a Congregational minister. He was educated at Porthmadog Grammar School and Grove Park School, Wrexham, going on to study medicine at University of Wales, Bangor, and St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Becoming a specialist in the treatment of mental illness, he worked as a junior medical officer at the Royal Earlswood Institution and Colney Hatch during the 1880s, and became resident physician and superintendent of Earlswood Asylum in 1888. In 1893 he became the first superintendent of the London County Council's Claybury Asylum, where he developed new treatments. In the same year he married Margaret Roberts (1868‚Äì1943), the elder daughter of Sir Owen Roberts of Plas Dinas, Caernarfon. Armstrong-Jones lectured at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and became consulting physician in mental diseases to the military forces at London and Aldershot. In 1913, he assumed the additional surname of Armstrong, which had been the maiden name of his wife's mother, Jane Armstrong Roberts, because he wanted to distinguish himself from another prominent Robert Jones of the time. During World War I, he was designated a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps; he was knighted in the 1917 New Year Honours, and after the war he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in recognition of his war service. He was appointed High Sheriff of Caernarvonshire for 1929. He was a Fellow of both the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons. Armstrong-Jones had one son, Ronald Armstrong-Jones, and two daughters, Elaine Margaret Wauchope (1895‚Äì1965) and Gwendolen Jane Buckley (1905‚Äì1985), who married Sir Denys Buckley. Armstrong-Jones died in Plas Dinas at the age of 85. His wife survived him by only four months. Their daughter Elaine married Colonel Charles Wauchup. Armstrong-Jones's son, Ronald, became a barrister, married Anne Messel (firstly) and was the father of Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, the brother-in-law of Queen Elizabeth II.

Family Susanne Linke was born in L√ºneburg, Germany, to Heinz Linke (a pastor) and Rosi Linke-Sch√§fer (born Peschko). A hearing and speech disorder and related issues delayed the development of her speaking ability as a child. The German pianist Sebastian Peschko is her uncle. Career Susanne Linke only began to study dance at the age of twenty, when she went to Berlin to take lessons from Mary Wigman at her studio. Three years later she moved to Essen to pursue dance at the Folkwang Hochschule (Folkwang Academy) founded by Kurt Jooss. In 1970, she became a dancer in the school's dance company, the Folkwang Tanzstudio (Folkwang Dance Studio), then under the direction of Pina Bausch. During the period from 1970 to 1973, she also danced with the Rotterdam Dance Center. In 1975, Linke and Reinhild Hoffmann together took over leadership of the Folkwang Tanzstudio from Bausch, a position Linke continued to hold for a decade. Susanne Linke has choreographed original dance works since 1970, becoming known for a style that is intense, austere, and neoexpressionist. Two of her 1975 dances‚ÄîDanse fun√®bre (Funeral Dance) and Trop Trad (Too Trad)‚Äî were awarded prizes. Other works from the 1970s and 1980s include Puppe? (Doll?, 1975), Die N√§chste bitte (Next Please, 1978), Im Bade wannen (Bath Tubbing, 1980), Wowerwiewas (1980), Flut (Flood, 1981), Frauenballett (Women's Ballet, 1981), Es schwant (It Continues, 1982), and Wir k√∂nnen nicht alle nur Schw√§ne sein (We Can't All Only Be Swans, 1982). Her first full-evening work was based on the Bacchae of Euripides. Schritte verfolgen (Follow the Steps, 1985), Linke's first major solo ballet, dealt with her problematic childhood and the development of a dancer. Since the 1980s, Linke has participated in the major international dance festivals, often dancing her own solos. Her international solo career has been significantly supported by the Goethe- Institut. In 1985, she resigned from the management of the Folkwang Dance Studio and began to work primarily as a freelance choreographer, making work for such well-known groups as the Jos√© Lim√≥n Company in New York, the Paris Opera, and the Nederlands Dans Theater. In 1987, Linke showed her own version of four solo choreographies reconstructed from films of Dore Hoyer's 1962 Afectos Humanos (Human Affects) cycle dedicated to the themes of vanity, lust, fear, and love. She added a fifth segment, Dolor (Sorrow) as a confrontation with Hoyer's work and an homage to Hoyer, whom Linke greatly admired and had met during her student days in Essen. She followed this up with two further works, the duets Affekte (Affects, 1988) und Affekte/Gelb' (Affects/Yellow, 1990), that extended the basic themes of Afectos Humanos through a relationship between two people. Linke danced these with her partner Urs Dietrich. In the early 1990s, she founded the Susanne Linke Company at the Hebbel Theater in Berlin. Then, in 1994, she co-founded (with Urs Dietrich) a new dance company at the Bremer Theater in Bremen and continued to direct this company until 2000. In 2000-01, she co-founded a new choreographic center in Essen, the Choreographisches Zentrum Essen, and became its artistic director. Since 2001, she has worked frequently as a freelance choreographer and dancer. Awards In 2007, the German Professional Association for Dance Education gave Linke the prestigious German Dance Prize in honor of her life's work in dance. In 2008, she was appointed to the French Order of Arts and Letters. Since 2010, she has been an honorary professor at the Folkwang University of the Arts in Essen. Further reading *Schmidt, Jochen.

The book was first published on April 1, 1993 by Beacon Press. The book analyzes moral authority and racial debates concerning skin color in the United States. The book questions matters of economics and politics, as well as ethical issues and spirituality, and also addresses the crisis in black American leadership. Summary The book consists of an introduction, followed by eight essays, many of which previously appeared in other publications, such as The New York Times Magazine, Dissent and Z Magazine. In order, these essays are: *1. Nihilism in Black America *2. The Pitfalls of Racial Reasoning *3. The Crisis of Black Leadership *4. Demystifying the New Black Conservatism *5. Beyond Affirmative Action: Equality and Identity *6. On Black-Jewish Relations *7. Black Sexuality: The Taboo Subject *8. Malcolm X and Black Rage Reception Michiko Kakutani praised Race Matters, writing in The New York Times 'one can only applaud the ferocious moral vision and astute intellect on display in these pages', though she criticized his proposed solutions to racial problems as 'vague and sentimentally utopian'. A positive review in The Washington Post said 'there are parts of this book that are as moving as any of the sermons of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., as profound as W.E.B. Du Bois's The Souls of Black Folk, as exhilarating in their offering of liberation as James Baldwin's early essays'. 'Race Matters' received a negative review in Commentary which stated that 'despite the artful packaging, West‚Äôs ultimate message is neither new nor courageous' and singled out the chapter on the relationship between black people and Jews as 'deeply flawed, evasive, and less than honest'. Race Matters received a positive review in Publishers Weekly, which called the book 'powerful' and said that the essays 'solidify [West's] position as one of the nation's leading public intellectuals' 'Race Matters' was positively received by Kirkus Reviews, which praised West's 'clear thinking and sensible analysis' though stated that, in aiming for a broad audience 'West perhaps too much curtails his customary intellectual range'.

It is often seen as one of the reasons for the \\"revolution\\" of the 1977 elections. Background In 1976, HaOlam HaZeh began publishing investigations regarding illegitimate financial transactions concerning senior members of the labor movement and the party funds. The names mentioned included Asher Yadlin, who was about to be appointed Governor of the Bank of Israel. Yadlin was known to be a gambling buff (favoring the Las Vegas roulette table) with an eye for pretty women, He was also a major fund raiser for the Labor Party; since 1973, he had headed Israel's huge Kupat Holim health-insurance program. The reports also mentioned Avraham Ofer, Yitzhak Rabin's Minister of Housing. The investigations suggested bribery, and the reporter Yigal Laviv pressed charges. Scandal The cabinet decided, on September 5, to appoint Yadlin, former head of the Histadrut's economic enterprises, governor of the Bank of Israel to succeed Moshe Sanbar on November 1. On the day after the cabinet decision, Police Minister Shlomo Hillel and Attorney-General Aharon Barak were informed that the police had been inquiring into allegations against Yadlin of improper conduct in the management of Kupat Holim. Yadlin declared that the allegations were without basis and that he would welcome an investigation. After a month of intensive police investigation, Yadlin was detained for interrogation on suspicion of having accepted bribes and undercover commissions in transactions affecting Kupat Holim. On October 24 the cabinet resolved, without prejudging the charges against Yadlin, that it could no longer delay the appointment, and named Director-General of the Treasury Arnon Gafni as governor of the Bank of Israel. There was considerable criticism of the daily publicity by the press to unproven rumors of charges against Yadlin, which were believed to have been fed by unauthorized disclosures from police sources. In mid-December Yadlin was charged with taking bribes totaling I¬£ 280,000, as well as other offenses, and was remanded in custody until his trial. On March 14, 1977, Yadlin pleaded guilty to some of the charges, involving bribes totaling I¬£124,000, but claimed that he had handed over I¬£80,000 of the money to Labor party funds, adding that he had raised \\"millions\\" for the party. The judge did not accept his claim and sentenced him to five years' imprisonment and a fine of I¬£250,000. Further charges were to be investigated by the police after consideration of Yadlin's appeal. Aftermath Towards the upcoming elections, Shimon Peres and his supporters had jumped on the Yadlin scandal as proof of Rabin's poor judgment in making appointments. For the left, it showed that the Labor Party had lost track of its ideological socialist roots. For the Israeli right, it was evidence of the Labor Party's corruptibility. It is widely regarded as one of the main causes of the Labor party's downfall in the elections. Yadlin was released from prison in 1981 and subsequently emigrated to the United States. Talia Livni, Yadlin's common law wife, was a lawyer who assisted him in legal matters. She married him while he was in jail, but divorced him after he emigrated. Dalia, Yadlin's ex-wife, supported him and tried to present him as a pawn in the party's hands and as a victim of its \\"method\\". Ofer, whose name was associated with the Yadlin affair as well as another one, committed suicide on January 3, 1977. Barak was seen as a relentless fighter against corruption. He was later appointed to the Supreme Court of Israel. Some argue that his role in the Yadlin affair helped him carry out his famous judicial activist positions. The \\"Yadlin House\\", a building in north Tel Aviv, whose construction was linked to the bribe money, remained unfinished. In 2005 it was sold and has since been demolished.

At various points some or all of these eleven unsolved murders of women have been ascribed to the notorious unidentified serial killer known as Jack the Ripper. Most, if not all, of the victims‚ÄîEmma Elizabeth Smith, Martha Tabram, Mary Ann \\"Polly\\" Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, Mary Jane Kelly, Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, Frances Coles, and an unidentified woman‚Äîwere prostitutes. Smith was sexually assaulted and robbed by a gang. Tabram was stabbed 39 times. Nichols, Chapman, Stride, Eddowes, Kelly, McKenzie and Coles had their throats cut. Eddowes and Stride were murdered on the same night, within approximately an hour and less than a mile apart; their murders are known as the \\"double event\\", after a phrase in a postcard sent to the press by an individual claiming to be the Ripper. The bodies of Nichols, Chapman, Eddowes and Kelly had abdominal mutilations. Mylett was strangled. The body of the unidentified woman was dismembered, but the exact cause of her death is unclear. The Metropolitan Police, City of London Police, and private organisations such as the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee were actively involved in the search for the perpetrator or perpetrators. Despite extensive enquiries and several arrests, the culprit or culprits evaded capture, and the murders were never solved. The Whitechapel murders drew attention to the poor living conditions in the East End slums, which were subsequently improved. The enduring mystery of who committed the crimes has captured public imagination to the present day. Background Dorset Street, Spitalfields, seen here in 1902 In the late Victorian era, Whitechapel was considered to be the most notorious criminal rookery in London. The area around Flower and Dean Street was described as \\"perhaps the foulest and most dangerous street in the whole metropolis\\";Greenwood, James (1883), In Strange Company, London, p. 158, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, pp. 21, 45 Dorset Street was called \\"the worst street in London\\".Daily Mail, 16 July 1901, quoted in Werner (ed.), pp. 62, 179 Assistant Police Commissioner Robert Anderson recommended Whitechapel to \\"those who take an interest in the dangerous classes\\" as one of London's prime criminal \\"show places\\".Pall Mall Gazette, 4 November 1889, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 225 and Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 516 Robbery, violence and alcohol dependency were commonplace. The district was characterised by extreme poverty, sub-standard housing, poor sanitation, homelessness, drunkenness and endemic prostitution. These factors were focused in the institution of the 233 common lodging-houses within Whitechapel, in which approximately 8,500 people resided on a nightly basis.Honeycombe, The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970, p. 54 The common lodging-houses in and around Whitechapel provided cheap communal lodgings for the desperate, the destitute and the transient, among whom the Whitechapel murder victims were numbered.Werner (ed.), pp. 42‚Äì44, 118‚Äì122, 141‚Äì170 The nightly price of a single bed was 4d,Rumbelow, Complete Jack The Ripper p. 14 and the cost of sleeping upon a \\"lean-to\\" rope stretched across the bedrooms was 2d for adults or children.Rumbelow, Jack the Ripper: The Complete Casebook p. 30 All the identified victims of the Whitechapel murders lived within the heart of the rookery in Spitalfields, including three in George Street (later named Lolesworth Street), two in Dorset Street, two in Flower and Dean Street and one in Thrawl Street.White, Jerry (2007), London in the Nineteenth Century, London: Jonathan Cape, , pp. 323‚Äì332 Police work and criminal prosecutions at the time relied heavily on confessions, witness testimony, and apprehending perpetrators in the act of committing an offence or in the possession of obvious physical evidence that clearly linked them to a crime. Forensic techniques, such as fingerprint analysis, were not in use,Marriott, p. 207 and blood typing had not been invented.Lloyd, pp. 51‚Äì52 Policing in London was‚Äîand still is‚Äîdivided between two forces: the Metropolitan Police with jurisdiction over most of the urban area, and the City of London Police with jurisdiction over about a square mile (2.9 km2) of the city centre. The Home Secretary, a senior minister of the British government, controlled the Metropolitan Police, whereas the City Police were responsible to the Corporation of London. Beat constables walked regular, timed routes.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 14 Eleven deaths in or near Whitechapel between 1888 and 1891 were gathered into a single file, referred to in the police docket as the Whitechapel murders.\\"The Enduring Mystery of Jack the Ripper\\" , Metropolitan Police, retrieved 1 May 2009Cook, pp. 33‚Äì34; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 3 Much of the original material has been either stolen, lost, or destroyed. Victims and investigation Map of the Spitalfields rookery, where the victims lived. Emma Elizabeth Smith was attacked near the junction of Osborn Street and Brick Lane (red circle). She lived in a common lodging-house at 18 George Street (later named Lolesworth Street), one block west of where she was attacked.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 47; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 4; Fido, p. 15; Rumbelow, p. 30 =Emma Elizabeth Smith= On Tuesday 3 April 1888, following the Easter Monday bank holiday, 45-year-old prostitute Emma Elizabeth Smith was assaulted and robbed at the junction of Osborn Street and Brick Lane, Whitechapel, in the early hours of the morning. Although injured, she survived the attack and managed to walk back to her lodging house at 18 George Street, Spitalfields. She told the deputy keeper, Mary Russell, that she had been attacked by two or three men, one of them a teenager. Mrs Russell took Smith to the London Hospital, where a medical examination revealed that a blunt object had been inserted into her vagina, rupturing her peritoneum. She developed peritonitis and died at 9 am the following day.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, pp. 27‚Äì29; Cook, pp. 34‚Äì35; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 47‚Äì50; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 4‚Äì7 The inquest was conducted on 7 April by the coroner for East Middlesex, Wynne Edwin Baxter, who also conducted inquests on six of the later victims.Whitehead and Rivett, p. 18 The local inspector of the Metropolitan Police, Edmund Reid of H Division Whitechapel, investigated the attack but the culprits were never caught.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 47‚Äì50 Walter Dew, a detective constable stationed with H Division, later wrote that he thought Smith was the first victim of Jack the Ripper,Dew, Walter (1938), I Caught Crippen, London: Blackie and Son, p. 92, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 29 but his colleagues suspected it was the work of a criminal gang.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 29 Smith claimed that she was attacked by a group of men, but either refused to or could not describe them. East End prostitutes were often managed by gangs, and Smith could have been attacked by her pimps as a punishment for disobeying them, or as an act of intimidation.Marriott, pp. 5‚Äì7 She may not have identified her attackers because she feared reprisal. Her murder is considered unlikely to be connected with the later killings.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, pp. 29‚Äì31; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 47‚Äì50; Marriott, pp. 5‚Äì7 =Martha Tabram= Martha Tabram, 39, lived in a lodging-house at 19 George Street.Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 11; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 19 On Tuesday 7 August, following a Monday bank holiday, prostitute Martha Tabram was murdered at about 2:30 am. Her body was found at George Yard Buildings, George Yard, Whitechapel. She had been stabbed 39 times with a short blade. On the basis of statements from a fellow prostitute, and PC Thomas Barrett who was patrolling nearby, Inspector Reid put soldiers at the Tower of London and Wellington Barracks on an identification parade, but without positive results.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, pp. 51‚Äì53; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 51‚Äì55; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 8‚Äì18; Marriott, pp. 9‚Äì14 Police did not connect Tabram's murder with the murder of Emma Smith, but they did connect her death with later murders.In an interview reported in the Pall Mall Gazette, 24 March 1903, Inspector Frederick Abberline referred to \\"George-yard, Whitechapel-road, where the first murder was committed\\" (quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 56). Walter Dew wrote in his memoirs, that \\"there can be no doubt that the August Bank Holiday murder ... was the handiwork of the Ripper\\" (I Caught Crippen, p. 97, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 56). In his memoirs, Assistant Commissioner Robert Anderson said the second murder occurred on 31 August (quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 632). Most experts do not connect Tabram's murder with the others attributed to the Ripper, because she was repeatedly stabbed whereas later victims typically suffered slash wounds and abdominal mutilations. However, a connection cannot be ruled out.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 515; Marriott, p. 13 =Mary Ann Nichols= Mary Ann Nichols, 43, lived in a lodging-house at 18 Thrawl Street.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, pp. 85‚Äì85; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 61; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 24 Inspector Frederick Abberline led the police investigation. On Friday 31 August, Mary Ann Nichols was murdered in Buck's Row (since renamed Durward Street), a back street in Whitechapel. Her body was discovered by cart driver Charles Cross at 3:45 am on the ground in front of a gated stable entrance. Her throat had been slit twice from left to right and her abdomen was mutilated by a deep jagged wound. Several shallower incisions across the abdomen, and three or four similar cuts on the right side were caused by the same knife used violently and downwards.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 60‚Äì61; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 35; Rumbelow, pp. 24‚Äì27 As the murder occurred in the territory of the J or Bethnal Green Division of the Metropolitan Police, it was at first investigated by the local detectives. On the same day, James Monro resigned as the head of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) over differences with Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Charles Warren.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 64 Initial investigations into the murder had little success, although elements of the press linked it to the two previous murders and suggested the killing might have been perpetrated by a gang, as in the case of Smith.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 98; Cook, pp. 25‚Äì28; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 62‚Äì63 The Star newspaper suggested instead that a single killer was responsible and other newspapers took up their storyline.Cook, pp. 25‚Äì28; Woods and Baddeley, pp. 21‚Äì22 Suspicions of a serial killer at large in London led to the secondment of Detective Inspectors Frederick Abberline, Henry Moore and Walter Andrews from the Central Office at Scotland Yard.Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 676, 678 On the available evidence, Coroner Baxter concluded that Nichols was murdered at just after 3 am where she was found. In his summing up, he dismissed the possibility that her murder was connected with those of Smith and Tabram, as the lethal weapons were different in those cases, and neither of the earlier cases involved a slash to the throat.Marriott, pp. 21‚Äì22 However, by the time the inquest into Nichols's death had concluded, a fourth woman had been murdered, and Baxter noted \\"The similarity of the injuries in the two cases is considerable.\\"Marriott, pp. 22‚Äì23 =Annie Chapman= Annie Chapman, 47, lived in a lodging-house at 35 Dorset Street.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 66‚Äì73; Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 33‚Äì34 The mutilated body of the fourth woman, Annie Chapman, was discovered at about 6:00 am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway in the back yard of 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields. Chapman had left her lodgings at 2 am on the day she was murdered, with the intention of getting money from a client to pay her rent.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 66‚Äì70 Her throat was cut from left to right. She had been disembowelled, and her intestines had been thrown out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. The pathologist, George Bagster Phillips, was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6‚Äì8 inches (15‚Äì20 cm) long.Cook, p. 221; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 71‚Äì72; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 67‚Äì68, 87; Marriott, pp. 26‚Äì29; Rumbelow, p. 42 However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts.Fido, p. 35; Marriott, pp. 77‚Äì79 As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens.Marriott, pp. 77‚Äì79 On 10 September, the police arrested a notorious local called John Pizer, dubbed \\"Leather Apron\\", who had a reputation for terrorising local prostitutes. His alibis for the two most recent murders were corroborated, and he was released without charge.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 157; Cook, pp. 65‚Äì66; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 29; Marriott, pp. 59‚Äì75; Rumbelow, pp. 49‚Äì50 At the inquest one of the witnesses, Mrs Elizabeth Long, testified that she had seen Chapman talking to a man at about 5:30 am just beyond the back yard of 29 Hanbury Street, where Chapman was later found. Baxter inferred that the man Mrs Long had seen was the murderer. Mrs Long described him as over forty, a little taller than Chapman, of dark complexion, and of foreign, \\"shabby-genteel\\" appearance. He was wearing a brown deer-stalker hat and a dark overcoat.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 153; Cook, p. 163; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 98; Marriott, pp. 59‚Äì75 Another witness, carpenter Albert Cadosch, had entered the neighbouring yard at 27 Hanbury Street at about the same time, and heard voices in the yard followed by the sound of something falling against the fence.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 153; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 100; Marriott, pp. 59‚Äì75 George Lusk, President of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee In his memoirs, Walter Dew recorded that the killings caused widespread panic in London.Connell, pp. 15‚Äì16; Cook, p. 90 A mob attacked the Commercial Road police station, suspecting that the murderer was being held there.Connell, pp. 19‚Äì21; Rumbelow, pp. 67‚Äì68 Samuel Montagu, the Member of Parliament for Whitechapel, offered a reward of ¬£100 (roughly ¬£ as of ) after rumours that the attacks were Jewish ritual killings led to anti-Semitic demonstrations.Davenport-Hines Local residents founded the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee under the chairmanship of George Lusk and offered a reward for the apprehension of the killer‚Äîsomething the Metropolitan Police (under instruction from the Home Office) refused to do because it could lead to false or misleading information.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 159‚Äì160; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 111‚Äì119, 265‚Äì290 The Committee employed two private detectives to investigate the case.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 186 Robert Anderson was appointed head of the CID on 1 September, but he went on sick leave to Switzerland on the 7th. Superintendent Thomas Arnold, who was in charge of H (Whitechapel) Division, went on leave on 2 September.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 65 Anderson's absence left overall direction of the enquiries confused, and led Chief Commissioner Sir Charles Warren to appoint Chief Inspector Donald Swanson to co-ordinate the investigation from Scotland Yard.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 205; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 84‚Äì85 A German hairdresser named Charles Ludwig was taken into custody on 18 September on suspicion of the murders, but he was released less than two weeks later when a double murder demonstrated that the real culprit was still at large.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 86 =Double event: Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes= Elizabeth Stride, 44, lived in a lodging-house at 32 Flower and Dean Street.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, pp. 46, 168‚Äì170; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 96‚Äì98; Rumbelow, pp. 69‚Äì70 On Sunday 30 September, the body of prostitute Elizabeth Stride was discovered at about 1 am in Dutfield's Yard, inside the gateway of 40 Berner Street (since renamed Henriques Street), Whitechapel. She was lying in a pool of blood with her throat cut from left to right. She had been killed just minutes before, and her body was otherwise unmutilated. It is possible that the murderer was disturbed before he could commit any mutilation of the body by someone entering the yard, perhaps Louis Diemschutz, who discovered the body.Cook, p. 157; Woods and Baddeley, p. 86 However, some commentators on the case conclude that Stride's murder was unconnected to the othersSee for example Stewart, William (1939), Jack the Ripper: A New Theory, Quality Press, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 418 on the basis that the body was unmutilated, that it was the only murder to occur south of Whitechapel Road,Marriott, pp.81‚Äì125 and that the blade used might have been shorter and of a different design. Most experts, however, consider the similarities in the case distinctive enough to connect Stride's murder with at least two of the earlier ones, as well as that of Catherine Eddowes on the same night.e.g. Melville Macnaghten quoted by Cook, p. 151; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 584‚Äì587 and Rumbelow, p. 140; Thomas Bond (British physician) quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 360‚Äì362 and Rumbelow, pp. 145‚Äì147 At 1:45 am Catherine Eddowes's mutilated body was found by PC Edward Watkins at the south-west corner of Mitre Square, in the City of London, about 12 minutes walk from Berner Street.Inquest testimony of surveyor Frederick William Foster, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 201‚Äì202; Marriott, p. 138 She had been killed less than 10 minutes earlier by a slash to the throat from left to right with a sharp, pointed knife at least 6 inches (15 cm) long.Examining pathologist Dr Frederick Gordon Brown quoted in Fido, pp. 70‚Äì73 and Marriott, pp. 130‚Äì131 Her face and abdomen were mutilated, and her intestines were drawn out over the right shoulder with a detached length between her torso and left arm. Her left kidney and most of her uterus were removed. The Eddowes inquest was opened on 4 October by Samuel F. Langham, coroner for the City of London.Marriott, pp. 132‚Äì144; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 68 The examining pathologist, Dr Frederick Gordon Brown, believed the perpetrator \\"had considerable knowledge of the position of the organs\\" and from the position of the wounds on the body he could tell that the murderer had knelt to the right of the body, and worked alone.Examining pathologist Dr Frederick Gordon Brown quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 128; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 207; and Marriott, pp. 132‚Äì133, 141‚Äì143 However, the first doctor at the scene, local surgeon Dr George William Sequeira, disputed that the killer possessed anatomical skill or sought particular organs.Sequeira's inquest testimony quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 128; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 208; and Marriott, p. 144 His view was shared by City medical officer William Sedgwick Saunders, who was also present at the autopsy.Saunders's inquest testimony quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 208 Because of this murder's location, the City of London Police under Detective Inspector James McWilliam were brought into the enquiry.Cook, pp. 45‚Äì47; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 178‚Äì181 Catherine Eddowes, 46, lived with partner John Kelly in a lodging-house at 55 Flower and Dean Street.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, pp. 46, 189; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 114‚Äì116; Marriott, p. 81 At 3 am a blood-stained fragment of Eddowes's apron was found lying in the passage of the doorway leading to 108 to 119 Goulston Street, Whitechapel, about a third of a mile (500 m) from the murder scene. There was chalk writing on the wall of the doorway, which read either \\"The Juwes are the men that will not be blamed for nothing\\"Constable Alfred Long's inquest testimony, quoted in Marriott, pp. 148‚Äì149 and Rumbelow, p. 61Letter from Charles Warren to Godfrey Lushington, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, 6 November 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 183‚Äì184 or \\"The Juwes are not the men who will be blamed for nothing.\\"Detective Constable Daniel Halse's inquest testimony, 11 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 214‚Äì215 and Marriott, pp. 150‚Äì151 At 5 am, Commissioner Warren attended the scene and ordered the words erased for fear that they would spark anti-Semitic riots.Letter from Charles Warren to the Home Office Undersecretary of State, 6 November 1888, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 197; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 183‚Äì184 and Marriott, p. 159 Goulston Street was on a direct route from Mitre Square to Flower and Dean Street, where both Stride and Eddowes lived.Inquest testimony of surveyor Frederick William Foster, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 201‚Äì202 The Middlesex coroner, Wynne Baxter, believed that Stride had been attacked with a swift, sudden action.Rumbelow, p. 76 She was still holding a packet of cachous (breath freshening sweets) in her left hand when she was discovered,Testimony of Dr Blackwell, the first surgeon at the scene, quoted by Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 163 and Rumbelow, p. 71 indicating that she had not had time to defend herself.Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 175; Rumbelow, p. 76 A grocer, Matthew Packer, implied to private detectives employed by the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee that he had sold some grapes to Stride and the murderer; however, he had told police that he had shut his shop without seeing anything suspicious.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, pp. 186‚Äì187; Cook, pp. 166‚Äì167; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 106‚Äì108; Rumbelow, p. 76 At the inquest, the pathologists stated emphatically that Stride had not held, swallowed or consumed grapes.Begg, pp. 186‚Äì187; Cook, p. 167; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 164; Rumbelow, p. 76 They described her stomach contents as \\"cheese, potatoes and farinaceous powder [flour or milled grain]\\".Evans and Rumbelow, p. 104; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 158; Rumbelow, p. 72 Nevertheless, Packer's story appeared in the press.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 106‚Äì108; Rumbelow, p. 76 Packer's description of the man did not match the statements by other witnesses who may have seen Stride with a man shortly before her murder, but all but two of the descriptions differed.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, pp. 176‚Äì184 Joseph Lawende passed through Mitre Square with two other men shortly before Eddowes was murdered there, and may have seen her with a man of about 30 years old, who was shabbily dressed, wore a peaked cap, and had a fair moustache.Reported in The Times, 2 October 1888 Chief Inspector Swanson noted that Lawende's description was a near match to another provided by one of the witnesses who may have seen Stride with her murderer.Inspector Donald Swanson's report to the Home Office, 19 October 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 193 However, Lawende stated that he would not be able to identify the man again, and the two other men with Lawende were unable to give descriptions.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, pp. 193‚Äì194; Chief Inspector Swanson's report, 6 November 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 24‚Äì25; Fido, pp. 45, 77 Criticism of the Metropolitan Police and the Home Secretary, Henry Matthews, continued to mount as little progress was made with the investigation.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, pp. 201‚Äì203; Fido, pp. 80‚Äì81 The City Police and the Lord Mayor of London offered a reward of ¬£500 (roughly ¬£ as of ) for information leading to the capture of the villain.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 202; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 141; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 179, 225; Fido, p. 77 The use of bloodhounds to track the killer in the event of another attack was considered and a trial was held in London but the idea was abandoned because the trail of scents was confused in the busy city, the dogs were inexperienced in an urban environment, and the owner Edwin Brough of Wyndyate near Scarborough (now Scalby Manor) was concerned that the dogs would be poisoned by criminals if their role in crime detection became known.Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 291‚Äì299; Fido, p. 134 On 27 September, the Central News Agency received a letter, dubbed the \\"Dear Boss\\" letter, in which the writer, who signed himself \\"Jack the Ripper\\", claimed to have committed the murders.Cook, pp. 76‚Äì77; Woods and Baddeley, pp. 48‚Äì49 On 1 October, a postcard, dubbed the \\"Saucy Jacky\\" postcard and also signed \\"Jack the Ripper\\", was received by the agency. It claimed responsibility for the most recent murders on 30 September, and described the murders of the two women as the \\"double event\\", a designation which has endured.Evans and Skinner (2001), p. 30; Rumbelow, p. 118 On Tuesday 2 October, an unidentified female torso was found in the basement of New Scotland Yard, which was under construction. It was linked to the Whitechapel murders by the press, but it was not included in the Whitechapel murders file, and any connection between the two is now considered unlikely. The case became known as the Whitehall Mystery.Evans and Rumblelow, pp. 142‚Äì144; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 239 On the same day, the psychic Robert James Lees visited Scotland Yard and offered to track down the murderer using paranormal powers; the police turned him away and \\"called [him] a fool and a lunatic\\".Lees's diary quoted in Woods and Baddeley, p. 66 The head of the CID, Anderson, eventually returned from leave on 6 October and took charge of the investigation for Scotland Yard. On 16 October, George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee received another letter claiming to be from the killer. The handwriting and style were unlike that of the \\"Dear Boss\\" letter and \\"Saucy Jacky\\" postcard. The letter arrived with a small box containing half of a human kidney preserved in alcohol. The letter's writer claimed that he had extracted it from the body of Eddowes and that he had \\"fried and ate\\" the missing half.Quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 167; Evans and Skinner (2001), p. 63; Chief Inspector Swanson's report, 6 November 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 185‚Äì188 and Rumbelow, p. 118 Opinion on whether the kidney and the letter were genuine was and is divided.Cook, pp. 144‚Äì149; Evans and Skinner (2001), pp. 54‚Äì71; Fido, pp. 78‚Äì80; Rumbelow, p. 121 By the end of October, the police had interviewed more than 2,000 people, investigated \\"upwards of 300\\", and detained 80.Inspector Donald Swanson's report to the Home Office, 19 October 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 205; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 113; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 125 =Mary Jane Kelly= The body of Mary Jane Kelly, 25, photographed at the scene of her murder On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly was murdered in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 231; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 177 One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was reported to have slept rough there.Daily Telegraph, 10 November 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 339 Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45 am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat.Dr Phillips's inquest testimony, 12 November 1888, quoted in Marriott, p. 176 After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room. Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed.Police surgeon Thomas Bond's report, MEPO 3/3153 ff. 10‚Äì18, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, pp. 242‚Äì243; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 345‚Äì347 and Marriott, pp. 170‚Äì171 Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded neatly on a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle.Inspector Abberline's inquest testimony, 12 November 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 375‚Äì376 and Marriott, p. 177 Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street.Daily Telegraph, 10 November 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 338; Marriott, p. 179; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 86 Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.Marriott, pp. 167‚Äì180 The coroner for North East Middlesex, Dr Roderick Macdonald, MP,Marriott, p. 172 presided over the inquest into Kelly's death at Shoreditch Town Hall on 12 November.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 175, 189; Fido, p. 95; Rumbelow, pp. 94 ff. Amid scenes of great emotion, an \\"enormous crowd\\" of mourners attended Mary Kelly's funeral on 19 November.East London Advertiser, 21 November 1888, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 247 The streets became gridlocked and the cort√®ge struggled to travel from Shoreditch mortuary to the Roman Catholic Cemetery at Leytonstone, where she was laid to rest. On 8 November, Charles Warren resigned as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police after the Home Secretary informed him that he could not make public statements without Home Office approval.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 174; Telegram from Prime Minister Lord Salisbury to Queen Victoria, 11 November 1888, Royal Archives VIC/A67/20, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 357; Fido, p. 137; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 90 James Monro, who had resigned a few months earlier over differences with Warren, was appointed as his replacement in December.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 196 On 10 November, the police surgeon Thomas Bond wrote to Robert Anderson, head of the London CID, detailing the similarities between the five murders of Nichols, Chapman, Stride, Eddowes and Kelly, \\"no doubt committed by the same hand\\".Letter from Thomas Bond to Robert Anderson, 10 November 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 360‚Äì362 and Rumbelow, pp. 145‚Äì147 On the same day, the Cabinet resolved to offer a pardon to any accomplice who came forward with information that led to the conviction of the actual murderer.Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 347‚Äì349 The Metropolitan Police Commissioner reported that the Whitechapel murderer remained unidentified despite 143 extra plain-clothes policemen deployed in Whitechapel in November and December.Letter to the Home Office of 18 July 1889 and Commissioner's Report for 1888, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 204 =Rose Mylett= On Thursday 20 December 1888, a patrolling constable found the strangled body of 26-year-old prostitute Rose Mylett (also known as Catherine Millett and Drunken Lizzie DavisBegg, Jack the Ripper: The Facts, p. 314) in Clarke's Yard, off Poplar High Street.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 245‚Äì246; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 422‚Äì447 Mylett had lodged at 18 George Street, as had Emma Smith.Daily Chronicle, 26 December 1888, quoted in Beadle, William (2009), Jack the Ripper: Unmasked, London: John Blake, , p. 209 Four doctors who examined Mylett's body thought she had been murdered, but Robert Anderson thought she had accidentally hanged herself on the collar of her dress while in a drunken stupor.Robert Anderson to James Monro, 11 January 1889, MEPO 3/143 ff. E‚ÄìJ, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 434‚Äì436 At Anderson's request Dr Bond examined Mylett's body, and he agreed with Anderson.Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 433; Fido, pp. 102‚Äì103 Commissioner Monro also suspected it was a suicide or natural death as there were no signs of a struggle.Report by James Monro, 23 December 1888, HO 144/221/A49301H ff. 7‚Äì14, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 423‚Äì425 The coroner, Wynne Baxter, told the inquest jury that \\"there is no evidence to show that death was the result of violence\\".Quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 433 Nevertheless, the jury returned a verdict of \\"wilful murder against some person or persons unknown\\" and the case was added to the Whitechapel file.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 245‚Äì246 =Alice McKenzie= Alice McKenzie, 40, lived in a lodging-house at 52 Gun Street.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 205‚Äì209; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 448‚Äì468 Alice McKenzie was possibly a prostitute,Rumbelow, p. 129 and was murdered at about 12:40 am on Wednesday 17 July 1889 in Castle Alley, Whitechapel. Like most of the previous murders, her left carotid artery was severed from left to right and there were wounds on her abdomen. However, her wounds were not as deep as in previous murders, and a shorter blade was used. Commissioner MonroEvans and Rumbelow, pp. 207‚Äì208; Evans and Skinner (2001), p. 137 and one of the pathologists examining the body, Bond, believed this to be a Ripper murder, though another of the pathologists, Phillips, and Robert Anderson disagreed,Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 208‚Äì209; Marriott, pp. 182‚Äì183 as did Inspector Abberline.Interview in Cassell's Saturday Journal, 28 May 1892, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 225 Later writers are also divided, and either suggest that McKenzie was a Ripper victim,Marriott, p. 195 or that the unknown murderer tried to make it look like a Ripper killing to deflect suspicion from himself.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 209 At the inquest, Coroner Baxter acknowledged both possibilities, and concluded: \\"There is great similarity between this and the other class of cases, which have happened in this neighbourhood, and if the same person has not committed this crime, it is clearly an imitation of the other cases.\\"Coroner Baxter's summing up, 14 August 1888, quoted in Marriott, p. 193 =Pinchin Street torso= Contemporary illustration of the discovery of the Pinchin Street torso A woman's torso was found at 5:15 a.m. on Tuesday 10 September 1889 under a railway arch in Pinchin Street, Whitechapel.Eddleston, p. 129 Extensive bruising about the victim's back, hip, and arm indicated that she had been severely beaten shortly before her death, which had occurred approximately one day prior to the discovery of her torso. The victim's abdomen was also extensively mutilated in a manner reminiscent of the Ripper, although her genitals had not been wounded.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Facts, p. 316 The dismembered sections of the body are believed to have been transported to the railway arch, hidden under an old chemise.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 210; Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 480‚Äì515 The age of the victim was estimated at 30‚Äì40 years.Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 489‚Äì510 Despite a search of the area, no other sections of her body were ever found, and neither the victim nor the culprit were ever identified. Chief Inspector Swanson and Commissioner Monro noted that the presence of blood within the torso indicated that death was not from haemorrhage or cutting of the throat.Report to the Home Office by Swanson, 10 September 1889, MEPO 3/140 ff. 136‚Äì40, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 480‚Äì482; Report to the Home Office by Monro, 11 September 1889, HO 144/221/A49301K ff. 1‚Äì8, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 492‚Äì494 The pathologists, however, noted that the general bloodlessness of the tissues and vessels indicated that haemorrhage was the cause of death.Report of Dr Charles A. Hebbert, 16 September 1889, MEPO 3/140 ff. 146‚Äì7, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 496‚Äì497; inquest testimony of George Bagster Phillips, 24 September 1889, quoted in Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 509‚Äì510 Newspaper speculation that the body belonged to Lydia Hart, who had disappeared, was refuted after she was found recovering in hospital after \\"a bit of a spree\\".Evans and Rumbelow, p. 213 Another claim that the victim was a missing girl called Emily Barker was also refuted, as the torso was from an older and taller woman. Swanson did not consider this a Ripper case, and instead suggested a link to the Thames Torso Murders in Rainham and Chelsea, as well as the \\"Whitehall Mystery\\".Report to the Home Office by Swanson, 10 September 1889, MEPO 3/140 ff. 136‚Äì40, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 210‚Äì213 and Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 480‚Äì482 Monro agreed with Swanson's assessment.Report to the Home Office by Monro, 11 September 1889, HO 144/221/A49301K ff. 1‚Äì8, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 213 and Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 492‚Äì494 These three murders and the Pinchin Street case are suggested to be the work of a serial killer, nicknamed the \\"Torso killer\\", who could either be the same person as \\"Jack the Ripper\\" or a separate killer of uncertain connection.Gordon, R. Michael (2002), The Thames Torso Murders of Victorian London, McFarland & Company, Links between these and three further murders‚Äîthe \\"Battersea Mystery\\" of 1873 and 1874, in which two women were found dismembered, and the 1884 \\"Tottenham Court Road Mystery\\"‚Äîhave also been postulated. Experts on the murders‚Äîcolloquially known as \\"Ripperologists\\"‚Äîsuch as Stewart Evans, Keith Skinner, Martin Fido, and Donald Rumbelow, discount any connection between the torso and Ripper killings on the basis of their different modi operandi.Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 480; Fido, p. 104; Rumbelow, p. 132 Monro was replaced as Commissioner by Sir Edward Bradford on 21 June 1890, after a disagreement with the Home Secretary Henry Matthews over police pensions.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 217 =Frances Coles= Frances Coles, 25, lived in a lodging-house in White's Row.Fido, p. 113; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 551‚Äì557 The last of the murders in the Whitechapel file was committed on Friday 13 February 1891 when 25-year-old prostitute Frances Coles was murdered under a railway arch in Swallow Gardens, Whitechapel. Her body was found by PC Ernest Thompson only moments after the attack at 2:15 am. Coles was lying beneath a passageway under a railway arch between Chamber Street and Royal Mint Street. She was still alive, but died before medical help could arrive.Cook, pp. 53‚Äì55; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 218‚Äì219; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 551 Minor wounds on the back of her head suggest that she was thrown violently to the ground before her throat was cut at least twice, from left to right and then back again.Examining pathologist Dr Phillips, and Dr F. J. Oxley, first doctor at the scene, quoted in Marriott, p. 198 Otherwise there were no mutilations to the body, leading some to believe Thompson had disturbed her assailant.Cook, p. 237; Marriott, p. 198 Superintendent Arnold and Inspector Reid arrived soon afterwards from the nearby Leman Street police station, and Chief Inspectors Donald Swanson and Henry Moore, who had been involved in the previous murder investigations, arrived by 5 am.Fido, pp. 104‚Äì105 A man named James Sadler, who had earlier been seen with Coles, was arrested by the police and charged with her murder. A high-profile investigation by Swanson and Moore into Sadler's past history and his whereabouts at the time of the previous Whitechapel murders indicates that the police may have suspected him to be the Ripper. However, Sadler was released on 3 March for lack of evidence.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 220‚Äì222; Evans and Skinner (2000), pp. 551‚Äì568 Legacy February 1889 National Police Gazette illustration referencing the Whitechapel murders The murderer or murderers were never identified and the cases remain unsolved. Sensational reportage and the mystery surrounding the identity of the killer or killers fed the development of the character \\"Jack the Ripper\\", who was blamed for all or most of the murders. Hundreds of books and articles discuss the Whitechapel murders, and they feature in novels, short stories, comic books, television shows, and films of multiple genres. The poor of the East End had long been ignored by affluent society, but the nature of the Whitechapel murders and of the victims' impoverished lifestyles drew national attention to their living conditions.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, pp. 1‚Äì2 The murders galvanised public opinion against the overcrowded, unsanitary slums of the East End, and led to demands for reform.Cook, pp. 139‚Äì141; Werner (ed.), pp. 236‚Äì237 On 24 September 1888, George Bernard Shaw commented sarcastically on the media's sudden concern with social justice in a letter to The Star newspaper:Ryder, Stephen P.

Rossi was best known for his books on the Gulag. Early life He was born as Franz Xaver Heyman and was the son of architect Martin (Marcin) Heyman and L√©ontine Charlotte Goyet who was for a time governess in Kalisz. In 1962, in Poland, he changed his name from Franciszek Ksawiery Heyman to Jacek Franciszek Rossi - perhaps in recognition of his real father's name. Political associations He was a member of the Communist Party of Poland as well as of the comintern. He participated in the Spanish Civil War. At one time, he worked for Leon Trotsky and interpreted for Stalin. In 1937, he was called to Moscow and, most likely due to his prior connection with Trotsky, was imprisoned in Soviet camps until after Stalin's death in 1953. In 1961 he returned to Warsaw with the help of his brother Piotr Heyman. Career A polyglot, he was a lecturer in the University of Warsaw School of Foreign Languages under the name Jacek Rossi. He lived in Warsaw till about 1980. In 1985 he traveled to France and was naturalized as a French citizen. In the late 1980s, he spent time as a visiting scholar at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. where he wrote his memoires and an \\"encyclopedia on the Gulag\\" as he referred to it in conversation. Publications As Jacques Rossi he wrote about his experiences of the Gulag - The Gulag Handbook, which was originally written in Russian and was translated into French (1997), English (1987), Japanese (1996), Czech (1999), Italian (2006). At the end of his life he recorded a series of interviews which were subsequently published as Jacques, le Fran√ßais : pour m√©moire du Goulag.

He specialized in malacology and ichthyology. Life Garrett was born in Albany, New York; his family moved to Middlebury, Vermont, when he was a child. Considering himself a \\"Vermontian\\" throughout his life, he went to sea at age 16 (after an apprenticeship in a local iron foundry) mainly to get away and collect sea shells. Making Hawaii his home from 1857 to 1863, Garrett was initially supported and sponsored by local shell collectors, including the malacologist William Harper Pease. They admired his zeal and sense of adventure as together they found new species and developed a keen sense for scientific details. Soon they were publishing papers on the topic of conchology, for both for local and international scientists - mostly under Pease's name. Running out of funds, Garrett approached the ichthyologist Louis Agassiz, who had moved from his native Switzerland to head the new department of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. Within the year he was part of a team that hunted for unusual species all over Polynesia, to sketch and paint them as lifelike as possible and send fishes conserved in alcohol for the growing collection at Harvard. Completely self-taught, Garrett became a renowned and admired specialist in the field himself: a skilled artist and adventurer-scientist, he eventually found a new sponsor in Cesar Godeffroy, a wealthy scion of international commerce based in Hamburg, Germany. This support helped him explore and describe the shells and fishes of Eastern Polynesia: Samoa, Fiji and other locations. Settling on the island of Huahine in 1870, he made it his home and headquarters as he kept collecting shells, fish and eventually also native tools and artifacts, of anthropological importance, to the Museum Godeffroy in Germany until 1879, when Godeffroy went bankrupt. Garrett's seminal work Fische der Sundsee was first published in 1872 and remained of primary importance for the next generation of ichthyologists. He never returned to the United States, and died on November 1, 1887, on the island of Huahine where he had put down roots. Rumor has it that he wrote his own obituary, and had the local missionary Ebenezer Cooper (from the London Missionary Society) send it out into the world he had left behind in his wanderings.

It is the southern terminus of the Middleborough/Lakeville Line; it also serves seasonal CapeFlyer service. Middleborough/Lakeville has a single full-length high-level platform serving the line's single track. An older station was located in downtown Middleborough, serving passenger service from 1846 to 1959 and Cape Cod and Hyannis Railroad service from 1984 to 1988. The current station opened along with the rest of the Old Colony Lines on September 29, 1997, and CapeFlyer service began in 2013. The station is planned to be closed to commuter rail service when the new Middleborough station opens in 2023 as part of South Coast Rail, though it will remain open for CapeFlyer and additional commuter parking. History =Former service= alt=A postcard showing a Tudor-style railroad station The Fall River Railroad opened between South Braintree and Fall River in stages from June 1945 to December 1946. Middleborough station was located at Courtland Street at the west edge of the downtown area. Two other stations were located in Middleborough on the 1856-opened Cape Main Line south of downtown: Rock (also known as Rock Meeting House) at Miller Street in Rock Village, and South Middleboro at Spruce Street. Middleborough became a major railroad junction, with lines in five directions to Boston, Plymouth, Cape Cod, Fall River, and Taunton by 1892. Service declined in the 20th century, with the lines to Plymouth and Fall River abandoned in the 1930s; Rock and South Middleboro stations were closed on July 17, 1938, as part of a massive station closure. Commuter service between Cape Cod and Boston via Middleborough ended on June 30, 1959. The lines north, west, and southeast from Middleborough remained in use for freight service: by the New Haven until 1969, Penn Central to 1971, Conrail to 1997, and CSX since. Freight service southeast from Middleborough was taken over by the Bay Colony Railroad shortline in 1982 and the Massachusetts Coastal Railroad in 2007, interchanging with CSX at Middleborough Yard. =MBTA era= alt=Three-story apartment buildings and a parking lot Restoration of passenger service was proposed intermittently through the 1960s and 1970s. On October 15, 1979, a special train ran from Braintree to Middleborough to publicize the state's plans for restored service. A 1974 state analysis of restoring commuter rail service indicated that the Middleborough station could be reused. From 1984 to 1988, Cape Cod and Hyannis Railroad seasonal commuter and excursion service stopped in Middleborough at the former station. The former station was demolished in the 1990s. In 1984, a state-directed MBTA study found that restoration of commuter rail service would be feasible. A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was released in May 1990, followed by a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) in 1992. Both called for a Middleborough/Lakeville station off Route 105 south of Middleborough on the Lakeville border, rather than reusing the old station site. MBTA Commuter Rail Middleborough/Lakeville Line service to Middleborough/Lakeville station began on September 29, 1997. The station opened with 400 parking spaces; this was increased to 864 spaces due to demand but later reduced to 735. The station attracted transit-oriented development in the form of adjacent apartment complexes. A 2007 study of commuter service to Wareham and Buzzards Bay proposed an infill stop near the former Rock station site. CapeFLYER summer weekend service between Boston and Hyannis began on May 24, 2013 with a stop at Middleborough/Lakeville. =South Coast Rail= In 2017, the South Coast Rail project was re-evaluated due to cost issues. The new proposal called for early service via Middleborough by 2022, followed by full service via Stoughton by 2030. A new Middleborough station was to replace the existing Middleborough/Lakeville station, which could not be served by South Coast Rail trains. Middleborough and Lakeville officials were critical of the possibility of abandoning the current Middleborough/Lakeville station or requiring its riders to take a shuttle train, as well as possible traffic issues from a downtown Middleborough station. The January 2018 Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report considered three potential operational patterns: a reverse move to serve the existing station, shuttle service from the existing station to Bridgewater station, or a new Middleborough station with a bus shuttle from the existing station. The latter was preferred because it had a shorter travel time than the reverse move, and would not require new double track as the Bridgewater shuttle would. The new Middleborough station will be located in the wye (Pilgrim Junction) between the Middleborough Main Line and Middleboro Secondary. The CapeFLYER will continue to use Middleborough/Lakeville station, as the new station will not have a platform on the Middleborough Main Line. However, the new station includes space for a future platform to serve shuttle trains to Cape Cod. A construction contract for the new station was awarded in August 2020; it is expected to open in late 2023.

The Romans, led by Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, recaptured the city of Tarentum that had betrayed them in the first Battle of Tarentum in 212 BC. This time the commander of the city, Carthalo, turned against the Carthaginians, and supported the Romans. The siege According to Plutarch, a Greek biographer, Fabius won the city of Tarentum through treachery. One of the soldiers in Fabius's army had a sister in Tarentum who was the lover of the Bruttian commander, Carthalo, who Hannibal had left in charge of the city. Carthalo was swayed to the Roman side and agreed to help the Romans gain entry into Tarentum. However Plutarch also writes that another story is that it was Fabius's Bruttian mistress who seduced the commander over to the Roman side when she discovered that he was a fellow countryman. Fabius drew Hannibal away from Tarentum by sending the garrison of Rhegium to plunder the lands of the Bruttians and to take Caulonia. Hannibal went to the aid of the Bruttians. On the sixth day of the siege it was arranged that the commander would help the Romans gain entry to Tarentum. Fabius took a cohort to the appointed place while the rest of the army attacked the walls, luring the cities defenders away. The Bruttian gave the signal and Fabius and his men scaled the walls and took the city. (Plutarch does not mention what the Bruttian commander does to aid the Romans) Aftermath of the capture of Tarentum In the Life of Fabius Maximus (22.4), Plutarch writes that \\"At this point, however, Fabius's ambition seems to have proved stronger than his principles.\\" This seems to be true, as after capturing the city, Fabius ordered that the Bruttians stationed in the city were to be killed to ensure no knowledge of the treachery spread to Rome. After that, a number of Tarentines were killed with 30,000 being sold into slavery. The Roman army ransacked the city, stealing 3,000 Attic talents to enrich the treasury, though on the orders of Fabius the statues and paintings of the Gods were left apart from the statue of Hercules which was taken to Rome. Fabius's victory allowed him to celebrate his second triumph. According to Plutarch (Life of Fabius Maximus 23.1), Hannibal was within five miles when Tarentum fell to the Romans. He is said to have remarked in public that \\"It seems that the Romans have found another Hannibal, for we have lost Tarentum in the same way we took it.\\"Ian Scott- Kilvert (trans.), Plutarch: Makers of Rome (Penguin, 1965), p. 78.

She starred in some 15 films between 1920 and 1956.  Biography  Germaine Sablon was born into an artistic family: daughter of Charles Sablon (composer born in 1871), sister of Andr√© Sablon (composer), of Jean Sablon (popular singer) and of Marcel Sablon, (director of the Monte Carlo Ballet) and later, she became the aunt of actor Jacques Sablon. Germaine Sablon began a career as an operetta singer in 1915. From 1919, she played in silent films. Married twice, in 1918 to Maurice Bloch, then in 1921 to Charles Legrand, she was for many years the companion of the writer Joseph Kessel. She interrupted her career in the 1920s to give birth to two sons. As early as 1932, she started recording her songs. At the same time, her career as an actress underwent a considerable turning point with the advent of talking films. With the Fall of France in 1940, she left Paris for Saint-Rapha√´l. She stayed with Joseph Kessel (with whom, as noted, she would start a long relationship) and his nephew Maurice Druon. Along with Andr√© Girard and Andr√© Gillois, she joined the Resistance fight against the Nazi occupier. In 1941 she took refuge in Switzerland, then in London in 1943.

He was the progenitor of the junior branch of the Bhonsle family which ruled Thanjavur until the formal annexation of the kingdom by the British in 1855.  Early career  Venkoji was the younger son of Shahji Bhonsle, a military commander in service of the Sultan of Bijapur through his younger wife Tukabai Mohite. He succeeded to the Karnataka portion of Shahaji's empire.  Conquest of Thanjavur  Interior of Durbar Hall, Thanjavur Maratha palace In 1673, the Nayak of Madurai invaded the kingdom of Thanjavur under the rule of the Thanjavur Nayaks and drove away the ruler. He then proceeded to place his younger brother Alagiri Nayak on the throne of Thanjavur. This was resented by Rayasam Venkanna, a high-ranking official in the court of Thanjavur who supported the cause of Chengamala Dasu, the deposed son of Vijayaraghava, the late Nayak of Thanjavur. He proceeded to the court of the Ali Adil Shahi II of Bijapur along with the minor Chengamaldas and requested his help. The Adil Shah sent Venkoji to invade Thanjavur and restore the throne to the old line of nayaks. A Sanskrit manuscript Bosalavamsavali narrates how Venkoji conquered Arni and proceeded to Thanjavur to liberate it from the shackles of the Nayak of Tiruchirapalli. The manuscript further narrates that While camping at Tirumalapadi near Tiruvadi, God appeared to him in a dream and asked him not to leave for home. However, Wilkes assigns different reasons for the usurpation of the Maratha. He is of the view that Venkoji was not pleased with the conduct of Chengamaldas who refused to pay the war expenses. Assisted by Rayasam Venkanna who had switched sides once more, Venkoji conquered Ayyampettai and defeated Alagiri who had now also fallen out with his brother Chokkanatha Nayak as well as Changamaldas and secured the throne for himself. On the death of the Sultan of Bijapur, he crowned himself as the independent king of Thanjavur.  Reign  = Dates of Ekoji I's reign = The Marathi inscriptions of the Thanjavur temple dates the capture of Thanjavur to January 1676. The Madras Tamil manuscript assigns the dates 1675 and 1679 to the conquest and end of Ekoji I's reign respectively. Likewise, the Marathi inscriptions assigns Ekoji's death to 1684. However, Wilkes asserts that Ekoji was well alive in 1686-1687. The records of the British East India Company mention a king called Ekoji as late as 1699-1700. However, Dharmakuta a commentary on the Ramayana suggests that Ekoji might have abdicated in the year 1684 in favor of his son Shahuji. However, it is quite unclear as to how many years he lived after the event. = Clash with Shivaji = In 1676-1677 Shivaji made an expedition to the Carnatic to claim his portion of the jagir, also desiring to bring the whole of South India under Maratha rule. With this aim in mind, he made a treaty with Golconda, took Gingee and proceeded to Thanjavur after conquering all the lands north of the Coleroon river. But a Mughal Empire invasion forced him to turn back. He placed Vellore under the rule of a half-brother named Santoji. Ekoji I reacted by launching regular military campaigns into Santoji's territory with the intention of driving him away. However, in 1680, Bijapur succumbed to the invasions of Shivaji and handed over the administration of all lands to the north of the Coleroon river to Shivaji. Ekoji I was forced to become a vassal of Shivaji and pay him tribute. On the death of Shivaji, however, the tribute was stopped and Thanjavur retained its independent existence. = Alliance with Ramnad = The chiefs of Ramnad had been vassals of the Nayaks of Madurai. However, the new ruler Kilavan desired to become independent. With this aim in mind, he concluded an alliance with Ekoji I and rebelled against his overlord. The battle ended in the reign of Shahuji I with the defeat of Madurai and the liberation of Ramnad.  Literature  Sanskrit and Telugu literature flourished during this period. The king himself is said to have composed a Telugu version of the Ramayana.

Life  She was born Alice Golay in the small Swiss municipality of Rovray, in the Canton of Vaud, the only child of Paul Golay and Ida Ettler, both strong Calvinists. Her mother had been a deaconess before deciding to leave that life to marry, while her father was a school teacher at the time of her birth. With a growing embrace of socialism, he later gave up that career and became a writer for the leftist periodical, Le Grutl√©en, for which the family moved to Lausanne. Alice Rivaz' later writings are thought to reflect the conflict the couple experienced as a result of their differing points of view, with her mother's piety butting up against her father's political convictions. At the age of 25 Rivaz moved to Geneva, where she spent the rest of her life. She originally studied music, training to become a pianist. After several years of work with the International Labour Organization she turned to writing, and became one of the foremost French language writers of Switzerland. She died in that city at the age of 96 and was buried at the prestigious Cimeti√®re des Rois. Alice Rivaz ‚Äì Cimeti√®re des Rois In her birthplace there is a commemorative plaque. In Geneva a street and a College were named after her. And since 2002 there is even an Intercity train called Alice Rivaz.  Writing  Rivaz began working on her first novel around 1937, which came to be titled Nuages dans la main (Clouds in your Hands), published in 1940. Her novel Jette ton pain (Cast your Bread), published in 1979, is considered her finest work. Her writings are known for dealing with women in art and in the family, as well as having feminist themes. Along with novels, short stories, essays and diaries she also did a study of poet Jean-Georges Lossier. Bibliography * Nuages dans la main novel, (1940) trans.

The case was originally told by Don Harper Mills, then president of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, in a speech at a banquet in 1987. After it began to circulate on the internet as a factual story and attained the status of urban legend, Mills stated that he made it up as an illustrative anecdote \\"to show how different legal consequences can follow each twist in a homicide inquiry\\". The story first appeared on the Internet in August 1994 and has been widely circulated since, on webpages, in chat rooms, and even print publications. The reprints often include Mills's name and place it at a 1994 event, or attribute it to a supposed Associated Press report of the banquet. Mills expresses little surprise, calling it \\"a fabulous story\\", and has fielded numerous inquiries about it over the years. The incident has been adapted for various media, notably the Paul Thomas Anderson film Magnolia (1999) in which the protagonist is reimagined as \\"Sydney Barringer\\". The case The popular account of the story is told as follows: :On March 23, 1994, a medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he died from a gunshot wound of the head caused by a shotgun. Investigation to that point had revealed that the decedent had jumped from the top of a ten- story building with the intent to commit suicide. (He left a note indicating his despondency.) As he passed the 9th floor on the way down, his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast through a window, killing him instantly. Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a safety net had been erected at the 8th floor level to protect some window washers, and that the decedent would most likely not have been able to complete his intent to commit suicide because of this. :Ordinarily, a person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds, even if the mechanism might not be what they intended, is defined as having committed suicide. That he was shot on the way to certain death nine storeys below probably would not change his mode of death from suicide to homicide, but the fact that his suicide intent would not have been achieved under any circumstance caused the medical examiner to feel that he had homicide on his hands. :Further investigation led to the discovery that the room on the 9th floor whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. He was threatening her with the shotgun because of an interspousal spat and became so upset that he could not hold the shotgun straight. Therefore, when he pulled the trigger, he completely missed his wife, and the pellets went through the window, striking the decedent. :When one intends to kill subject A but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. The old man was confronted with this conclusion, but both he and his wife were adamant in stating that neither knew that the shotgun was loaded. It was the longtime habit of the old man to threaten his wife with an unloaded shotgun. He had no intent to murder her; therefore, the killing of the decedent appeared then to be accident. That is, the gun had been accidentally loaded. :But further investigation turned up a witness that their son was seen loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the fatal accident. That investigation showed that the mother (the old lady) had cut off her son's financial support, and her son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that the father would shoot his mother. The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus. :Now comes the exquisite twist. Further investigation revealed that the son, Ronald Opus himself, had become increasingly despondent over the failure of his attempt to get his mother murdered. This led him to jump off the ten-story building on March 23, only to be killed by a shotgun blast through a 9th story window. :The medical examiner closed the case as a suicide. In popular culture The case has appeared in the following shows and film: *TV series Homicide, episode 6.11 - \\"Shaggy Dog, City Goat\\". *The case was reported as true on Art Bell's Coast to Coast AM in 1995. *Law & Order, in which District Attorney Ben Stone merely offered a hypothetical example of a man who jumped off the Empire State Building because he wanted a ham sandwich and was shot on the way down by someone who thought he was committing suicide. *Law & Order, episode 13.18 - \\"Maritime\\" Medical Examiner Elizabeth Rodgers talks briefly about a man that guy jumped off a building and was shot by a bullet on the way down, the medical examiner did not know what to rule it a suicide or homicide. *In Australian TV show Murder Call, in a 1998 episode. *In the 1999 film Magnolia, written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, although in this version some parts of the story are changed and several details are added to give more consistency to the plot. *In the CSI: Miami episode \\"Spring Breakdown\\", a man was pushed off a building and was shot by a flare gun on the way down. *In the popular game Hitman: Blood Money, after the player finishes the second last mission, Amendment XXV, there will be a news article about a man who committed suicide after failing to kill two Russian exchange students by poisoning their drinks and loading their gun with a bullet in hopes they will shoot each other during a Russian roulette. After failing to do so, he then tried to commit suicide by jumping from the 8th floor of his apartment building but got shot by said students during their Russian roulette game and subsequently died from the shot before falling towards the safety net below. *The first track on the 2013 album Etiquette by Silvery is entitled \\"The Ronald Opus\\" and references the story. * Sunday magazine edition of Pakistani newspaper Dunya featured it in its Sunday edition on 26 March 2016. * Referenced as part of Thunder McQueen's backstory in the sixth arc of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Stone Ocean.

Life and career  Sheppard and Balcombe both worked for the Post Office as telecommunications engineers. They became rock climbing partners and while based in Bristol became interested in the caves of the Mendip Hills, particularly Swildon's Hole which they believed connected to Wookey Hole Caves. They proved this by putting dye into the water at Swildon's and seeing it emerge at Wookey. Various attempts were made to enter these underwater cave systems using shore-based pumped-air diving suits, without much success. An initial dive in 1934 was unsuccessful and the first successful dive was the following year at Wookey Hole. They returned with improved equipment and succeeded in further exploration. Sheppard constructed his own dry suit, incorporating an oxygen rebreathing system, and used this to make the first successful cave dive in Swildon's Hole on 4 October 1936. For the initial 1934 dive Sheppard and colleague Francis Graham Balcombe constructed the first underwater breathing apparatus for cave diving. This amazing contraption was constructed with recycled household items, including a bicycle pump and tobacco tin. It provided the means for the pioneering exploration of Swildon's Hole and other caves in Mendip. The bicycle respirator is composed of several key elements: rubber mouth attachment, a flexible hosepipe, bicycle pump and tobacco tin stopper, all held together with metal clips. It is a kind of homemade snorkel but designed to be attached to a pump to supply the air for underwater cave diving. The bicycle respirator can be seen at Wells and Mendip Museum. During his later life, Jack Sheppard was made Honorary President of the Cave Diving Group.

The Manueline style (circa 1490‚Äì1535) was a transitional style that combined Renaissance and Gothic ornamental elements to buildings that were architectonically closer to Gothic architecture, as is the Isabelline style of Spain. Manueline was succeeded by a brief Early Renaissance phase (c. 1530‚Äì1550), closer to Classical canons, followed by the adoption of Mannerist (late Renaissance) forms. Portuguese Mannerism, specially in secular architecture, is characterised by simplicity in the organisation of fa√ßades and relative lack of decoration, being often referred to as Estilo Ch√£o (plain style). Even with the arrival of Baroque architecture in the late 17th century, Portuguese architecture continued to use Mannerist forms well into the 18th century. Religious architecture Manueline nave of the Jer√≥nimos Monastery in Lisbon One of the most important examples of Manueline style is the Jer√≥nimos Monastery at Lisbon, in which Renaissance ornaments decorate portals, church columns and cloisters. The definitive abandonment of Gothic architecture and the first \\"pure\\" Renaissance structures appear later in the 16th century, under King John III, like the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o in Tomar (1532‚Äì40), the Porta Especiosa of Coimbra Cathedral and the Gra√ßa Church at √âvora (c. 1530-1540), as well as the cloisters of the Cathedral of Viseu (c. 1528-1534) and Convent of Christ in Tomar (John III Cloisters, 1557‚Äì1591). Manueline churches like that of Jer√≥nimos Monastery anticipated the unification of inner space (see Hall Church) that would characterise Renaissance churches like the Mercy Church of Santar√©m (after 1559), the Santo Ant√£o Church of √âvora (1557‚Äì63) and the cathedrals of Leiria (after 1550) and Portalegre (after 1556). S√£o Roque Church (1565‚Äì87) and the Mannerist Monastery of S√£o Vicente de Fora (1582‚Äì1629), both located in Lisbon, heavily influenced religious architecture in both Portugal and its colonies overseas in the next centuries. Mannerist churches influenced by these include the Jesuit churches of Coimbra (New Cathedral of Coimbra, started 1598) and Salvador da Bahia, in Brazil (now Cathedral of Salvador, second half of the 17th century). Secular architecture Casa dos Bicos, Lisbon An important and rare example of urban palace of the Renaissance is the Casa dos Bicos (c. 1525) in Lisbon, with a fa√ßade covered with diamond reliefs in Italian fashion. During the first half of the 16th century, the Portuguese nobility built various quintas (manor houses) in the area surrounding Lisbon. Among these, the Quinta da Bacalhoa (1528‚Äì1554), near Set√∫bal, is the most important, although recently ruined and degraded after its sale to a winery. In contrast to Portuguese mediaeval palaces like the Royal Palace at Sintra, the fa√ßades of Bacalhoa have a symmetrical arrangement of windows, loggias and towers and the building is surrounded by an artificial lake and geometrical gardens, an ensemble that reveals Italian inspiration. Also near Set√∫bal is located the Quinta das Torres (c. 1560), also characterised by its symmetrical fa√ßades and a pavilion in the middle of its artificial lake. The Ribeira Palace of Lisbon, a royal palace built in the early 16th century in Manueline style by King Manuel I, was remodelled towards the end of the 16th century by the orders of Philip I (Philip II of Spain). At this time the fa√ßade of the palace was modernised and a large Renaissance-style tower with a dome was built by the Tagus river. The palace and its prominent tower dominated the cityscape of Lisbon until 1755, when the Great Lisbon earthquake destroyed it. With the royal palace destroyed, perhaps the most important late Renaissance palace in Portugal is the Ducal Palace of Vila Vi√ßosa, built between the late 16th and early 17th centuries for the Dukes of Braganza.

Schmidt's missionary work took him to Queensland and Samoa, where he founded a number of Lutheran institutions and settlements. Early life Schmidt was born in Stargard, Pomerania (now Poland). He studied at the Universities of Halle and Berlin, before becoming the first theological student of Johannes Gossner, a minister of the Bethlehem Bohemian Church in Berlin. Gossner was the founder of the Evangelical Union for the Spread of Christianity among the Heathen, and he recommended Schmidt to lead a party of nine missionaries trained for work with a British society. In 1837, Schmidt came to the notice of Rev John Dunmore Lang in Australia, via Samuel Johnson, a friend of Gossner's in London. After being joined by fellow missionary Christopher Eipper in Greenock, Scotland, Schmidt and his party set sail for Australia on the Minerva. Conditions aboard the ship were harsh, with Moritz Schneider, a surgeon employed by Lang, dying of typhoid en route. Schmidt arrived in Sydney in January 1838. Missionary Work in Australia =Sydney= Upon arrival in Australia, Schmidt was admitted as a member of Lang's Presbyterian Synod of New South Wales on 15 March 1838. He founded the New South Wales Society in aid of the German Mission to the Aborigines, whose mission involved supporting a mission in connection with government funding. Schmidt ministered to a German congregation in Sydney for some months while a party scouted in the Moreton Bay area for a suitable site. Upon arrival in Brisbane in June 1838, Schmidt found that his scouting party had selected a location north of the settlement that they called Zion's Hill. =Zion's Hill Mission= He was the leader of the first European settlement in what is now the area of Nundah, Queensland, when he helped found the \\"Zion Hill\\" mission, located near to the modern-day \\"Walkers Way\\". Although joined by fellow German missionary Reverend Christopher Eipper, Schmidt did not have much success in bringing Christianity to the Aboriginal people in the area, and his mission was dismantled at the behest of the colonial government in 1846. =Kilcoy Poisoning= Schmidt was also notable for being involved in leaking the details of a deliberate mass poisoning of Aboriginal people at Kilcoy in Queensland to the Sydney press. Schmidt had recorded in his travel diary the details of the incident, in which as many as sixty Aboriginal people were given flour and other rations laced with strychnine by white settlers. Not wanting to upset the delicate situation and cause any reprisal attacks, the authorities attempted to hush up the affair. Fellow minister and evangelical reformer John Dunmore Lang published the details from Schmidt's travel diary in the Colonial Observer, causing a major scandal in Sydney, the colonial capital. Return to Europe, and Samoa Following the failure of the Zion's Hill mission, Schmidt returned to England in 1846. He briefly ministered to a Lutheran congregation in London before being accepted by the London Missionary Society. From 1848 to 1857, he served as a missionary in Samoa. On May 25, 1855, his wife died, and in 1857 he resigned from the society and started a free school for the children of foreign residents of the city of Apia in Samoa. Around this time he also married Salaneta, a Samoan woman, with whom he had one son. He died in Apia in early 1864.

The site documents more than 4,000 years of more-or-less continuous occupation of the area now occupied by the modern village of Nikolski. The site includes a large midden, yielding much information about the origins of the Aleut people. Description The major feature of the site is its large midden, a mound about long, wide, and deep. Excavations at the site have yielded more than 4,000 artifacts, including a wide variety of projectile points, made from ivory, bone, and stone. The site has also yielded one of the oldest radiocarbon dates in the Aleutian Islands, documenting human activity there as early as 1,800 BCE. Human remains identified as Paleo-Aleut in age have been recovered from the site, as have stone lamps, stone knives of a type similar to those found at Dorset culture sites, and carved ivory deity images. The site was first identified as of archaeological interest in 1909, and its first major excavation took place in 1938 under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution's Ale≈° Hrdliƒçka. It has since been a regular subject of study. One of the most important excavations took place in 1962 under the leadership of William S. Laughlin, in which two wide trenches were dug, and the stratigraphy of the midden carefully documented. The Chaluka site is unique because it supported a continuous population for nearly 3500 years and reveals a very precise food sourcing system that sustains the fostering of faunal life. Mathematical figures were used to manage natural stocks. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1962, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.

It is a multi-component site, whose stratified remains have yielded evidence of human occupation as far back as 11,000 years ago. The site is located on the northern flanks of the Alaska Range, near Healy, Alaska, in the Nenana River watershed. There are four major components to the site, layered in an outwash terrace overlooking Dry Creek, with layers of loess (wind-deposited materials) separating them. The most recent component of the site dates to 2600-1400 BCE. The youngest component is one of the few places in the Alaskan interior where notched projectile points have been found. The two oldest components are dated to 8,500-9,000 BCE, and include assemblages of microblade stone technology. The bottom layer yielded a collection of more than 3,500 artifacts, primarily stone flakes. One of the more prominent finds is a stone scraping tool with a triangular head, measuring . Multiple types of stone tools have been found at the site, as have remains of processing a variety of animals. The site is valuable for the insight it yields into the critical transitional period at the end of the most recent Ice Age. The site was first discovered by C. E.

Kleinschmidt studied commerce and went to the United States of America in 1843. He launched out in business in Saint Louis (Missouri) but went bankrupt and had to leave for Australia then on to Fiji to flee his creditors. But his trade with the natives was not brilliant, in particular because of the economic crisis of 1874. The Museum Godeffroy of Hamburg then offered a new opportunity to him. The institution charged him with collecting natural history specimens, fauna and flora, in the Solomon Islands and New Hebrides, territories largely unexplored hitherto.

His film The Whole Shootin' Match (1978) is often credited with inspiring Robert Redford to start the Sundance Institute.Roger Ebert \\"The Whole Shootin' Match \\" rogerebert.com. December 28, 2007.  Early Life  Born Glenn Irwin Pinnell in Andrews, Texas, Pennell grew up in Lubbock and College Station, where his father Charles taught engineering at Texas A & M University. He became interested in film as a teenager and would use his father's Super 8 camera to shoot skits starring his brother and sisters. He graduated from A&M; Consolidated High School. Pennell then attended the University of Texas at Austin majoring in Radio-Television-Film but dropped out in 1973 during his junior year to do film work.Alison Macor. Chainsaws, Slackers, and Spy Kids 30 Years of Filmmaking in Austin, Texas University of Texas Press: Austin, 2010. His first job was with a firm that produced highlight films of Southwest Conference football games. In his spare time, he used the company's equipment to work on his own projects. He changed his name while in his early twenties. His first name is supposedly based on the story that Pennell was once told his large nose looked like the beak of an eagle. His last name comes from 2nd Lt. Ross Pennell, a character from John Ford's She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949). Ford was one of his father's favorite directors.  Career  Pennell's first film, a short documentary titled Rodeo Cowboys, chronicled a rodeo school near Lake Travis outside of Austin. He co- organized Austin's first film festival in April 1975. He made his first narrative short, A Hell of a Note, in 1977. The short inspired his most notable film, The Whole Shootin' Match. He enlisted the help of Austin writer Lin Sutherland to get it written and produced. It is a tale of two lifelong friends, and would-be entrepreneurs, chasing one get-rich-quick scheme after another. The Whole Shootin' Match won seven awards and inspired Robert Redford to start Sundance. In the early 1980s, Pennell moved to Houston, where he produced and directed his second feature film Last Night at the Alamo (1984). The story, co-written with screenwriter Kim Henkel, follows a group of friends gathering at a soon-to-be-demolished bar for the last time. The movie was well received, garnering praise at the New York Film Festival and the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado. Film critics Vincent Canby, Stanley Kauffmann and Roger Ebert also gave the movie rave reviews. In 1989, Pennell directed Ice House, starring Melissa Gilbert, for Upfront Films. With grant money, Pennell completed two more independent projects during the 1990s, Heart Full of Soul and Doc's Full Service (his final film), which had its world premi√®re at the SXSW Film Festival in 1994. Both films are regarded as failures. At the time of his death, Pennell had a grant from the Independent Television Service to develop a script based on his treatment My Dog Bit Elvis.  Personal life  Pennell struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction for much of his adult life. For years before his death, he was intermittently homeless and often borrowed or begged for money.Daniel Stuyck. \\"THE DEFIANT DEFEATIST: The loser lore of the late Eagle Pennell, proto-indie misfit from the Lone Star State\\" Film Society of Lincoln Center.

Directed by Claire Huie and Ren√© Pinnell (Pennell's nephew), the film was scored by Pennell's brother, Chuck. The documentary tells the story of Pennell's rise, fall, and tragic death, through interviews with family, friends, collaborators, and admirers. The original King of Texas was a film Pennell wanted to make - a low-budget Western he planned to shoot near Brackettville on the set of John Wayne's version of The Alamo (1960).

It was one of three Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) posts set up in Russian America. The Fort Durham Site was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1978. Background In 1834 the HBC tried to establish a post on the Stikine River, British rights to which had been one of the terms of the Russo-British Treaty of 1825. However, the effort was blocked by employees of the Russian American Company (RAC), on the orders of Governor Ferdinand von Wrangel. Several years were spent by the HBC attempting to seek financial compensation from the RAC in response to be being blocked access from the Stikine River. Late in 1838 the Imperial Russian Government ordered the RAC to settle their dispute with HBC, eventually leading to the signing of the RAC-HBC Agreement in early 1839. One of the main terms was a ten-year lease of what is today the Alaska Panhandle. The HBC was guaranteed the right to establish posts, hunt, and trade furs along the coast in exchange for furnishing Russian America with provisions and various food supplies. Creation Taking advantage of the agreement's terms immediately, the HBC sent James Douglas north in the Beaver in 1840. Douglas explored the Taku River and built Fort Durham (or Taku) on the coast just south of the river's mouth. He also took possession of Redoubt San Dionisio (Fort Saint Dionysius), which lay off the mouth of the Stikine River on Etolin Island, near today's Wrangell, Alaska (and renamed it Fort Stikine), which the Russians had agreed to transfer to the HBC under the 1839 lease agreement. Closure In 1841 the HBC governor George Simpson ordered Fort Durham and other coastal posts closed, because the Beaver was able to conduct the coastal fur trade without the need for more than the single permanent post of Fort Simpson. The HBC closed operations at Fort Durham in 1843.Mackie (1997), 142, 269‚Äì270. The majority of the 8 Hawaiian Kanakas employees at Fort Durham were reassigned to Fort Victoria.Koppel, Tom.

After publicly exposing Nazi propaganda and fifth column activity, he was obliged to slip out of Germany in April 1939. In the early days of World War II, he joined Section D. He was a leading figure in Britain's propaganda campaign, including attempts to convince German soldiers of a failed German landing attempt along the south coast of England.Baker White, 1955 The job of Baker White and of his handful of co-workers was to cook up stories to be fed to the enemy and give him a quite false impression of the state of Britain's defences.

Sent to the University of Leuven immediately after his ordination to the priesthood (1854), he soon became head librarian of the university (1859‚Äì1896). He collaborated with his rector, Pierre Fran√ßois Xavier de Ram, in his works on the religious history of Belgium, and in 1864 they founded the review, Analectes pour servir √† l'histoire eccl√©siastique de la Belgique, which Reusens continued to direct until his death. With the same teacher, he became interested in the history of the University of Leuven, to which he devoted almost exclusively the last years of his life. Through his historical studies he acquired a knowledge of palaeography and diplomatics and became professor of a course in these branches (1881‚Äì1903) which was the first of its kind in Belgium. In 1900 he was appointed member of the Royal Commission of History (Brussels). After teaching theology for two years he had charge of a new course in Christian archaeology from 1864-1900. In this department he soon acquired great distinction, as is evidenced by the success of his manual, his appointment (1884) to the Royal Commission of Monuments (Brussels), his participation in the exposition of ancient art, and his role in the renovation of religious art in Belgium. His principal works are: El√©ments d'arch√©ologie chr√©tienne (Leuven, 1871-5); El√©ments de pal√©ographie (Leuven, 1899); Documents relatifs √† l'histoire de l'universit√© de Leuven (Leuven, 1881‚Äì1903).

It consists of Fort Glenn, an airfield of the United States Army Air Corps later renamed Cape Air Force Base, and the adjacent Naval Air Facility Otter Point, both located on Umnak Island in the Aleutian Islands of southwestern Alaska. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. History = Origins = Because of the perceived vulnerability of Alaska immediately following the Pearl Harbor Attack, additional Army Air Corps units were authorized by General Henry H. Arnold for Alaska and plans were made to send modern aircraft to the Territory to replace the obsolete aircraft assigned. However the Alaskan Air Force had few airfields to accommodate the additional aircraft and units being assigned.Chloe, John Hale, (1984), Top Cover for America. the Air Force in Alaska. 1920‚Äì1983, Pictorial Histories Publishing Company, Along with new airfields on the mainland and Southwest Alaska, new air bases were planned for the air defense of the Aleutians to Dutch Harbor. Construction of the new bases on Umnak and Cold Bay began in January 1942 in secret, with construction reportedly disguised as a cannery. The first United States Army engineers landed at what would become Fort Glenn Army Air Base on 17 January and construction began by the end of the month. A Naval airfield, Otter Point Naval Air Facility was adjacent to the Army Airbase. The 807th Engineering Battalion (Aviation) was brought in from Yukat to perform the construction along with a detachment of the Navy Seabee 8th Construction Battalion. Personnel tents at Fort Glenn AAB, May 1942 Plans called for three hard-surfaced runways (four were eventually built), however time was of the essence in the construction of the base, as the air defense of Dutch Harbor was dependent on them. Instead of a hard surface, engineers chose to use a new material, Pierced Steel Planking (PSP), which could be laid down quickly over a compressed gravel subsurface to provide the airfield with an all-weather capability. There were 80,000 pieces of matting which needed to be barged to the island. Construction crews worked in three shifts, 24 hours a day laying down the runways and constructing a rudimentary support station, water and sewer lines, an electrical grid, communications, fuel and munitions storage sites and all the other necessities to convert a remote island site into an operational airfield capable of supporting heavy bombers. A 5,000' PSP runway was completed on 5 April although a C-53 was first plane to land on the field was on 31 March. The main runway was officially opened on 23 May.AFHRA Document 00001959 Fort Glenn's first runway was then the U.S. Army's most westerly airfield in the Aleutian Islands.\\" The first operational unit, the 11th Fighter Squadron, moved into Fort Glenn with P-40 Warhawk fighters on 26 May from Elmendorf Field. Additional construction continued throughout 1942 with four 5'000 x 175 foot runways were completed (06/24, 07/35), two of which (03/21, 04/22) were situated only 10 degrees apart. All runways had four layers of asphalt laid down over the PSP. Two additional emergency landing fields were built, one on the north coast of the island (North Shore) , 9.4 miles north; the other 7.7 miles to the west-southwest of the base near the Tullk Volcano (Pacifier) .Fort Glenn Army Airfield / Otter Point Naval Air Facility, Umnak Island, AK Morrison-Knudsen Construction Company built hundreds of Quonset hut structures on the base, replacing the temporary tents which exposed the construction crews to the sudden storms which swept the island frequently. Housing & messing facilities for 119 officers & 359 men were constructed as well as recreational and service buildings. Storage facilities consisted of 6,975 square feet for general stores & a 150-cubic- foot freezer. Buildings for aircraft included a kodiak-type hangar, 160' x 90', a squadron warehouse, and a terminal for air transport service. Administration offices were housed in 5 buildings with a total floor space of 3,850 square feet. Radio facilities included a transmitting station, a direction-finder station, and a radar station, all with separate power houses & with housing & messing provisions for personnel. The hospital, located in one small building, contained 8 beds. The maintenance force of the station was installed in 7 buildings. Electric power was provided by 3 diesel-electric generators. =Aleutian Islands Campaign= 11th Fighter Squadron P-40 Warhawks at Fort Glenn AAB, June 1942. On 3 June 1942 the Imperial Japanese Navy launched two aircraft carrier raids on the United States Army barracks and the US Navy base at Dutch Harbor on nearby Amaknak Island. The attack was a surprise, however the base been on alert for an attack for many days, although there was no specific warning of the attack before the Japanese planes arrived over Dutch Harbor. The attack signaled the beginning of the Aleutian Islands Campaign. In response, the P-40s of the 11th Fighter Squadron from Fort Glenn AAB along with Naval land-based fighters attacked the Japanese aircraft. Eleventh Air Force also dispatched aircraft from Elmendorf Field. In the ensuring battle, the United States Navy lost four PBYs, and Eleventh AF lost one B-17, two B-26s and one LB-30 (B-24A) bombers and two P-40 fighters. The Japanese lost two A6M \\"Zero\\" fighters, and possibly a third due to ground anti-aircraft fire. One A6M \\"Zero\\", three D3A \\"Val\\" dive bombers and one E8N \\"Dave\\"reconnaissance seaplane were shot down in aerial combat. Eleventh Air Force also dispatched B-26 Marauder medium bombers of the 77th Bombardment Squadron. They arrived about noon to locate the Japanese aircraft carriers and counterattack, however they landed at Fort Glenn about 1:30pm due to fog and low visibility. The Marauders were carrying airborne torpedoes, rather than contact bombs which they were designed to carry. In addition to the Dutch Harbor attack, Japanese forces landed on Kiska Island on 6 June; Attu Island on 7 June, seizing both. The Japanese attacks on Dutch Harbor, however inflicted only minor damage on the base, which were quickly repaired. The mission of Fort Glenn Army Air Base was changed to serve as the initial forward base to launch bombing attacks against the Japanese forces in the Aleutians. Known Air Force units deployed to Fort Glenn were: * 28th Bombardment Group : 21st Bombardment Squadron, LB-30 Liberator :: Assigned to Hamilton Field, California, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 11 June 1942 :: Assigned to Fort Glenn AAB, 3 September 1942-19 September 1943 : 36th Bombardment Squadron, B-17E Flying Fortress, LB-30 Liberator :: Assigned to Elmendorf Field, Alaska Territory, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 4 June 1942-1 May 1943 : 73d Bombardment Squadron, B-25 Mitchell :: Assigned to Elmendorf Field, Alaska Territory, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning June 1942 :: Assigned to Fort Glenn AAB, April‚ÄìJune 1943 : 77th Bombardment Squadron, B-25 Mitchell, B-26 Marauder :: Assigned to Elmendorf Field, Alaska Territory, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 30 May-3 October 1942 : 404th Bombardment Squadron, B-24 Liberator :: Assigned to Will Rogers Field, Oklahoma, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 24 August-13 September 1942 * 343d Fighter Group : 11th Fighter Squadron, P-40 Warhawk :: Assigned to Elmendorf Field, Alaska Territory, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 26 May‚ÄìJune 1942 :: Assigned to Fort Glenn AAB, June 1942-20 February 1943 : 54th Fighter Squadron, P-40 Warhawk :: Assigned to Elmendorf Field, Alaska Territory, TDY to Fort Glenn AAB beginning 6 June-19 September 1942 : 344th Fighter Squadron, P-40 Warhawk :: Assigned to Fort Glenn AAB, 8 March-23 May 1943 36th Bombardment Squadron LB-30 Liberator and a Boeing B-17E Fortress (41-9126) at Fort Glenn AAB, June 1942. By the close of 1942, Fort Glenn AAB had 10,579 personnel assigned, but its role as an advance air base had been supplanted by new air bases on Adak and Amchitka Islands in early 1943 farther to the west. By the end of the year, the base had become a backwater; its mission had become the provision of housing and rations for transient personnel and the servicing of transient aircraft. =Closure= After the war ended, Fort Glenn remained open as a refueling stop for transient aircraft in the Aleutians along with Military Air Transport Service flights using the Great Circle Route from Japan to the United States. The main runway, however was extended to 8,300' to accommodate large, long range aircraft. By 1946, the base was manned only by skeleton staff due to the rapid demobilization of the Air Force. The last Air Force personnel were withdrawn by 30 September 1947, and the base was put on inactive status and was effectively abandoned.AFHRA Document 00001996 It was decommissioned in 1950 and the site was excessed between 1952-55 to the Bureau of Land Management. The land was later transferred to a variety of owners, including Alaska Native corporations and the State of Alaska. Today hundreds of buildings, runways, and World War II artillery emplacements remain in various states of deterioration. Today Fort Glenn AAF is a virtual ghost town‚Äîexcept for a family of cattle ranchers who have renovated several World War II buildings and who call the base home. The expanse and undisturbed quality of the resource make Fort Glenn AAF an outstanding conceptual model for landscape preservation. In 1991, National Park Service historians visited the site to review the World War II-related construction, infrastructure, landscape, and objects. It was determined that any environmental cleanup should be designed to remove loose cables, transformers, hazardous material, toxic waste, and ordnance.

Its antithesis is the tabula rasa hypothesis, which posits that all species have immigrated into completely denuded land after the retreat of glaciers. By the mid-20th Century, the nunatak hypothesis was widely accepted among biologists working on the floras of Greenland and Scandinavia. However, while modern geology has established the presence of ice-free areas during the last glacial maximum in both Greenland and Scandinavia, molecular techniques have revealed limited between-region genetic differentiation in many Arctic taxa, strongly suggesting a general capacity for long-distance dispersal among polar organisms. This does not directly disprove glacial survival. But it makes it less necessary as an explanation. Moreover, populations that survived on icefree land have probably in most cases been genetically flooded by postglacial immigrants.

The game was designed by Franz-Benno Delonge and Thomas Ewert. The game is themed around the shipping industry, and the primary pieces in the game are shipping containers. The players produce, buy, sell, ship and store containers with the general goal of maximizing overall profits. Economic considerations such as supply and demand, cash management, return on investment and efficient use of resources are natural consequences of the game's buying and selling rules. Gameplay Each player owns a shipyard with an attached production facility for goods, as well as a ship that can be used to transport goods. The game uses five kinds of (unnamed, but colour-coded) goods, which are represented as a miniature intermodal container (shipping container). Each player's ship can carry up to five containers. Initially each player has the means to produce one container in a single action; actions may be used to expand the player's production capacity (which also costs money). At the time of production, the player pays the player to his right a union contribution, and must place his newly produced goods in his factory store priced at between 1 and 4 currency units. Once containers are produced, another player‚Äînot the same player‚Äîmay use an action during his turn to buy some or all of the containers, placing them on his dockside store priced as he chooses at between 2 and 6 currency units. Players can initially only keep one container in their dockside store, and must spend actions (and money) to buy more warehouses to increase their capacity. Each player's ship begins the game in the open sea. A player can use an action to move his ship between the open sea and another player's (but not his own) dockyard; when he arrives in another player's dockyard he may buy some or all of that player's containers. A player can also use an action to move his ship between the open sea and a small, industrialising island that the shipping companies hope to make money from. When he arrives at the island, a blind auction takes place between the other players; the player who triggered the auction chooses whether to sell the goods to the highest-bidding player (at which point he also receives the same amount from the bank as a government subsidy, and the buying player places the containers in his own space on the island) or buy the goods for himself at the highest bid, at which point he places the containers in his own space on the island. Thus there is a difference of three times the highest bid in allowing the containers to go to another player instead of taking them for onesself! The game ends at the end of a player's turn when the pre-determined supply of containers runs out of two types. At this point, the containers on the island are evaluated. Each player is dealt, at the start of the game, a card telling him the values (to him) of each of the different types of containers, from 2 to 10. However, the type of container that he has most of (or one of the types of containers that he has joint most of) is deemed to be oversupplied, and hence worthless‚Äîcreating a situation whereby he wishes to have the most, or joint most, of his least valuable container. There is also a mechanism by which a player benefits from having at least one of each type of container in his space on the island. Containers remaining on players' ships or in their dockside stores, but not in their factory stores, are also worth money at game end. The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner. The game encourages players to compete economically. The convoluted route that the containers take to their eventual destination means that players can lose track of whose production facility an individual container originally came from, and focus only on its immediate and future value to them.

Burial of Correa de Araujo in the Cathedral of Segovia. Francisco Correa de Araujo (or Arauxo, or Acebedo) (1584-1654) was a Spanish organist, composer, and theorist of the late Renaissance. Life Correa de Araujo was born in Seville. Like most Spanish organists from this era, details of his life are clouded by obscurity. For some time even the years of his birth and death were disputed.The dates given here are those given by Ayarra and the New Grove and are regarded as authoritative; but the reader should be aware that earlier sources, even authoritative ones such as Apel's textbook on early music, may have differing dates for Correa's birth and death which are now regarded as incorrect. His musical background is unclear; he claimed to have learned theory by studying the works of Francisco de Peraza and Diego del Castillo. In 1599 he received an organ appointment in Seville, but became embroiled in a lawsuit with rival Juan Picafort, which delayed confirmation of this appointment for six years. In 1608, he was ordained as a priest. He maintained the post at Seville until 1636. Several times he applied unsuccessfully for other positions, and once again in 1630, he became embroiled in lawsuits which culminated in a brief period of imprisonment. In 1636, he left Seville and took up a post at Ja√©n Cathedral. In 1640, he was appointed as a prebendary at Segovia Cathedral, and remained there for the last fourteen years of his life. He died at Segovia in abject poverty. Works Correa's writings make reference to two other publications (a Libro de versos and a book on music theory), that were not published yet by that time; however, all his surviving works are contained in a single publication entitled Libro de tientos y discursos de m√∫sica practica, y theorica de organo intitulado Facultad organica, published in 1626. This publication serves not only as a book of compositions, but as a treatise on music theory and performance practice, and it is one of the most important works of its kind to emerge from Spain in the 17th century. Correa's compositions take advantage of all the devices available to Spanish organists of the time, most notably the medio registro, or divided keyboard, an innovation unique to the Iberian peninsula which appeared towards the end of the 16th century, while his theoretical writings give great insight into his ideas of harmony and counterpoint. The Libro de tientos contains 69 works, of which 62 are tientos (that is, fantasias), ordered by increasing levels of difficulty - an indication that the purpose behind this work was at least partly pedagogical. By way of contrast with the works of his Portuguese contemporary, Coelho, Correa's works are considerably shorter and show a stronger tendency towards monothematicism. He employs virtuosic figurations (the so-called glosa) in his works to a much greater extent, often at the expense of contrapuntal development; after the initial exposition, restatements of the theme are rare, and thematic development and use of contrapuntal devices such as inversion or augmentation are almost non- existent. Correa's harmonic language, while not devoid of tonally suggestive progressions, is quite distinctly modal and represents a continuation of the idiom established by Cabez√≥n and Aguilera de Heredia. The music of Correa is not devoid of innovation. Correa makes use of many devices unique to Spanish organ music of this period: unusual sonorities such as the augmented triad, unusual rhythmic groupings, and a notable dissonance which he vigorously defends, referred to as punto intenso contra remisso: the simultaneous sounding of a note and its chromatic alteration (e.g., C and C#). The theoretical aspect of this work also discusses ornamentation, notes inegales, registration, and use of the different modes and key signatures. Correa's organ music was inspired by the unique tonal qualities of Spanish organs, unequal temperament, and such devices as the divided keyboard. Modern-day recording technology, coupled with an increased interest in studying ancient organs and building newer instruments to replicate them, has made these works more readily accessible to both performer and listener. A complete edition of Correa's works has been compiled by Macario Santiago Kastner and released by Masters Music Publications. Recordings *Francisco Correa de Araujo: Facultad organica.

Seward, also known as Chilkoot Barracks and Haines Mission, is a site at Port Chilkoot in Haines Borough, Alaska, about from the city of Haines. It was the last of a series of 11 military posts established in Alaska during the gold rush era, and was Alaska's only military facility between 1925 and 1940. It provided a policing presence for miners moving into the gold mining areas in the Alaskan interior, and a military presence during negotiations over the nearby international border with Canada. The fort is named for William H. Seward, the United States Secretary of State who oversaw the Alaska purchase. History Street-level view of the fort. The fort was formally authorized by an executive order of President William McKinley in December 1898. United States Army troops had been stationed unofficially in the area during that year. Between 1902 and 1904, a formal infantry outpost consisting of 85 wood-frame buildings was constructed under the supervision of Colonel W. P. Richardson, and was formally named in 1904. It was first occupied by three companies of the Third Infantry, previously stationed at Camp Skagway. By 1909 the fort had grown to cover more than . It was formally renamed Chilkoot Barracks in 1922, honoring the local Chilkoot people and the Chilkoot Trail used during the gold rush. Between 1921 and 1925 all other military installations in Alaska were shut down; in 1927 Fort Seward was manned by a force of 255. The fort was formally deactivated in 1945, and sold to the Port Chilkoot Company. The property has been developed as an art colony; it includes housing and art galleries, and accommodations for tourists. The fort was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1978. and Demographics Fort William H. Seward first appeared separately on the 1910 U.S. Census and in 1920. Its name was changed to Chilkoot Barracks in 1930 and 1940, before its closure in 1945.

Therefore, the trade union official had never threatened a breach of contract because the contracts began afresh with a new day's work. Judgment =High Court= Kennedy J presided over the trial where the jury found that the plaintiffs had suffered damage to the extent of ¬£20 each, and assessed the damage accordingly. =Court of Appeal= Lord Esher MR, Lopes LJ and Rigby LJ held that the action was maintainable against the district delegate.[1895] 2 QB 21 =House of Lords= The House of Lords held by a majority (Lord Watson, Lord Herschell, Lord Macnaghten, Lord Shand, Lord Davey, and Lord James) that even though there was a malicious motive, this could not render the conduct unlawful, because the effect actually complained of (not rehiring) was in itself entirely lawful. As one of those invited to give an opinion, Cave J said the following. Giving the last judgment, Lord Davey said the following.[1898] 1 AC 1, 171-2 Lord Halsbury LC, Lord Ashbourne and Lord Morris dissented. Significance Allen v Flood has come under criticism in some quarters. In another leading tort case in the context of union strike action, Rookes v Barnard,[1964] AC 1129, [1964] 1 All ER 367 Lord Devlin expressed disapproval.see also, Patrick Devlin, Samples of Law-Making (1962) 10-13. However Allen v. Flood was approved by the House of Lords in the recent case of OBG v Allan.[2008] 1 AC 1, [2007] UKHL 21. Allen v Flood also held that the earlier economic tort case of Keeble v Hickeringill was just a nuisance case, and not an economic torts case.

Dancing career Frances Lee was born Merna Phyllis Tibbetts to William George and Nellie (n√©e Leach) Tibbetts in Eagle Grove, Iowa. She initially began pursuing a career as a teacher but began taking dance lessons, which led to her being spotted by Gus Edwards, who owned a theater in New York City. Edwards persuaded Lee to perform at his theater, and she joined the cast of The Ziegfeld Follies in 1923, when she was hired by Al Christie to perform in his Christie Comedies. Later that year, cover artist Neysa McMein chose her as one the best of six different types of beauties. Silent film career Moving to Hollywood in the mid-1920s to pursue acting, Lee received her first film role in 1924, starring in Hello and Goodbye, a comedy short film. That brought her to the attention of the studios and launched her into a very successful and busy silent film career. In 1925, Lee had roles in three films, and in 1926 her number of films jumped to seven. Lee was a frequent guest at the home of Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks and became friends with other notable Hollywood legends, to include Rudolph Valentino until his death in 1926. In 1927 she had roles in five films and was selected as one of thirteen girls to be WAMPAS Baby Stars, which that year included silent film star Sally Phipps and actress Barbara Kent. The year 1928 was a big year for Lee, as she starred in nine films, the most memorable of which was Sweeties with Bobby Vernon. Her biggest year by far was 1929, when she starred in ten films, including the lead role in Stage Struck Susie opposite Eddie Barry and Divorce Made Easy starring alongside Marie Prevost and Douglas MacLean. In 1934, she married Alexander Bennett, brother to Australian silent film actress Enid Bennett. Their wedding was attended by such Hollywood legends as Enid Bennett's husband, film producer Fred Niblo; actresses Gloria Swanson and Greta Garbo; and actors Rod La Rocque and John Gilbert.Frances Lee obituary Transition to \\"talking films\\" and later life Lee made a semisuccessful transition to \\"talking films\\", while the majority of silent film stars did not. Her first film in 1930 was Down with Husbands followed by The Stronger Sex, starring Carmel Myers. However, Lee's career had slowed considerably from the silent film years, and from 1931 to 1935 she had roles in only seven films. Lee auditioned for the female lead role in King Kong and was one of two actresses finally considered for the role, losing it ultimately to Fay Wray. Later years Lee retired from film acting after 1935, living with her husband in Beverly Hills, California. She began working in interior design and studied for and received a degree in teaching. Lee and her husband lived in Brentwood, where she began one of the early Head Start programs at Knox Presbyterian Nursery School. She also taught dance, society behavior, and etiquette at the Elisa Ryan Studio, where she instructed the daughters of President Richard M. Nixon. In 1972, Lee and Alex moved to Cardiff-by-the-Sea. She worked as a children's librarian at the Rancho Sante Fe Library until only a few years before her death. Lee died on November 5, 2000, in Cardiff-by-the-Sea, California, aged 94.

Lea was born to Thomas Lea (1757-1794) and Sarah Tatnall (eldest daughter of Joseph Tatnall) in a house at 1901 Market Street in Wilmington. He was a descendant of John Lea, a prominent Quaker minister from England, who came to America with William Penn on his second voyage. He was the father of Preston Lea, Governor of Delaware from 1905 to 1908. The William Lea house, 1901 N. Market Street in Wilmington. Photo by Willard Stewart in the 1930s Lea was first employed with his father in the firm of Tatnall and Lea, founded in the 1760s on the north bank on the Brandywine Creek by his father and grandfather, and then at Manayunk, Pennsylvania; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Terre Haute, Indiana. He was married to Jane Scott Lovett on the October 18, 1836. He returned to his old home in Wilmington in 1837 and became one of the proprietors of the Brandywine Mills. The couple had 11 children together, William (b. 1834), Esther (b. 1837), Henry (b. 1839), Preston (b. 1841), Mary (b. 1846), Sarah (1848-1848), Anna (b. 1849), Edward (1852-1867), Alice (1854-1857), Thomas (1856-1859), and Jane (b. 1860). In 1864, the firm was renamed William Lea and Sons when Lea brought his sons, Henry and Preston, into the business. Brandywine Flour Mills in an 1840 painting by Bass Otis Besides operating the flour mills, Lea was for many years a director in the Union National Bank of Wilmington, and was also a director in the Wilmington and Brandywine Cemetery Company. He was greatly interested in the improvement of Brandywine Village, in which he lived, and favored its annexation to the city of Wilmington as the Ninth Ward. The Superfine Lane Condominiums (named for the grade of flour produced by the Quaker millers) were built in 1984 and incorporated the foundations of the old William Lea and Sons flour mills, which continued to operate 1923.

Built 1829-30, it is prominent local example of a Federal style church with Gothic Revival features. On September 3, 1976, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Architecture and history St. John's Episcopal Church stands on the east side of the village green in Highgate Falls, near the southern end of the elongated green. It is a single- story brick building, with a gabled roof. The front facade is three bays wide, with Gothic-arched windows flanking a central projecting gabled entry. The double-door entrance is topped by a fanlight, and there is a Palladian window with an arched center above. In the gable of the projection is a Federal style louvered fan. A square tower rises, set astride the boundary between the main roof and the projection. It has a round panel in the first stage, and the second stage is an octagonal louvered belfry. with The church was built between 1829 and 1830 by Joel Whitney of Enosburg, and was consecrated on May 21, 1834, by the Rt. Rev. John Henry Hopkins, the first bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont. Its design is similar to a plan found in Asher Benjamin's The Country Builder's Assistant, a design book of Federal architecture, but it has been modified with Gothic features. The congregation was a full parish until 1896. Since then it has been under the jurisdiction of Holy Trinity Episcopal Church, Swanton, whose current rector is the Rev. John R. Spainhour.

It has a population of about 1,100. It lies in the Silesian Foothills in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. The name is patronymic in origin derived from personal name Ba≈ºan.  History  It was first mentioned in a written document in 1523 as Bazanowicze. Politically it belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Cieszyn. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 361 in 1880 to 522 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish-speakers (between 94.8% and 98.5%) accompanied by a small German-speaking minority (at most 27 or 5.2% in 1910). In terms of religion in 1910 majority were Protestants (73%), followed by Roman Catholics (25.8%) and Jews (6 people). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. In 1930 a dairy was founded in the village, it operates to date producing emmentaler and other milk products. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.  People  Pawe≈Ç Stalmach, Polish journalist and Protestant activist was born here.

He was born in the village of Denysiw, near Ternopil, Ukraine. He came to Canada at age one in 1910 with his parents, who homesteaded near Delph, Alberta, north of Vegreville. Education Hlynka finished his elementary schooling in a one-room school house, which was located in a corner of his father's farm. He attended high school in Edmonton. He received Bachelor's and Master's degrees in chemistry from the University of Alberta. He then attended the California Institute of Technology and received his PhD in biochemistry in 1939. Career Hlynka worked in Ottawa, Ontario from 1939 to 1947. In 1947, Dr. Hlynka took a position at the Grain Research Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba where he lived for the rest of his life. He published over a hundred refereed journal papers, mainly on biochemistry applied to wheat, and bread quality. For his research, he was the first winner of the Brabender Award (1967) for the application of rheology in milling and baking, and was a winner of the Osborne Gold Medal in Cereal Chemistry (1976). The American Association of Cereal Chemists, Rheology Section, in which Dr. Hlynka was active, named the Isydore Hlynka Best Student Paper Award in his honor. While at the Grain Research Laboratory in Winnipeg, he supervised postdoctoral students and visiting scientists from many countries, including Japan, the United Kingdom, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and the Netherlands. He was the editor/author of one book on cereal chemistry, entitled \\"Wheat, Chemistry and Technology.\\" For years, this book was a standard reference (and was translated into the Russian language and used in the Soviet Union). Dr. Hlynka was active in the Ukrainian Canadian community. His brother, Anthony Hlynka, was the second Member of Parliament of Ukrainian ancestry in the House of Commons of Canada (Vegreville, 1940‚Äì1949). Dr. Hlynka wrote many of the commentaries which appeared in the Ukrainian Canadian Committee national bulletin in the 1950s. Dr. Hlynka was a pioneer in the concept of multiculturalism in Canada. In 1963, he wrote and presented the Ukrainian Canadian Committee's submission to the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism in Ottawa. His submission was the first of any non-British, non-French ethnic group. Dr. Hlynka argued that Canada was in fact multilingual and multicultural, with two main working languages - Quebec's working language being mainly French, and the rest of Canada having English as a working language. His presentation received major news coverage across Canada and set the tone for all other ethnic groups to follow. In succeeding years, Dr. Hlynka wrote many articles and gave many speeches on the subject of multiculturalism. From 1971-1983, he wrote a weekly English language newspaper column for Winnipeg-based Ukrainsky Holos (The Ukrainian Voice), with the title \\"Behind the Official Languages Curtain\\", under the pseudonym Ivan Harmata. Selections from that column were published in book form with the title \\"The Other Canadians.\\" Simultaneously with the newspaper column, Dr. Hlynka had a Ukrainian language weekly commentary on radio station CKJS in Winnipeg, on the same topics. Dr. Hlynka was the founding president of the Ukrainian Canadian Foundation of Taras Shevchenko. From its inception in 1963, he was president for its first fifteen years. Dr. Hlynka was an executive member of the Board of Directors of St. Andrew's College (Winnipeg). He was an executive member of the National Presidium of Ukrainian Canadian Committee. He was active with the Ukrainian Cultural and Educational Centre in Winnipeg and with the Ukrainian Canadian Professional and Business Association.

Facts Douglas Rookes was a draughtsman, employed by British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). He resigned from his union, the Association of Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsman (AESD), after a disagreement. BOAC and AESD had a closed shop agreement, and AESD threatened a strike unless Rookes resigned also from his job or was fired. BOAC suspended Rookes and, after some months, dismissed him with one week's salary in lieu of proper notice. Rookes sued the union officials, including Mr Barnard, the branch chairman (also the divisional organiser Mr Silverthorne and the shop steward Mr Fistal). Rookes said that he was the victim of a tortious intimidation that had used unlawful means to induce BOAC to terminate his contract. The strike was alleged to be the unlawful means. Judgment At first instance, before Sachs J, the action succeeded. This was overturned in the Court of Appeal. The House of Lords reversed the court of appeal, finding in favour of Rookes and against the union. Citing a case from the eighteenth century called Tarelton v M'Gawley (1793) Peake 270 where a ship fired a cannonball across the bows of another, Lord Reid said the union was guilty of the tort of intimidation. It was unlawful intimidation \\"to use a threat to break their contracts with their employer as a weapon to make him do something which he was legally entitled to do but which they knew would cause loss to the plaintiff\\".Rookes v Barnard [1964] AC 1129, 1167 A corollary to the main issue in the case, but of greater lasting importance, was Lord Devlin's pronouncements on when punitive damages are applied. The only three situations in which damages are allowed to be punitive, i.e. with the purpose of punishing the wrongdoer rather than aiming simply to compensate the claimant, are in cases of, #Oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional actions by the servants of government. #Where the defendant's conduct was \\"calculated\\" to make a profit for himself. #Where a statute expressly authorises the same. This aspect of Rookes v Barnard has not been followed in Canada, New Zealand or Australia.See Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Uren (1967) 117 CLR 221, where the Privy Council upheld the Australian rejection of Rookes v Barnard In Broome v Cassell, Lord Denning in the Court of Appeal called Lord Devlin's approach \\"unworkable\\" and suggested it was decided per incuriam. He was strongly criticised in the House of Lords, which upheld Rookes v Barnard. Significance The case was met with immediate outrage for creating, or reviving, economic torts as a weapon to undermine the right to strike. It was reversed by the Trade Disputes Act 1965.

It has a population of about 600. The village lies in the Silesian Foothills, in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia.  History  The village was first mentioned in 1445 as na mezy Godyessowsske. Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re- established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielsko and the legal district of Skocz√≥w. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 412 in 1880 to 525 in 1910, with majority of the inhabitants being native Polish-speakers (96.6%-99.8%) and a few people German-speaking (most 15 or 2.9% in 1910) and Czech-speaking (most 9 or 2.2% in 1890), mostly Protestants (87.7% in 1910), followed by Roman Catholics (11.2% in 1910) and Jews (6 people). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.

(ed.) (2006). The Delhi Sultanate, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, pp.215-20 was an independent late medieval Sultan of Bengal, who founded the Hussain Shahi dynasty. He became the ruler of Bengal after assassinating the Abyssinian Sultan, Shams- ud-Din Muzaffar Shah, whom he had served under as wazir. After his death in 1519 his son Nusrat Shah succeeded him. Early life and accession Husain Shah's original name is Sayyeed Husain. According to a 1788 chronicle, Riyaz- us-Salatin, Husain was the son of Sayyeed Ashraf Al Husaini Al Fatimi Al Makki, a Sharif of Mecca and an inhabitant of Tirmiz (in Turkestan). Besides both historians Salim (writer of Riyaz-us-Salatin) and Firishtah (from late 16th century) mentioned him as Sayyed - this indicates Husain's Arab descent. Besides, the term Sultan Husain Shah bin Sayyeed Ashraf-ul-Husaini (Sultan Husain Shah, son of Sayyed Ashraf-ul-Husaini) frequently appeared on his coins. But it is not yet known how he came to Bengal and occupied the post of Vizier of Sultan Shamsuddin Muzaffar Shah. Most likely he first settled in Chandpara, a village in Murshidabad district. Because a number of inscriptions of Husain Shah's early years found in the villages around Chandpara and also a mosque called Kherur Mosque is constructed by Sultan Husain in the locality in 1494. A lake, Sheker Dighi, is also associated with Husain Shah. Initially, he secretly sympathized with the rebels but ultimately he put himself openly as their head and besieged the citadel, where Muzaffar Shah shut himself with a few thousand soldiers. According to the 16th-century historian Nizamuddin, the Sultan was secretly assassinated by Husain with the help of the paiks (palace- guards), which ended the Abyssinian rule in Bengal. Reign Husain Shah's long reign of more than a quarter of a century was a period of peace and prosperity, which was strikingly contrast to the period that preceded it. The liberal attitude of Husain Shah towards his Hindu subjects is also an important feature of his reign. =Initial administrative actions= Immediately after accession to the throne, Husain Shah ordered his soldiers to refrain from plundering Gaur, his capital city. But being annoyed with their continuous plundering, he executed twelve thousand soldiers and recovered the looted articles, which included 13,000 gold plates. Subsequently, he disbanded the paiks (the palace guards) who were the most significant agitators inside the palace. He removed all Habshis from administrative posts and replaced them with Turks, Arabs, Afghans and the local people. =Engagement with the Delhi Sultanate= Sultan Hussain Shah Sharqi, after being defeated by Bahlol Lodi, retired to Bihar, where his occupation was confined to a small territory. In 1494, he was again defeated by Sultan Sikandar Lodi and fled to Bengal, where he was granted asylum by Sultan Ala-ud-Din Husain Shah.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2006). The Delhi Sultanate, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, pp.143, 192 This resulted in an expedition against Bengal in 1495 by Sultan Sikandar Lodi. Husain Shah of Bengal sent an army under his son Daniyal to fight with the Delhi army. The armies of Delhi and Bengal met at Barh near Patna. Sikandar Lodi halted the advance of his army and concluded a treaty of friendship with Ala-ud-din Husain Shah. According to this agreement, the country west of Barh went to Sikandar Lodi while the country east of Barh remained under Husain Shah of Bengal. The final dissolution of the Jaunpur Sultanate resulted in the influx of the Jaunpur soldiery in the Bengal army, which was further strengthened by it. =Kamata-Kamrup expedition= From 1499 to 1502, Husain Shah's general Shah Ismail Ghazi led an expedition to the Kamata kingdom and annexed the territory up to Hajo. They took Nilambara, King of Kamata, as prisoner and pillaged the capital city. This was publicly recorded in an inscription at Malda. =Orissa campaigns= According to the Madala Panji, Shah Ismail Ghazi commenced his campaign from the Mandaran fort (in the present-day Hooghly district) in 1508-9 and reached Puri, raiding Jajpur and Katak on the way. The Gajapati ruler of Orissa, Prataparudra was busy in a campaign in the south. On hearing this news, he returned and defeated the invading Bengal army and chased it into the borders of Bengal. He reached the Mandaran fort and besieged it, but failed to take it. Intermittent hostilities between the Bengal and Orissa armies along the border continued throughout the reign of Husain Shah. =Capture of Pratapgarh= When Gouhar Khan, the Bengali governor of Sylhet (in present-day Bangladesh) died, the district was seized by ruler of the neighbouring kingdom of Pratapgarh, Sultan Bazid. One of Husain Shah's nobles, a Hindu convert named Surwar Khan was sent to confront Bazid and when attempts at negotiations failed, fought against the Sultan and his allies. Bazid was defeated and captured and was forced to give heavy concessions in order to keep his kingdom, though under the suzerainty of Bengal. In reward for his actions, Surwar Khan was named the new governor of Sylhet and the defeated Sultan's daughter was given in marriage to his son, Mir Khan.* =Expeditions to Tripura and Arakan= According to Rajmala, a late royal chronicle of Tripura, Husain Shah despatched his army four times to Tripura, but the Tripura army offered stiff resistance and did not yield any territory. But the Sonargaon inscription of Khawas Khan (1513) is interpreted by a number of modern scholars as an evidence of annexure of at least a part of Tripura by Husain Shah's army. During Husain Shah's expeditions to Tripura, the ruler of Arakan helped Dhanya Manikya, the ruler of Tripura. He also occupied Chittagong and expelled Husain Shah's officers from there. In 1513, Husain Shah assigned the charge of Arakan expedition to Paragal Khan. Paragal Khan advanced from his base on the Feni River. After Paragal's death, his son Chhuti Khan took over the charge of the campaign until Chittagong was wrested from Arakanese control. The expedition of territory to the western bank of Kaladan river was placed under his governorship administration. The hostilities probably ended in 1516. The Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, arrived India by sea in 1498.KingListsFarEast Consequently, a Portuguese mission came to Bengal to establish diplomatic relations towards the end of Husain Shah's reign. Cultural contribution Choto Shona Mosque built during the reign of Alauddin Husain Shah The reign of Husain Shah witnessed a remarkable development of Bengali literature. Under the patronage of Paragal Khan, Husain Shah's governor of Chittagong, Kabindra Parameshvar wrote his Pandabbijay, a Bengali adaptation of the Mahabharata. Similarly, under the patronage of Paragal's son Chhuti Khan, who succeeded his father as governor of Chittagong, Shrikar Nandi wrote another Bengali adaptation of the Mahabharata. Kabindra Parameshvar in his Pandabbijay eulogised Husain Shah.Sen, Sukumar (1991, reprint 2007). Bangala Sahityer Itihas, Vol.I, , Kolkata: Ananda Publishers, , pp.208-11 Bijay Gupta wrote his Manasamangal KƒÅvya also during his reign. He eulogised Husain Shah by comparing him with Arjuna (samgrame Arjun Raja prabhater Rabi).Sen, Sukumar (1991, reprint 2007). Bangala Sahityer Itihas, Vol.I, , Kolkata: Ananda Publishers, , p.189 He mentioned him as Nrpati-Tilak (the tilak-mark of kings) and Jagat-bhusan (the adornment of the universe) as well. An official of Husain Shah, Yashoraj Khan, wrote a number of Vaishnava padas and he also praised his ruler in one of his pada.Sen, Sukumar (1991, reprint 2007). Bangala Sahityer Itihas, Vol.I, , Kolkata: Ananda Publishers, , p.99 During Husain Shah's reign a number of significant monuments were constructed. Wali Muhammad built Chota Sona Masjid in Gaur.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2006). The Delhi Sultanate, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, p.693 Religious tolerance The reign of Husain Shah is also known for religious tolerance towards his subjects. However, R.C. Majumdar write that during his Orissa campaigns, he destroyed some Hindu temples, which Vrindavana Dasa Thakura has mentioned in his Chaitanya Bhagavata.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2006). The Delhi Sultanate, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, p.634 However the destruction of the temples was not carried out by the orders of the Sultan himself. The celebrated medieval saint, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and his followers preached Bhakti (Nath-Gopi) throughout Bengal during his reign.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2006). The Delhi Sultanate, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, pp.513-4 When Husain Shah came to know about Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's huge following amongst his subjects, he ordered his qazis not to injure him in any way and allow him to go wherever he liked. Later, two high level Hindu officers in Husain Shah's administration, his Private Secretary, (Dabir-i-Khas) Rupa Goswami and his Intimate Minister (Saghir Malik) Sanatana Goswami became devoted followers of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Issue Husain Shah had eighteen sons and at least eleven daughters. Among these are: *Daniyal: likely the eldest son. May have been killed at the end of the campaign on Kamata kingdom. *Nasiruddin Nasrat Shah: succeeded his father. Reigned as Sultan of Bengal from 1519 to 1532. *Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah: reigned as Sultan of Bengal from 1533 to 1538. *Raushan Akhtar Banu: possibly a granddaughter. Married Ibrahim Danishmand, a Sufi saint and landowner. *A daughter: married Kandarpadeva, a son of the Brahmin Madan Bhaduri of Bhaturia. *A daughter: married another son of Madan Bhaduri of Bhaturia.

Background Bred by Edward A. Seltzer, he was purchased for $625,000 at the 1983 Keeneland July Selected Yearling sale by trainer D. Wayne Lukas for his client, Eugene Klein. Klein named the horse after Paul \\"Tank\\" Younger, a former National Football League player and executive with Klein's San Diego Chargers football team. Racing career At age two, Tank's Prospect won his first start, a six-furlong race at California's Santa Anita Park. While he did not win a major race that year, in the inaugural running of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile he finished second to winner Chief's Crown and ahead of third-place finisher Spend A Buck. Racing at age three in 1985, Tank's Prospect won the El Camino Real Derby and Arkansas Derby before running seventh in the Kentucky Derby. He then ran in the Preakness Stakes. Ridden by Pat Day, he caught the favorite, Chief's Crown, close to the finish and won by a head. The winning time of 1:53.4 was, at the time, considered a stakes record, although a commission in 2012 determined that Secretariat is the official record-holder at 1:53.0. In the third leg of the Triple Crown, Tank's Prospect broke down at the top of the stretch in the Belmont Stakes and did not finish the race. The injury ended his racing career. Stud record Retired to stud duty, Tank's Prospect met with modest success. One of his best runners, Real Cash, won the American Derby and San Felipe Stakes.

Key Facts  *MCHB administers Title V MCH Block Grant funding to 59 States and jurisdictions. In fiscal year 2009, State Title V MCH programs served over 39 million individuals. Among the individuals served were 2.5 million pregnant women, 4.1 million infants, 27.6 million children, and 1.9 million children with special health care needs. *Most MCHB funds are sent to states through formula-based block grants, which totaled $551 million in FY 2008. These block grants support vital immunizations and newborn screening tests, along with transportation and case management services that help families access care. States also use block grant funds to develop and implement community-based care systems for children with special health needs and their families. *Additionally, MCHB supports 102 Healthy Start sites in 38 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico that provide community-based outreach, case management, depression screening and educational activities for women in areas with high rates of infant mortality and shortages of health care providers. *MCHB also collects survey data on the physical, behavioral and emotional health of women and children nationwide. In addition, MCHB publishes and disseminates the Women's Health and Child Health USA databooks.  History  The roots of MCHB trace back a century to the 1912 creation of the Children's Bureau within the U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor. The goal of the Children's Bureau was: \\"To serve all children, to try to work out standards of care and protection which shall give to every child fair chance in the world.\\" With the passing of Social Security Act in 1935, the federal government pledged its support of State efforts to extend health and welfare services for mothers and children. This landmark legislation resulted in the establishment of state departments of health or public welfare in some states, and facilitated the efforts of existing agencies in other states. Title V of the Act established Grants to the States for Maternal and Child Welfare. Administration of the Title V grant program was initially assigned to the Children‚Äôs Bureau, giving maternal and child welfare equal status with the unemployment compensation and old-age provisions of the Social Security Act. In 1945, the Children‚Äôs Bureau and five of its six functions were transferred to the Social Security Administration in the Federal Security Agency. The move was intended to simplify the relationship between number grant-in-aid programs and complex intergovernmental efforts related to education, health, welfare and the social security in the Nation. (The Federal Security Agency became the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1953, and the Department of Health and Human Services in 1979.) In 1969, the Children's Bureau was largely broken up, with the maternal and child health and crippled children‚Äôs special projects, training, and research programs moving into the U.S. Public Health Service as the Office for Maternal and Child Health within the Health Services and Mental Health Administration (HSMHA). (The remainder of the Children's Bureau eventually became part of the Administration for Children and Families.) In 1973, upon the breakup of HSMHA, it was moved into the Bureau of Community Health Services of the Health Services Administration. Some of it split off and was absorbed into the Division of Clinical Services until 1982, when the two parts were rejoined into the Division for Maternal and Child Health. The 1980s also saw the most significant change to Title V since its creation - the conversion of Title V to a block grant program as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (OBRA '81). This conversion consolidated seven former Title V categorical child health programs into a single program of formula grants to States supported by a Federal special projects authority (U.S. Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 2012). The 1981 legislation gave States more leeway in determining how to use federal funds (U.S. Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 2001), allowing them to self-direct money to identified, state-specific maternal and child health needs. In 1990, the Maternal and Child Health Division split from the Bureau of Community Health Services to become its own bureau. Seventy-five years after its inception, the Title V MCH program remains the longest lasting federal public health legislation in U.S. history.  Title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant  The largest of MCHB's programs is administration of the Title V Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant Program, the nation's oldest federal-state partnership. A total of 59 States and jurisdictions receive Title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant funding. In fiscal year 2009, State Title V programs served over 39 million individuals. Among the individuals served were 2.5 million pregnant women, 4.1 million infants, 27.6 million children, and 1.9 million children with special health care needs. The Title V MCH Block Grant includes State Formula Block Grants, Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS), and Community Integrated Service Systems (CISS) projects. SPRANS projects support research and training, genetics services and newborn screening, and treatments for sickle cell disease and hemophilia. CISS projects are intended to increase local service delivery capacity and foster comprehensive, integrated, community service systems for mothers and children. State Maternal and Child Health agencies (which are usually located within a State health department) apply for and receive a formula grant each year. In addition to the submission of a yearly application and annual report, State Title V programs are also required to conduct a State-wide, comprehensive Needs Assessment every five years. States and jurisdictions use their Title V funds to design and implement a wide range of MCH and children with special health care needs activities that address national and state needs, including efforts to: reduce infant mortality; provide access to comprehensive prenatal and postnatal care for women; increase the number of children receiving health assessments and follow-up diagnostics and treatment; and provide access to preventive care (including immunizations) and rehabilitative services for children. States must allocate 30% of their funding on children with special health care needs, and 30% on primary and preventive care for children.  MCH Training Program  MCHB funds public and private non-profit institutions of higher learning to provide leadership training in MCH. The aim of the MCH Training Program is to promote quality health services for families through workforce preparation. Workforce preparation must include all segments of the health workforce, provide lifelong opportunities for learning, and address the special needs of women, children and adolescents. Specifically, the MCH Training Program supports: * Trainees who show promise to become leaders in the MCH field through teaching, research, clinical practice, and/or administration and policymaking; * Faculty who mentor students in exemplary MCH public health practice, advance the field through research, develop curricula particular to MCH and public health, and provide technical assistance to those in the field; and, * Continuing education and technical assistance for those already practicing in the MCH field to keep them abreast of the latest research and practices.  Healthy Start Program  Healthy Start is an MCHB initiative mandated to reduce the rate of infant mortality and improve perinatal outcomes through grants to project areas with high annual rates of infant mortality. Healthy Start began in a small area of Oahu, Hawaii in 1985 as a child abuse prevention demonstration project. The demonstration project used paraprofessionals and home visiting in an attempt to help first-time families with their newborn children. This model was adapted and expanded by parenting education programs nationwide. MCHB‚Äôs Healthy Start program began in 1991 with grants to 15 communities with infant mortality rates 1.5 to 2.5 times the national average. In 2010, 104 Healthy Start projects were providing services in 38 States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Healthy Families America offers credentialing, the identification of core elements of the model, and technical assistance to help Healthy Start programs be successful. A recent evaluation of one state's Healthy Start program indicated positive outcomes in parenting skills and decreased parental stress, where low parenting skills and high parental stress were identified by the authors as risk factors for child abuse and maltreatment. It is very difficult to conduct the sort of evaluation project, using control groups, which might isolate the effect of Healthy Start intervention from many other contributing variables on measurable outcomes. However, one recent national evaluation showed that a greater percentage of participants in selected Healthy Start Programs reported breastfeeding and using evidence-based safe sleep practices compared to a comparison group of mothers matched for low income and education.  Other Maternal and Child Health Programs  In addition to the programs described above, MCHB carries out its work through an array of grant programs and initiatives authorized under Title V legislation. One way of categorizing MCHB programs and initiatives is by the primary focus of a particular program‚Äîat the level of individuals and families, the community, or at the state level. In addition, MCHB leads cross-cutting programs and initiatives that support innovative solutions to improve maternal and child health and the quality of health services for MCH populations. Other MCHB initiatives include: * Adolescent and Young Adult Health Program aims to elevate national, state, and community focus on, and commitment to, the health, safety, positive development, and well-being of adolescents, young adults and their families; address the influence of social determinants of health, and eliminate disparities of health, safety and well-being among adolescents and young adults in order to achieve equity.; * Autism and Epilepsy Grants to improve health care and other services for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders and other developmental disabilities by increasing awareness and reducing barriers to screening and diagnosis. * Early Childhood Programs that support federal, state and local agencies to improve the health and well-being of young children and their families by addressing healthy child development within the framework of life course development and a socio- ecological perspective; * Family to Family Health Information Centers which provide grants to family-run organizations to ensure that families have access to adequate information about health and community resources to increase informed decisions around their children's health care; * Traumatic Brain Injury programs that support state efforts to develop an infrastructure capable of responding to and treating traumatic brain injuries; * The Family/Patient Centered Medical Home Program which facilitates the implementation of the family/patient centered medical home model at the practice and system levels to promote the goal that every child and youth, especially those with special health care needs, has access to comprehensive health care that is accessible, family-centered, coordinated, compassionate, and delivered in a culturally effective manner; * Universal Newborn Screening Programs that help support state newborn screening and genetics programs, integrate newborn and genetic screening programs with other community services and medical homes, and strengthen existing newborn and genetic screening and service programs; * Sickle Cell Service Demonstrations establish coordinated, comprehensive and family-centered networks to promote the integration of primary and subspecialty health care within medical homes for persons with sickle cell diseases and other hemoglobinopathies; * Emergency Medical Services for Children grants to states, U.S. territories, the District of Columbia, and schools of medicine to improve existing emergency medical services systems for treating children and to develop and evaluate procedures and protocols; * Home Visiting Programs which aim to facilitate collaboration and partnership at the federal, state and community levels to improve health and development outcomes for at-risk children through evidence-based home visiting programs. Through the Affordable Care Act, 13 states were granted over $69 million to expand the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Program activities. * Healthy Tomorrows grants promote maternal and child health by encouraging community-based programs to enhance prevention strategies and to make health care for pregnant women, infants, children and youth more accessible. * State Systems Development Initiative which complements the Title V MCH Block Grant Program to offer Title V agencies access to policy and program-relevant information and data.

It has a population of about 600. It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia, in the Silesian Foothills. The name of the village is possessive in origin derived from personal name Kisiel.  History  Archaeological traces of the first farmers in the area from Lengyel culture (4th millennia BC) have been found in the village. The village was first mentioned in the letter issued by Wenceslaus I, Duke of Cieszyn on 12 March 1434 in which he bestowed a place called Lochni/Locheny (≈ÅƒÖczka?) adjacent to an older village Kiesselaw (Kisiel√≥w) upon Ticzko von Logau. Politically it belonged to the Duchy of Teschen, since 1327 a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village became a seat of a Catholic parish, mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deanery as Kyselaw. Since 1704 it belonged to Cselesta von Cselestin family. Together with I≈Çownica it was bought from Karl Freyherrn von Celesta by Teschener Kammer in 1792 for 120,000 florins. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielitz (Bielsko) and the legal district of Skotschau (Skocz√≥w). According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 289 in 1880 to 356 in 1910, with a majority of the inhabitants being native Polish-speakers (98.6%‚Äì100%) and a few people were Czech-speaking (most 5 or 1.4% in 1910), in terms of religion the majority were Roman Catholics (70.8% in 1910), followed by Protestants (29.2% in 1910). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.

Often, variation is quantified as variance; then, the more specific term explained variance can be used. The complementary part of the total variation is called unexplained or residual variation.  Definition in terms of information gain  = Information gain by better modelling = Following Kent (1983), we use the Fraser information (Fraser 1965) :F(\\\\theta) = \\\\int \\\\textrm{d}r\\\\,g(r)\\\\,\\\\ln f(r;\\\\theta) where g(r) is the probability density of a random variable R\\\\,, and f(r;\\\\theta)\\\\, with \\\\theta\\\\in\\\\Theta_i (i=0,1\\\\,) are two families of parametric models. Model family 0 is the simpler one, with a restricted parameter space \\\\Theta_0\\\\subset\\\\Theta_1. Parameters are determined by maximum likelihood estimation, :\\\\theta_i = \\\\operatorname{arg max}_{\\\\theta\\\\in\\\\Theta_i} F(\\\\theta). The information gain of model 1 over model 0 is written as :\\\\Gamma(\\\\theta_1:\\\\theta_0) = 2 [ F(\\\\theta_1)-F(\\\\theta_0) ]\\\\, where a factor of 2 is included for convenience. Œì is always nonnegative; it measures the extent to which the best model of family 1 is better than the best model of family 0 in explaining g(r). = Information gain by a conditional model = Assume a two-dimensional random variable R=(X,Y) where X shall be considered as an explanatory variable, and Y as a dependent variable. Models of family 1 \\"explain\\" Y in terms of X, :f(y\\\\mid x;\\\\theta), whereas in family 0, X and Y are assumed to be independent. We define the randomness of Y by D(Y)=\\\\exp[-2F(\\\\theta_0)], and the randomness of Y, given X, by D(Y\\\\mid X)=\\\\exp[-2F(\\\\theta_1)]. Then, :\\\\rho_C^2 = 1-D(Y\\\\mid X)/D(Y) can be interpreted as proportion of the data dispersion which is \\"explained\\" by X.  Special cases and generalized usage  = Linear regression = The fraction of variance unexplained is an established concept in the context of linear regression. The usual definition of the coefficient of determination is based on the fundamental concept of explained variance. = Correlation coefficient as measure of explained variance = Let X be a random vector, and Y a random variable that is modeled by a normal distribution with centre \\\\mu+\\\\Psi^\\\\textrm{T}X. In this case, the above-derived proportion of explained variation \\\\rho_C^2 equals the squared correlation coefficient R^2. Note the strong model assumptions: the centre of the Y distribution must be a linear function of X, and for any given x, the Y distribution must be normal. In other situations, it is generally not justified to interpret R^2 as proportion of explained variance. = In principal component analysis = Explained variance is routinely used in principal component analysis. The relation to the Fraser‚ÄìKent information gain remains to be clarified.  Criticism  As the fraction of \\"explained variance\\" equals the squared correlation coefficient R^2, it shares all the disadvantages of the latter: it reflects not only the quality of the regression, but also the distribution of the independent (conditioning) variables. In the words of one critic: \\"Thus R^2 gives the 'percentage of variance explained' by the regression, an expression that, for most social scientists, is of doubtful meaning but great rhetorical value. If this number is large, the regression gives a good fit, and there is little point in searching for additional variables. Other regression equations on different data sets are said to be less satisfactory or less powerful if their R^2 is lower. Nothing about R^2 supports these claims\\". And, after constructing an example where R^2 is enhanced just by jointly considering data from two different populations: \\"'Explained variance' explains nothing.\\"  See also  *Analysis of variance *Variance reduction *Variance-based sensitivity analysis  References   External links  *Explained and Unexplained Variance on a graph Category:Regression analysis Category:Statistics articles needing expert attention ","title":"Explained variation"},{"id":"14922011","text":"Gmina Tarnogr√≥d is an urban-rural gmina (administrative district) in Bi≈Çgoraj County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland.

It meant that the village was supposed to pay a tithe from 13 greater lans. The creation of the village was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what will be later known as Upper Silesia. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty.

In both villages a majority of the inhabitants were native Polish-speakers (99.1%-100% in Kozakowice Dolne and 99.3%-100% in Kozakowice G√≥rne; not more than 2 people speaking a different language), in terms of religion the majority were Protestants (in 1910 90.6 in Kozakowice Dolne and 82.6% in Kozakowice G√≥rne), followed by Roman Catholics (in 1910 9.4% in Kozakowice Dolne and 17.4% in Kozakowice G√≥rne). The villages were also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, they became a part of Poland. They were then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war they were restored to Poland.  People  Andrzej Cincia≈Ça, Polish lawyer and activist was born here.

Specifically, deceit requires that the tortfeasor * makes a factual representation, * knowing that it is false, or reckless or indifferent about its veracity, * intending that another person relies on it, * who then acts in reliance on it, to that person's own detriment. Deceit dates in its modern development from Pasley v. Freeman.Pasley v. Freeman, (1789) 3 TR 51 Here the defendant said that a third party was creditworthy to the claimant, knowing he was broke. The claimant loaned the third party money and lost it. He sued the defendant successfully. Relationship with negligence The leading case in English law is Derry v. Peek, which was decided before the development of the law on negligent misstatement. In Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v. Heller & Partners Ltd it was decided that people who make statements which they ought to have known were untrue because they were negligent, can in some circumstances, to restricted groups of claimants be liable to make compensation for any loss flowing, despite the decision in Derry v Peek. This falls under the so-called \\"voluntary assumption of responsibility\\" test. In Bradford Equitable B S. v Borders,Bradford Equitable B S. v Borders, [1941] 2 All ER 205, HL it was held that in addition the maker of the statement must have intended for the claimant to have relied upon the statement. Negligence and deceit differ with respect to remoteness of damages. In deceit the defendant is liable for all losses flowing directly from the tort, whether they were foreseeable or not.; Clef Aquitaine SARL v. Laporte Materials (Barrow) Ltd [2000] 2 All ER 493 In Doyle v. Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd Lord Denning MR remarked, \\"it does not lie in the mouth of the fraudulent person to say that they could not reasonably have been foreseen.\\" So where there is a sudden downturn in the property market, a person guilty of deceitful misrepresentation is liable for all the claimant's losses, even if they have been increased by such an unanticipated event.Slough Estates Ltd v. Welwyn- Hatfield District Council [1996] 2 PLR 50 This is subject to a duty to mitigate the potential losses.Downs v. Chappell [1997] 1 WLR 426, where a conned car buyer only recovered losses up to the time he should have sold the car on Contributory negligence is no defence in an action for deceit.Alliance and Leicester BS v. Edgestop Ltd [1993] 1 WLR 1462 However proving deceit is far more difficult than proving negligence, because of the requirement for intention.

He was called to the Quebec Bar in 1864 and practiced law with future Premier of Quebec Joseph-Alfred Mousseau until 1872. In 1862, David became a co-owner and editor of the newspaper the Colonisateur. After the paper ceased publication he became an editor with the paper, L‚ÄôUnion nationale, an antifederalist newspaper which would cease publication in 1867. It was while working at this newspaper that he established a friendship with Wilfrid Laurier which would continue until the end of Laurier's life. He unsuccessfully ran for the Legislative Assembly of Quebec for the electoral district of Hochelaga in the 1867 election and again in 1875. From 1870 to 1873, he was the editor-in-chief of the Montreal weekly newspaper L‚ÄôOpinion publique. From 1874 to 1876, he was a co-founder and co-owner of the Le Bien public.

He was known for his abilities and strong will, which eventually led to a conflict with Wu Zetian's secret police official Lai Junchen. He was executed on the same day as Lai, who was in turn accused by others of treason.  Background  It is not known when Li Zhaode was born, but it is known that his family was from the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an. His father Li Qianyou () served as an imperial censor during the reign of Tang's second emperor Emperor Taizong and later as minister of justice during the reign of Emperor Taizong's son and Wu Zetian's husband Emperor Gaozong, and was known for his honesty but carelessness with words. Li Zhaode was the son of a concubine of Li Qianyou, and was said to be capable and strong-willed like his father, and he passed the imperial examination when he was young. He was eventually promoted to be an assistant censor (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û, Yushi Zhongcheng), but in 689, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong's son Emperor Ruizong, he was accused of improprieties unspecified in history and briefly exiled to be the sheriff of Lingshui County (ÈôµÊ∞¥, modern Lingshui, Hainan), but was eventually recalled to be one of the three deputy ministers of defense (Â§èÂÆò‰æçÈÉé, Xiaguan Shilang), along with Lou Shide and Hou Zhiyi ().Li's biography in the Old Book of Tang placed his recall in 693 and indicated that he became chancellor thereafter. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 87. However, as he was clearly chancellor by 692 according to the chronologies of Wu Zetian's reign in both the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang, this dating cannot be correct. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 6 and New Book of Tang, vol. 4.  Service under Wu Zetian  = As chancellor = As of 692‚Äîafter Wu Zetian had seized the throne from her son Emperor Ruizong in 690 and taken the throne herself, establishing Zhou and interrupting Tang‚ÄîLi Zhaode was still serving as the deputy minister of defense when he secretly suggested to Wu Zetian that her nephew Wu Chengsi the Prince of Wei was becoming too powerful. She initially responded, \\"He is my nephew, and so I I trust him.\\" Li Zhaode responded: She was persuaded, and in fall 692, she reorganized her administration, removing Wu Chengsi, his cousin Wu Youning, and fellow chancellor Yang Zhirou from their positions as chancellors. As part of the reorganization, Li Zhaode was made Fengge Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (È≥≥Èñ£, Fengge), and given the designation of Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto; also made chancellors at the same time were Cui Yuanzong, Yao Shu, Li Yuansu, and Cui Shenji, and several days later, so was Wang Xuan. Around that time, there was a group of petitioners led by one Wang Qingzhi (), who advocated that Wu Chengsi be made crown prince, displacing her son Li Dan (the former Emperor Ruizong), and Wu Zetian, while not granting the petition, permitted Wang to see her frequently in the palace. However, Wang was coming to the palace too often, displeasing her, and she ordered Li Zhaode to batter Wang‚Äîand Li Zhaode, quite intentionally, battered Wang to death, causing the group of petitioners he led to disband. He then spoke to Wu Zetian: Wu Zetian agreed with his rationale and did not make Wu Chengsi crown prince.The Zizhi Tongjian placed this event in 691, but also indicated that Li Zhaode was then Fengge Shilang. As he did not become Fengge Shilang until 692, the event likely happened then. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 204. Because of this, Wu Chengsi despised Li Zhaode and tried to speak against him, but Wu Zetian responded, \\"I can only sleep because I promoted Li Zhaode, as he took over the hard work on my behalf. Do not speak further.\\" Meanwhile, Wu Zetian was rebuilding the capital Luoyang to make it a magnificent capital, and Li Zhaode was particularly said to be responsible for the magnificence of the new executive bureau (ÊñáÊòåËá∫, Wenchang Tai) building, as well as Dingding () and Shangdong () Gates. He also built Luoyang's outer walls. Moreover, there was a bridge over the Luo River (Ê¥õÊ∞¥, flowing near Luoyang) near the Changxia Gate () that the minister of agriculture Wei Ji () had built during Emperor Gaozong's reign that was useful and had heavy traffic, but was repeatedly damaged by the flow of the Luo River and required constant repairs. Li Zhaode devised a stone formation before the bridge that diverted the water strength, which allowed the bridge to stand without further damage. It was also said that Li Zhaode did much to try to curb the power of Wu Zetian's secret police officials, who were often falsely accusing people of treason and killing them, and that he, in particular, killed Hou Sizhi. In 694, Li Zhaode was made acting Neishi (), the head of the legislative bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor. Also around that time, Wu Zetian put her lover Huaiyi the Duke of E in command of an army against Eastern Tujue and made Li Zhaode and fellow chancellor Su Weidao Huaiyi's assistants, although Eastern Tujue forces withdrew before the army could launch, and therefore the army never set out. It was said that when Li Zhaode had a disagreement with Huaiyi, Huaiyi began to hit him, and Li Zhaode, despite his reputation for fortitude, was fearful and apologized. Meanwhile, Li Zhaode gained a reputation for monopolizing power, drawing hatred from other officials. Later in 694, after petitions by the officials Qiu Yin () and Deng Zhu () that accused Li Zhaode of abuse of power, Wu Zetian began to dislike Li Zhaode. In fall 694, she demoted Li Zhaode to be the sheriff of Nanbin County (ÂçóË≥ì, in modern Qinzhou, Guangxi). She also soon sentenced Li Zhaode to death but commuted the sentence to removal from office and exile. Fellow chancellors Doulu Qinwang, Wei Juyuan, Du Jingjian, Su, and Lu Yuanfang were accused of not being able to curb in Li Zhaode's abuses and were demoted. = Return from exile and death = At a later point, however, Li Zhaode was recalled from exile to serve as imperial censor (Áõ£ÂØüÂæ°Âè≤, Jiancha Yushi), and his enmity with the secret police official Lai Junchen, previously in place, was renewed. Further, on one occasion, he insulted Huangfu Wenbei () the deputy minister of justice. In 697, Lai and Huangfu therefore falsely accused Li Zhaode of treason, and Li Zhaode was arrested. Meanwhile, however, Lai himself was said to be plotting to further falsely accuse the Wu clan princes, Princess Taiping, Li Dan, and Li Dan's brother Li Zhe the Prince of Luling, of plotting treason. When this was revealed by his friend Wei Suizhong (), the Wu clan princes and Princess Taiping accused him of crimes. Later in 697, Lai and Li Zhaode were executed on the same day, and it was said that there was no one who did not mourn Li Zhaode while rejoicing at Lai's death. Li Zhaode was eventually posthumously honored during both the resumed reign of Li Zhe (Emperor Zhongzong) in 706 and Emperor Dezong in 782.

Life Key claimed to have been bent psychokinetically by Manning In the 1960s, it was alleged that Manning was the focus of poltergeist activity. He started performing automatic drawing and writings. Covering his bedroom walls appeared over six hundred signatures spanning six centuries. Nickell, Joe. (2015). \\"Poltergeist Scribbler: The Bizarre Case of Matthew Manning\\". Skeptical Inquirer. Retrieved 30 April 2016. It was noted at the time that Manning had been researching history as part of his school work. According to Joe Nickell who made an in-depth study of Manning's writings, they contain internal inconsistencies and the \\"signatures\\" are completely inaccurate for historical individuals. Nickell concluded that Manning has \\"traits associated with a fantasy-prone personality\\" and there is no evidence he possesses genuine paranormal powers. Regarding his automatic drawings, he claimed to draw in the styles of many famous artists including Pablo Picasso. Manning told The San Francisco Examiner that an art expert at Sotheby's in London had thought one of his Picasso copies so good it might be mistaken for an original. The sceptic James Randi investigated this claim by writing to the gallery. A Sotheby's official replied that the claim was \\"absolutely not true\\" as they were forgeries of existing works.Gordon, Henry. (1988). Extrasensory Deception: ESP, Psychics, Shirley MacLaine, Ghosts, UFOs. Macmillan of Canada. pp. 101‚Äì102. Manning told the London Daily Mirror his drawing of a monkey had caused \\"great excitement\\" because it was strikingly similar to an original by Jan Savery that the Rijksmuseum kept locked away from public display in a vault. This was also investigated by Randi who wrote a letter to the museum and it was discovered the claim was false as the original was on display to the public, not locked up in a vault. Manning was also tested for psychokinetic abilities by parapsychologist William G. Braud of the Mind Science Foundation in the late 1970s, with results that, according to Braud and coauthors in a psychical research paper published in 1979, were better than chance.Questia.com Library JournalHaynes, Ren√©e.

Its capital is Dublin. * Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom, which lies in the northeast of the island. Its capital is Belfast. Since the enactment of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922, these two jurisdictions have been governed separately. The Good Friday Agreement of 1998 created a framework of shared political institutions between the two parts of Ireland, and also facilitated the restoration of self-government to Northern Ireland, subject to a number of reserved and excepted matters. Thus, there are three administrations that govern Ireland: * Northern Ireland:  Government of the United Kingdom (reserved and excepted matters)  Northern Ireland Executive (all other matters) * Republic of Ireland:  Government of Ireland (all matters) In addition to these, both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom were member states of the European Union but on 31st January 2020 the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the bloc after 47 years of membership, (the UK and Republic of Ireland both joined together as members to the then European Communities on 1 January 1973) which will then leave the Republic of Ireland as a EU member state and Northern Ireland as part of the UK outside of the EU. Good Friday institutions The Good Friday Agreement established three bodies between the three administrations: * North/South Ministerial Council * British‚ÄìIrish Intergovernmental Conference * North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association The purpose of the North/South Ministerial Council is to agree and implement policies common to or shared by both jurisdictions in at least 12 areas where Northern Ireland has competency. At least six of these must to be areas where policy is agreed together but implemented separately through existing agencies in each jurisdiction. At least six further areas of co-operate must be areas were policy is agreed together and implemented through all-island or cross-border agencies. For example, food safety is managed by the all-Ireland Food Safety Promotion Board whereas transport policies may be agreed together but are implemented separately in each jurisdiction. The British‚ÄìIrish Intergovernmental Conference is a forum through which the two sovereign governments can reach consensus on areas of mutual interest, including the government of Northern Ireland. Lastly, the North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association is a joint parliamentary forum created between the national parliament of the Republic of Ireland (the Oireachtas) and the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Good Friday Agreement also envisages a consultative forum formed from members of civil society, the North/South Consultative Forum. However, this has yet to be established. Devolution of power to Northern Ireland from the UK central government is dependent upon the participation of the Northern Ireland Executive in the North/South Ministerial Council. If devolution in Northern Ireland is suspended, whether owing to the failure of the Northern Ireland Executive to participate in the North/South Ministerial Council or otherwise, the powers of the Northern Ireland Executive revert to the British‚ÄìIrish Intergovernmental Conference. Political parties and other bodies Three major political parties, Sinn F√©in, the Green Party and, most recently, Fianna F√°il, as well as several smaller parties, are organised on an all-island basis.

The highway runs from MD 28 in Gaithersburg north to MD 108 in Damascus. MD 124 connects the central and northern Montgomery County communities of Gaithersburg, Montgomery Village, Redland, Laytonsville, and Damascus. The route is a major conduit on the western and northern sides of Gaithersburg, where the highway serves the National Institute of Standards and Technology and Lakeforest Mall and connects with Interstate 270 (I-270) and MD 355. MD 124 continues north past the Montgomery County Airpark, beyond which the route changes from a four- to six-lane divided highway to a two-lane road as it passes west of Laytonsville on its way to Damascus. MD 124 was built from Laytonsville south to Redland by 1910 and constructed from Gaithersburg to its southern end in the early 1910s. The intervening segment between Gaithersburg and Redland was built via Washington Grove in the early 1920s. MD 124's original route was completed when Laytonsville-Damascus highway was constructed between the mid-1920s and early 1930s. The highway bypassed Laytonsville in the late 1950s. MD 124 was rerouted through the western portion of Gaithersburg in the mid-1970s along a highway built in the mid-1950s concurrent with I-270 construction; the old route eventually became part of MD 117. In the mid-1990s. the highway was rerouted again north of MD 355, bypassing downtown Gaithersburg and Washington Grove along highways built by Montgomery County in the mid-1970s and late 1980s. MD 124 was expanded to a divided highway around I-270 by the mid-1970s, between there and its southern end in the late 1980s and late 1990s, along its northern bypass of Gaithersburg when it was placed on the bypass, and near the Montgomery County Airpark in 2010. Route description View south along the Midcounty Highway portion of MD 124 in Gaithersburg MD 124 begins as Quince Orchard Road at an intersection with MD 28 (Darnestown Road) adjacent to Quince Orchard High School at the southwestern corner of the city of Gaithersburg. Quince Orchard Road heads south as a county highway into North Potomac. MD 124 heads northeast as a four-lane divided highway that follows the city limit to Long Draft Road and Kentlands Boulevard; the latter street provides access to the New Urbanism community of Kentlands. The state highway veers east into the city and intersects MD 119 (Great Seneca Highway). MD 124 again follows a city limit of Gaithersburg where it veers north and becomes an undivided highway along the western edge of the National Institute of Standards and Technology campus, which occupies an unincorporated enclave within the city. MD 124 fully re-enters Gaithersburg at its junction with MD 117, which heads west as Clopper Road and east as West Diamond Avenue toward downtown Gaithersburg. The highway remains undivided until its passes under CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision, which carries MARC's Brunswick Line. North of the railroad crossing, MD 124 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-270 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway), with a park and ride lot serving MTA Maryland commuter buses located in the southwest quadrant of the interchange. There is no access from northbound MD 124 to southbound I-270 or from northbound I-270 to southbound MD 124; those movements are made via MD 117. North of its underpass of the freeway, MD 124 expands to six lanes and again to eight lanes for a short distance on either side of its intersection with MD 355 (Frederick Road). Including turn lanes, the highway is 11 lanes wide on the south side of the intersection. There is no direct access from southbound MD 124 to southbound MD 355; that movement is made via Russell Avenue, which provides access to Lakeforest Mall to the east. MD 124 continues north from MD 355 as six-lane Montgomery Village Avenue. North of the mall, the state highway leaves the city limits and turns east onto four-lane Midcounty Highway; Montgomery Village Avenue continues through the heart of Montgomery Village. MD 124 re-enters Gaithersburg at its intersection with Goshen Road. The highway leaves and enters the city limits again around its crossing of Whetstone Run. East of the stream, MD 124 turns north onto Woodfield Road, a four-lane divided highway that exits Gaithersburg for the last time at Emory Grove Road and drops to three lanes (two northbound, one southbound), and then two. The highway expands to a four-lane divided highway again between Flower Hill Way--which leads to Washington Grove Lane, which leads to the town of Washington Grove--and MD 115 (Muncaster Mill Road) on the western edge of Redland. MD 124 continues as a four-lane undivided highway through an industrial area surrounding the Montgomery County Airpark. South of Airpark Road, which provides access to the airport, MD 124 expands to a six-lane divided highway, which it remains until Fieldcrest Road. North of that county road, the highway gradually drops lanes and the median until it is a two-lane highway at East Village Avenue, a county highway into the northeastern part of Montgomery Village. MD 124 passes to the west of Laytonsville; access to the town is provided via Warfield Road and Brink Road. North of the latter highway, the state highway crosses Goshen Branch and Great Seneca Creek. MD 124 passes through the hamlet of Woodfield and parallels the Magruder Branch of Great Seneca Creek into the unincorporated community of Damascus. The highway reaches its northern terminus on the eastern edge of downtown Damascus at an intersection with MD 108 (Main Street). Woodfield Road continues north as a county highway; either MD 108 or Woodfield Road may be used to access MD 27 (Ridge Road). MD 124 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from MD 28 to the Midcounty Highway-Woodfield Road intersection in Gaithersburg. History MD 124 northbound at MD 28 in Gaithersburg The first portion of MD 124 constructed as a modern highway was from Muncaster Mill Road to Warfield Road, then along Warfield Road and Laytonsville Road to Brink Road in Laytonsville. This section was paved as a macadam road by Montgomery County with state aid by 1910. The second segment to be built was from Darnestown Road to Clopper Road, then east along what is now MD 117 to the west town limit of Gaithersburg. This portion was planned as one of the original state roads by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. The highway was placed under construction in 1911 and completed as a macadam road in 1912. The continuation of the highway along West Diamond Avenue to Frederick Road in Gaithersburg was completed in 1914. The gap between Gaithersburg and Muncaster Mill Road was filled with a concrete road by 1921. This highway followed East Diamond Avenue through downtown Gaithersburg to Washington Grove, then Washington Grove Lane north to Muncaster Mill Road. MD 124 traversed the gap between the two Diamond Avenues by following Frederick Road; that road's first bridge across the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX) was constructed in 1930. After the bridge was built, MD 124 had oblique intersections with U.S. Route 240 (now MD 355) on both sides of the railroad. Construction on the highway between Laytonsville and Damascus began in 1925; a concrete road was built from the center of Laytonsville west along Brink Road, then north along Woodfield Road to Goshen Branch. The concrete road was extended to Great Seneca Creek in 1928. The concrete road was started from the Damascus end in 1929 and extended to Woodfield by 1930. The gap between Great Seneca Creek and Woodfield was filled between 1931 and 1933; the highway was signed as MD 124 in the latter year when it was completed. MD 124's present course between Warfield Road and Brink Road was paved as a concrete road by 1950, but it did not become part of MD 124 until 1959. Warfield Road was transferred to Montgomery County and Brink Road from MD 124 to MD 108 became part of MD 420, a designation that lasted until 1974. Quince Orchard Road was extended north from the MD 124-MD 117 intersection to MD 355 concurrent with the construction of its interchange with Washington National Pike (now I-270) between 1954 and 1956. Access between the freeway and MD 124 was via the full cloverleaf interchange on the county-maintained segment of Quince Orchard Road; no interchange was constructed directly with MD 124. Montgomery Village Avenue was constructed from MD 355 north through Montgomery Village in 1974. The next year, MD 124 was removed from West Diamond Avenue and placed on Quince Orchard Road north to MD 355, then ran concurrently with MD 355 to downtown Gaithersburg. West Diamond Avenue was renumbered MD 924 by 1981 and then MD 117 by 1999. By 1978, MD 124 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from just south of the I-270 interchange to MD 355 then along MD 355 part of the way to downtown Gaithersburg. The divided highway was completed along the MD 124-MD 355 concurrency in 1979. MD 124 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from I-270 south to Long Draft Road in 1987. The divided highway was extended south to MD 28 in 1997. Midcounty Highway was built as a two-lane county highway from Montgomery Village Avenue to Shady Grove Road by 1989. MD 124 was expanded to a divided highway on either side of the MD 115 intersection in 1991. South of the intersection was a new alignment; the route used Flower Hill Way to bridge the gap between the new road and the old road, Washington Grove Lane. In 1995, the new divided highway was extended south to Midcounty Highway; Midcounty Highway was expanded to a divided highway from the new divided highway west to Montgomery Village Avenue; and MD 124 was removed from East Diamond Avenue and Washington Grove Lane and placed on its present course. MD 117's partial interchange with I-270 opened in 1987; two redundant ramps at the MD 124-I-270 interchange were removed in 1995. The ramp from southbound I-270 to northbound MD 124 was removed in favor of a traffic signal-controlled left turn in 2004. The state highway was expanded from an undivided two-to-three-lane road to a six-lane divided highway from south of Airpark Road to Fieldcrest Road in 2010.

Yakun or Jakun, deriving from Old Norse H√°kon, was a Varangian (Viking) leader who is mentioned in the Primary Chronicle and in the Cave monastery in Kiev. The chronicle tells that he arrived in Kievan Rus' in the year 1024 and fought in the Battle of Listven between the half-brothers Yaroslav I the Wise and Mstislav of Chernigov.Pritsak 1981:404Androshchuk 2004:44 Account Yaroslav had arrived in Novgorod and sent a request to Scandinavia that he needed Norse warriors. Yakun arrived as the leader of the Varangians and he was dressed in a robe that was woven with gold. In the autumn of 1024, Yaroslav and Yakun marched with their forces to Chernigov, but Mstislav had been informed of their approach and met them at Listven.Pritsak 1981:405 In the evening, when the battle took place, a thunderstorm appeared with rain that fell on the combatants. Mstislav had put his own retinue on the flanks, while he had positioned the Severians in the centre to engage with the Varangians. Mstislav ordered the Severians to attack and after a while the Varangians had exhausted themselves by fighting against the Severians. Seeing that the Vikings had become tired, Mstislav ordered his own troops to attack them as well. In the darkness of the thunderstorm, it was only when the lightning flared that they could see their own swords, and so they accidentally killed their own. After a while Yaroslav saw that his army was overpowered and he ordered retreat. Yakun lost his golden robe during the departure.Pritsak 1981:406 Yaroslav returned to Novgorod, while Yakun returned overseas and he died there. Mstislav observed the many dead Severians and Varangians, and was happy that no one in his own retinue had fallen. Blind or handsome In the Primary Chronicle, Yakun is described as slƒõp—ä which has been interpreted as either s—å lƒõp—ä meaning \\"the handsome one\\" or s—ålƒõp—ä which means \\"blind\\". Omeljan Pritsak notes that it is difficult to imagine a blind Viking commander although there have been blind generals in history, such as the Venetian doge Enrico Dandolo. He also argues that a blind Viking commander during the 11th century would have been remembered in Scandinavian sources.Pritsak 1981:412 Scandinavian sources Although old Russian sources often mention that the rulers of Kievan Rus' requested warriors from Scandinavia, Yakun is the only commander who is mentioned by name. However, his identification is rendered difficult by the fact that Old Russian sources and Old Norse sources rarely agree, as in the case of the Swedish princesses who married Yaroslav and Mstislav, where Russian sources give no hints of their origins. In Sweden, there are two runic inscriptions that mention a jarl named H√°kon, U 617 and Sm 76, but scholars disagree on whether the two runestones refer to the same person and who they were.Pritsak 1981:406ff All known Hakon Jarls have been involved in the debate: H√°kon Sigur√∞arson (d. 995), his grandson H√°kon Eir√≠ksson (d. 1029), H√°kon √çvarsson (d. 1062) and H√°kon P√°lsson (d. 1122).Pritsak 1981:407 The most common view among runologists (Brate, von Friesen, Wess√©n, Jansson, Kinander and Ruprecht) is that the two stones refer to different Hakon Jarls and that U 617 refers to a Swede and that Sm 76 refers to the Norwegian H√°kon Eir√≠ksson together with U 16. Based on the interpretation that Yakun was handsome, Pritsak identifies him as the Norwegian jarl H√•kon Eiriksson whose family is said to have been unusually handsome in Snorri Sturluson's Haralds saga Sigur√∞arsonar ch 40-41.Pritsak 1981:412ff Moreover, the fact that H√•kon Eiriksson belonged to a royal dynasty would explain why the Primary Chronicle mentioned him as a king and an equal to Yaroslav. Additionally, in Austrfarav√≠sur (strophe 19) it is reported that when the skald Sigvatr √û√≥r√∞arson arrived in Sweden in 1023, he learned of \\"treason\\" in Kievan Rus' (probably in respect to Olaf II of Norway) which would have been done by a man of Eir√≠kr H√°konarson's family. Eir√≠k had been banished from Norway by Olaf II of Norway in 1014.Pritsak 1981:414 Other sources show that he was earl in Mercia, England in the interval from 1019 to his return to Norway in 1028. Family In the cave monastery in Kiev there is a collection of stories on saints and one of them tells of the Varangian ≈†imon (Sigmundr) who was the son of the Varangian lord Afrikan (Alfrekr). The latter was the brother of Yakun and after Afrikan's death Yakun banished ≈†imon from his kingdom and he lived the rest of his life in exile in Kievan Rus' serving both Yaroslav and his son.

It is a derivative of naproxen with a nitroxybutyl ester to allow it to also act as a nitric oxide (NO) donor. This second mechanism of action makes naproxcinod the first in a new class of drugs, the cyclooxygenase inhibiting nitric oxide donators (CINODs), that are hoped to produce similar analgesic efficacy to traditional NSAIDs, but with less gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects. In December 2006, Scientific American distinguished naproxcinod as one of the ten most promising treatments for the world's biggest health threats;Special Report: 10 Promising Treatments for World's Biggest Health Threats, By Charles Q. Choi. 2006 however, in 2010 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determined that further clinical trials would be needed to obtain approval. Current situation in pain treatment Many people are currently relying on traditional NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors (for example celecoxib) to treat chronic pain and inflammation. COX-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events such as strokes or heart attacks. Therefore, there is an unmet need for safer medications. This need is particularly acute among patients with high cardiovascular risk like hypertension which represents 50% of osteoarthritis sufferers. Indications Three phase III clinical trials led by NicOx have shown that naproxcinod was effective to treat pain against knee osteoarthritis and hip osteoarthrtis. A phase II study showed no significant differences in efficacy between naproxcinod and the COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib in the treatment of pain. In osteoarthritis, a 750 mg dose is equipotent to 500 mg of naproxen for the treatment of inflammation but with the added benefit of attenuating the cardiovascular effects traditionally associated with NSAIDs. In July 2010 the FDA decided not to approve naproxcinod.NicOx Shares Plummet as FDA Says Osteoarthritis Drug Not Ready for Approval Mechanism of action Naproxcinoid is metabolized to naproxen and a nitric oxide donating moiety. NO has various cardiovascular effects, including vasodilatory and platelet- inhibitory actions as well as the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle proliferation that serves to maintain normal vascular tone. Safety profile =Blood pressure profile= According to some experts, cardiovascular risks induced by COX-2 inhibitors are caused by increases in blood pressure. Naproxcinod demonstrated in a clinical trial with 916 patients to have a blood pressure profile similar to placebo. Two phase II randomized controlled trials have shown a decreased systolic blood pressure by 2.1 mmHg after patients took naproxcinod (375 mg or 750 mg twice daily) for six weeks. These effects were especially pronounced in hypertensive populations. Clinical relevance of small increase in blood pressure During a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) COX-2 advisory committee meeting, doctors have underlined the important role of small increase in blood pressure. They cited the CAMELOT trial which has concluded that even a small decrease in systolic blood pressure of 5 mmHg could lead to a reduction of 31% in cardiovascular events. Clinical studies about rofecoxib have shown that this drug increases the systolic blood pressure. A 2005 analysis shows that a blood pressure decrease of 3.1 mmHG could avoid over 30,000 deaths from stroke and 2,000 deaths from coronary disease, resulting in more than 449,000 person years of life saved and 1.4 billion US$ in direct health care cost savings. =Gastrointestinal safety= NSAIDs have also been associated with gastrointestinal risks such as bleedings. Early studies demonstrated that naproxcinod had a better gastrointestinal profile than naproxen, especially for the gastroduodenal mucosa, but a 2009 review has found only a slight and possibly not clinically relevant reduction of gastrointestinal side-effects.Schubert-Zsilavecz, M, Wurglics, M, Neue Arzneimittel 2010 Contraindications and adverse effects Similarly to NSAIDs, adverse effects of naproxcinod include gastrointestinal bleedings. Commercialization Naproxcinod completed a phase III study needed for a New Drug Application (NDA). As a result, Nicox submitted its project to the FDA in September 2009. In July 2010, the FDA decided not to approve naproxcinod without further clinical trials.

It is located between the neighbourhoods of Nyg√•rd and M√∏hlenpris. Covering , Nyg√•rdsparken is the largest urban park in Bergen. History Nyg√•rdsparken was conceived by the physicians Joachim Georg Wiesener and Klaus Hanssen, who founded the Park Association of Nygaard (Nygaards Parkselskab) in 1880. Modeled on the typical English park, it was laid out by the Danish gardener S. Lund Leiberg. In 1898 the \\"Bergen exhibition\\" changed the park into an exhibition area. With a ticket costing 50 √∏re you could visit a small zoo and a botanical garden, study objects from Nansen's polar expeditions, and take the elevator to the top of Wisbech & Meinich's \\"Panorama tower with electric elevator\\". A lift attendant in uniform was in charge of what was most likely the first elevator in Bergen. Norway's first elevator was namely produced in the same year, in Wisbech's factory in Christiania. Today Autumn in Nyg√•rdsparken. Following the uncontrolled expansion of the city in the last half of the 20th century, the population in the city centre fell dramatically. While Nyg√•rdsparken had earlier been within short walking distance of 30,000 to 40,000 people, this was no longer the case. As a result, the interest in the park fell, leading to a lack of maintenance. Eventually, drug addicts, lacking better places to stay, began using the park for their purposes. Nyg√•rdsparken evolved into the main drug area in Bergen, with sale of heroin, cannabis and other drugs taking place all day and night. The police have been criticised both for not paying attention to the amount of drug abuse taking place in the park, and for not taking action against drug dealers or the drug addicts themselves. As part of a plan to increase the kindergarten capacity in Bergen, the municipality decided in 2007 to build seven temporary kindergartens in Bergen, including one in Nyg√•rdsparken, with a total capacity of 550 children. Due to protests from locals, mostly concerning the unaesthetic appearance of the kindergarten and it being constructed too close to existing buildings, the construction has been halted several times, but the kindergarten is now in use.

The problem of explaining the mind is so complex as to require \\"big science\\" to make real progress. The effort stemmed from concerns in the scientific community that mind research (as opposed to simply brain research) had received inadequate support relative to its importance in human lives. The Project began with a conference of leading US scientists at George Mason University in May 2007 which led to The Decade of the Mind Manifesto, published as a letter to the editor in Science. The Manifesto called for a new $4B US investment in research across the many disciplines of mind research over the decade from 2012 to 2022. Since the May 2007 meeting, the Decade of the Mind Project has held several other conferences across the United States and has been internationalised with a conference in Berlin, Germany, in September 2009 and a conference in Singapore in October 2010. The conference in Berlin, Germany, organised by Professor Manfred Spitzer, focused on the impact of this project on education, where they reported that this project could be see improved educational outcomes, particularly in STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). Around a year after this, they held a conference in Singapore in October 2010, organised by the Singapore Ministry of Defence, which was centred on the concept of applying the knowledge of human minds to both machines and the augmented cognition for human beings. Background During the 1990s US President George Herbert Walker Bush declared a decade of research to center on neuroscience. The resulting Decade of the Brain was a well publicized inter-US agency initiative that responded to the declaration. The two lead federal agencies in that initiative were the Library of Congress and the National Institute of Mental Health (part of the larger National Institutes of Health). Although the initiative did not receive the level of funding as the Human Genome Project, it did serve to catalyze significant advances in our understanding of the brain particularly in the context of brain diseases. The Decade of the Brain project was followed in 2001 by a Decade of Behavior Project that also attempted to bring together scientists, this time to understand how human behavior emerges. A new Decade Project More recent advances in brain research, in combination with the scientific consensus that mind indeed emerges as a result of the activities of the brain, has led to the notion of a new \\"Decade\\" project, one dedicated to understanding the phenomenon of mind within the context of neuroscience and psychology. In May 2007, a group of scientists met at George Mason University's Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study to map out a roadmap for the Initiative. The starting point was the earlier Decade of the Brain project Decade of the Mind Videos - Think. Learn. Succeed - George Mason University. The Decade of the Mind project seeks as much as $4 billion in federal support over the course of the ten-year-long initiative. The goal is to use the new federal support to jump start advances in our scientific understanding of mind as well as to use that same research to serve as an economic engine for the United States. From an international perspective, the Decade of the Mind project seeks to involve scientists from across the globe in this effort, not only to improve the public health, but also to create new jobs from the new technologies developed under the Project. The Decade of the Mind initiative, by necessity, should be trans-disciplinary and multi-agency in its approach. Success will require research that reaches across disparate fields such as cognitive science, medicine, neuroscience, psychology, mathematics, engineering, neurotechnology and computer science. Additional important insights will need to come from areas as diverse as systems biology, cultural anthropology, social science, robotics, and automation technology. For these reasons, the Decade of the Mind initiative should focus on these four broad areas: 300px # Healing and protecting the mind: This is the notion of improving the public health by ameliorating or curing diseases of the brain that affect the mind. An example of such a disease is Alzheimer's disease. Reducing the burden of such diseases would be a major deliverable for the Project. # Understanding the mind: This aspect of the initiative seeks to understand how the mind actually emerges from brain functional activity. Some of the key characteristics of the mind which are still not understood include consciousness, memory and dreams. The mystery of the mind remains one of the biggest scientific challenges for this and future generations. # Enriching the mind: Improving learning outcomes in education is a key component of the initiative. Here the hope is that advances in neuroscience research can be applied to K-20 schooling to create a more educated future workforce better able to compete for quality jobs. # Modeling the mind: A key approach to understanding the mind is to model it either analytically or using computers. Such models of mind may facilitate the creation of new hypotheses which can then be tested in the laboratory or clinic. Modeling the mind may also allow for the creation of new applications, technologies and inventions. The first Decade of the Mind symposium The Decade of the Mind symposium was well-covered by the news mediaJoel Achenbach: What makes up my mind? Dallas Morning News and led to a manifesto that was published in the journal Science authored by the symposium participants. Follow-on to the Decade of the Mind symposium Following the symposium, decision-makers from multiple US agencies assembled to react to the Manifesto and to imagine how their agencies might participate in the proposed Decade of the Mind initiative (Decade of the Mind II). A further follow-on scientific conference was held May 7‚Äì9, 2008 at the Great Ape Trust in Des Moines, Iowa. The symposium, titled \\"Emergence of Mind\\" examined how mind emerges in animals, particularly the great apesDecade of the Mind III Symposium: Emergence of Mind, Des Moines, Iowa, May 7, 8, 9, 2008. This third symposium included 9 plenary sessions provided by luminaries from their respective fields. Each speaker addressed the general topic of \\"Consciousness and Mind in Nonhuman Primates\\", some from the perspective of their experimental work with primates in captivity and others, from their studies of primates conducted in the wild. Additionally, two sessions were devoted to philosophical perspectives on nonhuman consciousness and the evolution of consciousness and mind. The fourth symposium was held at Santa Ana Reservation, New Mexico on January 13‚Äì15, 2009. The conference was organized by the Sandia National Laboratory. It focused on the emergence of mind in machines. The meeting also focused on the ethical, legal and social implications of new neurotechnologies that might emerge from the Decade Project. The Decade of the Mind Project became internationalized with a European initiative in Berlin, Germany, at a meeting in September 2009, and an Asian Decade of the Mind Project Symposium kicked off in Singapore in October 2010.

Rise to Power Ever since the death of Serfoji I, Shahuji II desired to occupy the throne. However, on Serfoji I's death in 1728, throne passed on to his younger brother Tukkoji. Not until the death of Tukkoji in 1736 was Katturaja able to place his claim on the throne. Katturaja did not make any claim to the throne during the short rule of Ekoji II but during the rule of his wife Sujanbai he superseded the former in power. Soon he was driven out and approached the French for help. Meanwhile, the cunning court-official Sayid imprisoned Sujanbai and impaled her favorite minister Siddoji thereby enabling Katturaja to take power in 1738. Reign Katturaja ascended the throne as Sawai Shahuji or Shahuji II and ruled for about a year. In February 1739, Chanda Sahib forced the Raja to cede Karaikal to the French and in April 1739, Shahuji II confirmed the grant. However, in July 1739, Shahuji II tried his best to prevent the French from landing in Karaikal. This alienated the French. Shahuji II approached the Dutch of Negapatam and the English of Fort St David for help but to no avail. Chanda Sahib invaded Thanjavur and deposed the Raja on the basis of the new discovery that Katturaja was the son of a washerwoman at the Fort and not the queen herself. With Thanjavur in the enemy's hands, there was no ruler in Thanjavur. Pratapsingh was reluctant to lay his claim on the throne. However, Katturaja exhorted him to lead from the front. He wrote a letter to Pratapsingh: Pratapsingh accepted Shahuji II's request and ascended the throne in 1739. Later life Shahuji II lived for a fair part of Pratapsingh's reign. During the early part of Pratapsingh's reign, he intrigued along with Chanda Sahib, Koyyaji Kattigai and the powerful court-official Sayyid in order to capture the throne.

While in her mid-30s, Shoman was appointed to Chair the Board of Directors of Belize Telecommunications Limited (1998‚Äì2000). In December 2009, she was elevated to the rank of Senior Counsel by the Chief Justice of Belize, Dr Abdulai Conteh. Her first national appointment came in 2000 when she became Ambassador/Permanent Representative of Belize to the Organization of American States on August 25, 2000, and she served concurrently as High Commissioner of Belize to Canada until 2003. She was also appointed Belize‚Äôs Ambassador to the United States in August 2000. During her tenure, Shoman served as Vice-Chair of the Permanent Council of the OAS. In June 2007, then Prime Minister Said Musa appointed her to the Senate, and made her the country‚Äôs first female Minister of Foreign Affairs & Foreign Trade. Shoman held this position until Musa‚Äôs party, the People's United Party, ceded power in 2008, when she returned to private practice. Shoman has remained an active advocate, heading the legal team challenging controversial Constitutional changes proposed by the ruling United Democratic Party. When Prime Minister Dean Barrow alleged that his predecessor, Said Musa had secretly diverted public funds and charged him with theft, Shoman was on the legal team that ensured Musa‚Äôs acquittal. Leader of the Opposition Johnny Brice√±o appointed Shoman as a senator for a second time in 2009. Personal life In 2009, Shoman married Caribbean writer Joey Clarke.

NTM also broadcast drama serials including Kashkol, Chand Grihan, Dasht, \\"French Toast\\", series of telefilms \\"Tapal Cinema\\" and Nadan Nadia. In 1994, NTM launched the first ever pop chart show in the history of Pakistani media industry 'Music Channel Charts'. The pop chart show was directed and produced by Yasir Akhtar and executive producer Ghazanfer Ali. MCC launched the careers of Najam Sheraz, Shehzad Roy, Fakhar- e-Alam, Komal Rizvi, Nadeem Jafri, Sequencers, Collage, Fringe Benefits, Jazba and many more artists. Yasir Akhtar produced and directed more than 60 music videos of different artists who appeared in the show. After Music Channel Charts, Pepsi Cola started a show with NTM called 'Pepsi Top of the Pops' which similar to the concept of 'Music Channel Charts'. In 1995, NTM started the first ever musical drama serial of Pakistan 'French Toast'. Frech Toast was based on a life of a musical band. The drama serial was in total of 7 episodes and it was directed and produced by Yasir Akhtar. In 1995, NTM started another project, a new trend of musical telefilms 'Tapal Cinema'. The series was in total of six telefilms namely Rahain, Titlee, Shehzadi, Zehar, Chand and Kashish. The project was directed and produced by Yasir Akhtar. The approximate duration of each film was 90 minutes and had different storylines. This series of films launched the careers of Humayun Saeed, Shamoon Abbasi, Javeria Abbasi, Zubair Abbasi and more. In 1990, STN's broadcasting hours from 7:00 to 11:00 pm daily and 6:00 to 11:00 pm on Saturdays and Sundays were purchased by NTM.

The loss of the water component of body fluid is specifically termed dehydration.MedicineNet > Definition of Dehydration Retrieved on July 2, 2009 By body fluid compartment Volume contraction is more or less a loss of extracellular fluid (ECF) and/or intracellular fluid (ICF). =ECF volume contraction= Volume contraction of extracellular fluid is directly coupled to and almost proportional to volume contraction of blood plasma, which is termed hypovolemia.MedicineNet > Definition of Hypovolemia Retrieved on July 2, 2009TheFreeDictionary.com --> hypovolemia Citing Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, 3 ed. Retrieved on July 2, 2009 Thus, it primarily affects the circulatory system, potentially causing hypovolemic shock. ECF volume contraction or hypovolemia is usually the type of volume contraction of primary concern in emergency, since ECF is approximately half the volume of ICF and is the first to be affected in e.g. bleeding. Volume contraction is sometimes even used synonymously with hypovolemia. =ICF volume contraction= Volume contraction of intracellular fluid may occur after substantial fluid loss, since it is much larger than ECF volume, or loss of potassium (K+) see section below. ICF volume contraction may cause disturbances in various organs throughout the body. =Dependence on lost solutes= Na+ loss approximately correlates with fluid loss from ECF, since Na+ has a much higher concentration in ECF than ICF. In contrast, K+ has a much higher concentration in ICF than ECF, and therefore its loss rather correlates with fluid loss from ICF, since K+ loss from ECF causes the K+ in ICF to diffuse out of the cells, dragging water with it by osmosis. =Estimation= When the body loses fluids, the amount lost from ICF and ECF, respectively, can be estimated by measuring volume and amount of substance of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) in the lost fluid, as well as estimating the body composition of the person. 1\\\\. To calculate an estimation, the total amount of substance in the body before the loss is first estimated: n_b = Osm_b \\\\times TBW_b where: *nb = Total amount of substance before fluid loss *Osmb = Body osmolarity before loss (almost equal to plasma osmolality of 275-299 milli-osmoles per kilogram) *TBWb = Total body water before loss (approximately 60% of body weight, or using tritiated water or deuterium) 2\\\\. The total amount of substance in the body after the loss is then estimated: n_a = n_b - n_{lost Na^+} - n_{lost K^+} where: *na = Total amount of substance after fluid loss *nb = Total amount of substance before fluid loss *nlost Na+ = Amount of substance of lost sodium *nlost K+ = Amount of substance of lost potassium 3\\\\. The new osmolarity becomes: Osm_a = \\\\frac{n_a}{TBW_b - V_{lost}} where: *Osma = Body osmolarity after loss *na = Total amount of substance after fluid loss *TBWb = Total body water before loss *Vlost = Volume of lost fluid 4\\\\. This osmolarity is evenly distributed in the body, and is used to estimate the new volumes of ICF and ECF, respectively: V_{ICF a} = \\\\frac{n_{ICF a}}{Osm_a} = \\\\frac{V_{ICF b} \\\\times Osm_b - n_{lost K^+}}{Osm_a} where: *VICF a = Intracellular fluid volume after fluid loss *nICF a = Amount of substance in ICF after fluid loss *Osma = Body osmolarity after loss *VICF b = Intracellular fluid volume before fluid loss (approximately 40% of body weight, or subtracting ECF from TBW) *Osmb = Body osmolarity before loss (almost equal to plasma osmolality of 275-299 milli-osmoles per kilogram) *nlost K+ = Amount of substance of lost potassium In homologous manner: V_{ECF a} = \\\\frac{n_{ECF a}}{Osm_a} = \\\\frac{V_{ECF b} \\\\times Osm_b - n_{lost Na^+}}{Osm_a} where: *VECF a = Extracellular fluid volume after fluid loss *nECF a = Amount of substance in ECF after fluid loss *VECF b = Extracellular fluid volume before fluid loss (approximately 20% of body weight, or by using inulin) *Osmb = Body osmolarity before loss (almost equal to plasma osmolality of 275-299 milli-osmoles per kilogram) *nlost K+ = Amount of substance of lost potassium 5\\\\.

Playing career =West Bromwich Albion= McLeod was born in Kilsyth, North Lanarkshire. After representing Kilsyth & Kirkintillock Schools and Westburn FC, he turned professional with Partick Thistle in April 1889. He made 38 cup and friendly appearances, scoring 9 goals, before moving to England in January 1891 to join West Bromwich Albion for a ¬£50 fee. He made his debut the following month against Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup third round. His arrival at Stoney Lane came too late to prevent Albion finishing the 1890‚Äì91 season at the foot of the table and having to apply for re-election to the Football League. He started the following season with two goals in the opening match against Everton, but the remainder of the league season was again disappointing as Albion finished 12th (out of 14). In the FA Cup, however, Albion enjoyed great success reaching the final after a drawn out semi-final against Nottingham Forest which went to three matches, with the second replay (won 6‚Äì2) taking place in a snowstorm. In the Final against Aston Villa, played at Kennington Oval on 19 March 1892, Albion's Cup experience proved the difference between the two Midlands sides. McLeod's cross to Jasper Geddes set up Albion's first goal, and Albion finished 3‚Äì0 victors, with the other goals coming from Sammy Nicholls and Jack Reynolds. In the next season, McLeod was ever-present and finished with ten league goals as Albion finished mid-table. In the following season McLeod scored in each of the first three matches. He continued to score regularly throughout the season, including a hat-trick on 27 December 1893 in an 8‚Äì0 victory at Wolverhampton Wanderers, to finish the season as top scorer with fourteen league goals. McLeod retained his place alongside Billy Bassett in the heart of Albion's forward line for the 1894‚Äì95 season. Again this was disappointing in the league (finishing 13th out of 16), but Albion again reached the FA Cup Final for the fifth time. The final itself was disappointing with Aston Villa's defence dominating throughout as Villa avenged their defeat three years earlier, running out the victors with the only goal being credited to Bob Chatt who scored the fastest goal in FA Cup history, scored after just 30 seconds. The 1895‚Äì96 season was again disappointing with Albion finishing at the bottom of the table. McLeod was top scorer (jointly with William Richards) with a meagre six goals. West Bromwich came through the end of season \\"test matches\\" to retain the place in the First Division. Despite Albion's poor form in the two preceding seasons, their directors retained most of the same team for 1896‚Äì97. McLeod was once again on target for the opening match (a 2‚Äì1 success at Blackburn Rovers), but this early-season promise was not fulfilled and Albion again struggled finishing in 12th position with McLeod only managing to contribute four goals. In his seven seasons with West Bromwich Albion, McLeod made 169 appearances in all competitions and scored 57 goals. =Leicester Fosse and Brighton= In the summer of 1897 McLeod moved to spend a season with Leicester Fosse, where he was top scorer for 1897‚Äì98 with 13 league goals. A tempting offer from Brighton United then persuaded him to move to the south coast in May 1898 to join them in the Southern League. He scored on his debut for Brighton with the consolation goal in a 4‚Äì1 defeat in the opening match at Southampton's newly built stadium, The Dell. Despite being Brighton's top scorer, the club's financial troubles forced them to release McLeod from his contract in April 1899. =Southampton= McLeod was persuaded to remain in the Southern League with Southampton and played the final three matches of their 1898‚Äì99 Southern League championship season. Described by Holley & Chalk as \\"baby-faced and small in stature\\" he was \\"a splendid forward who had the ability to turn a game by using his deft footwork\\". He retained his place for the start of the following season but after the first five matches, in which he failed to score, he lost his place to Archie Turner. McLeod eventually regained his place in the side in January and for the remainder of the season he vied with Jack Farrell for the No. 9 shirt. He replaced the injured Farrell in an FA Cup match against Newcastle United in which he scored twice in a 4‚Äì1 victory. He followed this with the winning goal in the next round in a 2‚Äì1 victory over his former club, West Bromwich Albion. McLeod also found his goal-scoring form in the league with a run of three goals in three matches at the start of April 1900, but lost his place in the FA Cup side to Farrell. Saints reached the FA Cup Final for the first time in their history, but failed dismally on the day going down 4‚Äì0 to Bury. Saints' failure in the final was later attributed to a dispute between the players, with the Scottish players wanting McLeod to play whereas the English players, and the board, went for Farrell, despite Farrell being off-form, having failed to score in any competition since January. =After Southampton= Understandably disappointed he moved to join Brentford in August 1900, helping them take the Southern League Second Division title in 1901. He remained at Brentford until finally retiring from professional football in 1906. He subsequently fell on hard times, and in March 1911 Southampton made an appeal on his behalf for employment as a warehouseman. He later worked in a brewery and then as a boiler mechanic in London. He died in Lambeth in December 1931.

Wing and exhaust in detail from the Mazda Furai on display at the 2008 Canadian International Auto Show The Furai, meaning \\"sound of the wind\\", was the fifth and last of the Nagare line of concept cars that have been made by Mazda since 2006. The chassis was based on the Courage Comp√©tition C65 Le Mans Prototype that Mazda last used to compete in the American Le Mans Series, two seasons previously and was designed to use E100 ethanol fuel, it was powered by a heavily modified 20B 3-rotor wankel engine that produces . The engine was developed and built by renowned rotary tuner, Racing Beat, who also built the car's rotary-shaped muffler canister. The car wore the number 55, that of its 24 Hours of Le Mans-winning ancestor, the 787B. Unlike many concept cars, the Furai was fully functional and was tested at various tracks. It ran at Laguna Seca and Buttonwillow. The head designer, Laurens van den Acker, had stated in an interview with Top Gear magazine that there would have been possibilities of the Furai being used for racing in Le Mans, and he also had strong hopes that the car could be brought to the market. The Mazda Furai also appears as a playable vehicle in various video game series such as Real Racing 3, Gran Turismo, Forza,http://www.forzamotorsport.net/enus/games/fm4/cars/mazda GRID, Asphalt and GT Racing. Additionally, a die-cast toy of the car has been made by Hot Wheels. 2008 accident In September 2013, it was revealed that the car had been destroyed by fire during road tests by Top Gear in 2008. On November 29, 2013, Top Gear was given the opportunity to make the story about the Furai's demise public. It was explained that the vehicle caught fire during a photography session at Bentwaters Parks on August 19, 2008, at 11:52 am. Driver Mark Ticehurst was piloting the Furai when the engine bay caught fire while cresting a hill on the backside of the track. Ticehurst was able to escape the car before the fire spread to the cabin area. Due to the location of the accident, fire crews were initially unaware of the incident, and took several minutes to reach the Furai. By this time, the car was completely engulfed in flames. The fire took approximately eight minutes to extinguish, and the Furai was incinerated as a result. Although the car's remains were initially taken to Mazda's Advanced Design Studio in Irvine, California, the ultimate fate of the Furai's charred remains is not publicly known.

Campos (July 7, 1921 ‚Äì June 2, 2007) was a Filipino physician and educator noted for his promotion of wider community health care and his achievements in the field of nuclear medicine for which he was dubbed as \\"The Father of Nuclear Medicine in the Philippines\\". The first president of the National Academy of Science and Technology, he was conferred the rank and title of National Scientist of the Philippines in 1988. Early life and education Campos was born in Dasmari√±as, Cavite, on July 27, 1921. His younger brother was Jose C. Campos Court of Appeals of the Philippines Associate Justice of the Philippine Supreme Court.De Guzman-Dizon, Dr. Campos is included in the roster of National Scientists of the Philippines, p. 148. Having graduated as valedictorian of his elementary and high school class, Campos enrolled at University of the Philippines. He also took up his medical school at the university. He then took his postgraduate studies at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the Harvard School of Medicine, and Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies.  Contributions to medicine  Throughout the 1950s, Campos would pursue graduate studies in the United States; particularly at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and at the Medical Division of the Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies.De Guzman-Dizon, National Scientists of the Philippines, p.142 He developed an interest in nuclear medicine while at Johns Hopkins, and completed a training course on the field at Oak Ridge.De Guzman-Dizon, National Scientists of the Philippines, p. 142-143. Two years after his return to the Philippines in 1958, he was named as the head of the Department of Medicine of the University of the Philippines, and concurrently, the head of the department's Research Laboratories. As head of the Department of Medicine, Campos established the first Medical Research Laboratory in the Philippines at the U.P. College of Medicine. The facility, considered as the country's premier research laboratory in the 1960s, furthered research in fields such as epidemiology, physiology and biology. =Nuclear medicine= Campos initiated the construction of the first [radionuclideradioisotope] laboratory in the Philippines. With funding provided by the International Atomic Energy Authority and other Philippine institutions,De Guzman-Dizon, National Scientists of the Philippines, p.143 the laboratory was established at the Philippine General Hospital. As a result, it was made possible for the first time in the country to conduct such procedures as the basal metabolism test and radioactive iodine therapy De Guzman-Dizon, National Scientists of the Philippines, p.141 At the clinic, and with funding from the IAEA and later, the World Health Organization, Campos conducted considerable research on goiter, a common medical problem in the Philippines. His team first suggested the injection of iodized oil (see poppyseed oil) to goiter patients, a treatment later advocated by the WHO. Through the thyroid clinic, Campos likewise pursued research on whether there was a genetic factor that contributed to endemic goiter. His findings, as contained in a paper that he published in 1961,The Genetic Factor in Endemic Goiter, In Proceedings of the Mexico Conference on the Uses of Radioisotopes in Animal Biology and the Medical Sciences, Mexico City (B.S. Baltazar, N. Grabato, L.T. Moya & A. Clemente, co-authors). See De Guzman-Dizon, National Scientists of the Philippines, p.152 proposed that the iodine intake deficiency thought to be the main cause of goiter was just one of the triggering factors of the disease, and that physiology and anatomy proved to be more important considerations as some people were born without the enzyme necessary to take in trace elements such as iodine even if it were present in food and water.De Guzman-Dizon, National Scientists of the Philippines, p.144 =Community medical outreach= As chairman of the Department of Medicine, Campos began the practice of fielding medical interns for community service in Los Ba√±os, Laguna for one month a year. In 1963, the program was institutionalized through the organization of the Comprehensive Community Health Program (CCHP), pursuant to an agreement between the University of the Philippines and the Department of Health. The CCHP, which was based in Bay, Laguna, served as a community health center that serviced several towns in Laguna. Until its closure in 1989, it became the community laboratory of the UP College of Medicine, and it was there that Campos conducted testing on the use of iodized oil for the treatment of goiter.De Guzman-Dizon, National Scientists of the Philippines, p. 144-45 Campos also founded a hospital in Ermita, Manila, the Medical Center Manila, where he executed several of his ideas relative to health care in urbanized centers. Educator In addition to his service at the University of the Philippines, Campos was also affiliated with the Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, which he and his family also managed. Appointed as the president of the college in 1973, he oversaw the establishment in 1977 of a second campus in Dasmari√±as, Cavite. The ownership and management of the Dasmari√±as campus was sold by the Campos family in 1987 to the De La Salle University, which integrated it into the La Salle system as what is now known as the De La Salle University-Dasmari√±as.De Guzman-Dizon, National Scientists of the Philippines, p. 145. The Campos family retained control over the Manila campus of what is now the Emilio Aguinaldo College, a partner-institution of the Medical Center Manila. Despite his involvement with the Emilio Aguinaldo College, Campos maintained his ties with the University of the Philippines. He was named professor emeritus of the university and appointed a member of its board of regents in 1994.

It operates Boeing C-17 Globemaster III aircraft supporting the United States Air Force global reach mission worldwide. Mission Train and equip Boeing C-17 Globemaster III aircrews for global airland and airdrop operations. History =Initial organization= The squadron's origins date to 1 October 1933 when it was constituted as the 8th Transport Squadron and assigned to the 2d Transport Group in the Fifth Corps Area in inactive status. The unit became a Regular Army Inactive unit when reserve personnel were assigned to it in June 1938 at Patterson Field, Ohio.Regular Army Inactive units were units that were constituted in the regular army. Although they were not activated, they were organized with reserve personnel during the 1920s and early 1930s. Even though they had reserve personnel assigned, they were not Organized Reserve units. Because they had no regular personnel they were still considered inactive in the regular army. Clay, p. vi On 1 February 1940, these reserve personnel were withdrawn and the squadron was activated at Brooks Field, Texas, and assigned to the 10th Transport Group. Once organized it moved to nearby Duncan Field where it became a transport squadron for supplies and equipment managed by the San Antonio Air Depot. It moved on 29 June 1941 to Hill Field, Utah where it performed the same mission for the Ogden Air Depot.Clay =World War II= After the Pearl Harbor Attack, the squadron was transferred to the 62d Troop Carrier Group and re-equipped with Douglas C-47 Skytrain transports. Transferred to Kellogg Field, Michigan, the squadron trained for combat resupply and casualty evacuation mission at several airfields during the spring and summer of 1942. The 8th deployed to England, where it became part of Eighth Air Force in September 1942. Performed intratheater transport flights of personnel, supply and equipment within England during summer and fall of 1942, reassigned to Twelfth Air Force after Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa, and moved to Tafaraoui Airfield, Algeria. In combat, the squadron performed resupply and evacuation missions across Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia during the North African Campaign. During June 1943, the unit began training with gliders in preparation for Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily. It towed gliders to Syracuse, Sicily and dropped paratroopers at Catania during the operation. After moving to Sicily, the squadron airdropped supplies to escaped prisoners of war in Northern Italy in October. It operated from Sicily until December until moving to the Italian mainland in December. The squadron supported the Italian Campaign during balance of 1944 supporting partisans in the Balkans. Its unarmed aircraft flew at night over uncharted territory, landing at small unprepared airfields to provide guns, ammunition, clothing, medical supplies, gasoline, and mail to the partisans. It even carried jeeps and mules as cargo. On return trips it evacuated wounded partisans, evadees and escaped prisoners. It carried paratroopers during Operation Dragoon, the invasion of Southern France in August 1944. The squadron then returned to operations over Italy and in the Balkans until the end of combat in Europe, May 1945. =Cold War= The squadron returned to the United States in September 1946, being assigned to the troop carrier squadron training school at Bergstrom Field, Texas. When the school closed in July 1947, it moved to McChord Field, Washington where its parent 62d Troop Carrier Wing became the host unit at the airfield after reorganizing under the wing base organization system. It conducted routine peacetime transport operations, training with Army units at Fort Lewis with simulated combat parachute training drops flying Curtiss C-46 Commandos and the new Fairchild C-82 Packet combat cargo aircraft, designed to operate from forward, rugged airfields. It deployed to Alaska in September 1947 where it flew airlift missions from Elmendorf Field during the winter of 1947‚Äì1948, returning to McChord in March 1948. In October 1949 it received the long- distance Douglas C-54 Skymaster. On 1 June 1950, its parent 62d Wing was inactivated, while the 62d Troop Carrier Group, less the 4th Troop Carrier Squadron moved for a short time to Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, returning in July. During the Korean War, the squadron flew long, over-water trans-Pacific missions to Japan from McChord. In 1951, it upgraded to the new Douglas C-124 Globemaster II strategic airlifter. It moved to nearby Larson Air Force Base when McChord was taken over by Air Defense Command in 1952. From Larson, the squadron airlifted troops, blood plasma, aircraft parts, ammunition, medical supplies, and much more, primarily to Japan, in support of the Korean War until the armistice in June 1953. During the balance of the 1950s, the squadron supported the French forces in French Indochina, transporting a replacement French garrison to Dien Bien Phu in 1954. By 1955 the Cold War was well under way, and the North American Air Defense Command set out to build a chain of radar stations on the northernmost reaches of the continent. This chain of radars, known as the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW Line), was to detect incoming Soviet missiles and bombers, and give American forces enough warning to launch a counterattack, and get the National Command Authorities to safety. Between 1955 and 1957, the squadron began to fly missions to the Alaskan arctic regions, carrying 13 million pounds of supplies and equipment to build the DEW Line. The resupply of the DEW Line stations kept the squadron occupied until 1969. Its Globemasters also flew airlift missions in South Vietnam as the growing American commitment required more troops, supplies and equipment. =Vietnam War= In a realignment of assets, the squadron's parent 62d Troop Carrier Wing moved back to McChord in June 1960. During the early 1960s, the squadron found itself back in Indochina by April 1962. At a time when overt American participation in the war in Vietnam was minimized, the squadron began carrying Army supplies and equipment from Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, to Saigon, South Vietnam. The next month, the squadron participated in Operation Spare Bed, airlifting an Army field hospital to a classified location in Thailand. During the 1960s the aircraft of the squadron found themselves almost continually supporting United States military missions in South Vietnam as the growing American commitment required more troops, supplies and equipment. The squadron was upgraded to the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter intercontinental jet transport in 1966 flying troops and supplies regularly to Tan Son Nhut, Cam Ranh Bay and Da Nang Air Bases in South Vietnam, as well as Clark Air Base in the Philippines and Don Muang Airport in Thailand, among others. With the ending of the United States involvement in the Vietnam War in the early 1970s, the squadron flew missions in support of Operation Homecoming, the return of prisoners of war from Vietnam in early 1973. Missions were flown to Hanoi, North Vietnam to pick up the Prisoners and transport them to Clark Air Base. Subsequently, they were flown back to the United States, to return to their waiting families. In March 1975, with the fall of South Vietnam imminent, the squadron returned to Saigon one last time during Operation Babylift, which carried hundreds of Vietnamese orphans to the United States, where adoptive parents awaited their arrival. =Return to peacetime support= During the 1970s, the squadron returned to a peacetime status, with routine flights around the world carrying personnel, equipment and supplies as needed. This was interrupted in 1978 following the mass murder-suicide of more than 900 people at the Jonestown religious compound in Guyana, South America. The squadron airlifted bodies to a morgue at Dover Air Force Base (most of the victims were U.S. Citizens). Crew members reported using their oxygen masks during the flight, in an effort to stifle the stench of decaying bodies in the cargo compartment. In 1980, the squadron began to exchange its Lockheed C-141A Starlifters for newer, \\"stretched\\" C-141B models. This new version of the aircraft increased its cargo carrying capacity by inserting two fuselage plugs, one forward, one aft of the wings, totaling just over 23 feet in length. The B series modification also added an air refueling receptacle, giving yet longer range to the C-141. =Desert Storm= In August 1990, totalitarian Iraq invaded Kuwait, on the shores of the Persian Gulf. Within days the squadron began flying missions to the Middle East as part of Operation Desert Shield, the effort to deter further aggression from Iraq. The operation's tempo was unprecedented. By January 1991, Desert Shield became Desert Storm, as allied air power was unleashed upon the invaders with irresistible force. The squadron joined the rest of the Military Airlift Command in providing round-the-clock airlift to the Middle East, keeping the air war supplied, and aiding the buildup of ground forces for the highly successful, though brief ground war in February. Before long, Kuwait was free, although the tremendous effort put forth by the squadron had accelerated the aging process of its C-141s. The increased payloads and almost incessant flying would have lasting negative effects on the fleet. =Recent operations= In early 1992, squadron crews and aircraft began participating in Operation Provide Hope, helping to deliver hundreds of tons of food and medicine to the former Soviet Union. By August; Operation Provide Relief (later known as Operation Restore Hope), rushing food supplies to the starving people of Somalia; the relief of victims of Hurricane Andrew in America, and relief efforts for the Guamanian victims of typhoon Omar kept our crews and aircraft on the move. In late 1995, President Bill Clinton ordered the deployment of 20,000 U.S. troops to the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia, as part of a multinational peacekeeping force. Squadron aircraft were deployed to Rhein-Main Air Base, Germany, by 18 December. In spite of severe weather conditions, crews and aircraft were soon flying troops and equipment into Taszar Air Base, Hungary, for Operation Joint Endeavor. In January 1996 the squadron, operating under a provisional wing located at Rhein-Main, continued supporting airlift missions into Tuzla and Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzogovina, and Taszar in support of Operation Joint Endeavor. In April 1996, the squadron provided equipment and personnel transportation in support of an airpower expeditionary force in the Middle Eastern Kingdom of Jordan as part of Operation Southern Watch. On the night of 15 May 1996, aircrews took part in Big Drop III, the largest airdrop since World War II. The squadron helped deploy members of the Army 82nd Airborne Division, U.K. 5th Airborne Brigade personnel, and their heavy equipment onto three drop zones on Fort Bragg, North Carolina. A humanitarian mission included the deliverance of relief supplies from Kadena Air Base, Japan to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam after Typhoon Linda devastated the area in early November 1997. The typhoon unleashed torrential rains and winds that wiped out coastal villages, killed hundreds of people and left thousands homeless. In 2000, the squadron retired its Starlifters for the new Boeing C-17 Globemaster III airlifter. In a response to the terrorist attacks against America on 11 September 2001, President George W. Bush initiated war against terrorism named Operation Infinite Justice, later renamed Operation Enduring Freedom. The squadron supported these efforts by airlifting troops and supplies destined for Afghanistan. It also flew humanitarian airdrops that hundreds of thousands of the rations for starving Afghans. Flights in support of Coalition efforts in Afghanistan continue to the present day.McChord Air Museum, 2000 to 2010 In January 2003 additional personnel and aircraft would deploy to locations all around the world in support airlift operations. By the end of January all aircraft supporting this effort would fly their missions from Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina, the only east coast C-17 Base. Similar C-17 stage operations had been operating into Afghanistan from a base in Germany. After repeated noncompliance to UN demands Operation Iraqi Freedom began. \\"On my orders, coalition forces have begun striking selected targets of military importance to undermine Saddam Hussein's ability to wage war,\\" President Bush stated in an address to the nation. Under the cover of darkness at a forward operation location at Aviano Air Base, Italy on 26 March 2003, squadron aircraft flew into combat in Northern Iraq. The nine-hour mission, covering distance roughly the equivalent of Seattle to St. Louis, delivered members of the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade into an area north of Baghdad. This mission, the largest combat airdrop since the invasion of Panama in December 1989 in Operation Just Cause, was the first combat insertion of paratroopers using C-17's. Operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom continued until the United States withdraw from Iraq at the end of 2011.

To the south of the Tungabhadra River, it is considered sacred by Hindus and is one of the five sacred ', or lakes in India. According to Hindu theology, there are five sacred lakes; collectively called Panch Sarovar; Mansarovar, Bindu Sarovar, Narayan Sarovar, Pampa Sarovar and Pushkar Sarovar. They are also mentioned in Shrimad Bhagavata Purana. Encyclopaedia of tourism resources in India, Volume 2 By Manohar Sajnani In Hindu scriptures Pampa Sarovar is regarded as the place where Pampa, a form of Shiva's consort Parvati, performed penance to show her devotion to Shiva. It is also one of the Sarovar's that finds a mention in the Hindu epic, Ramayana as the place where Shabari, a devotee of Rama waited for the arrival of Ram. Description The Pampa Sarovar lake is located in a valley, hidden among the hills on the road to Anegundi from Hospet. It is about a kilometer from the foothills of the Hanuman Temple. The lake is filled with lotuses, and is really picturesque when the flowers are in bloom. There is a Lakshmi temple, as well as a Shiva temple facing the pond. Next to the pond, under a mango tree stands a small Ganesh shrine. Related Scriptural Reference In the Ramayana, Pampa Sarovar is mentioned as the place where Shabari (also Shabri), a disciple of the Rishi Matanga, directed Rama as he journeyed southwards on his quest to redeem Sita, his wife, from the demon King Ravana. According to the story, Shabari, a pious devotee of Rama, prayed faithfully everyday to see Rama. She lived in the ashram of her Guru Matanga in the place now known as Matanga Parvat in Hampi. Before her Guru Matanga Rishi died he told her she would certainly see Rama. After his death, Shabari continued to live in the ashram awaiting Rama. Many years passed by and Shabari became an old woman and finally Lord Rama came to the place and stopped at the ashram on his journey to Lanka. She proceeded to feed Rama and his brother Lakshmana. Touched by her piety Rama and Lakshmana bowed down at her feet. Then, they narrated to her the incident of Sita's kidnapping and Shabari suggested that they seek help from Hanuman and Sugriva of the monkey kingdom who lived further south near the Pampa lake. Lord Rama took sacred bath in Matanga Lake.

Lymphangiography is the same procedure, used only to visualize the lymph vessels. The X-ray film or image of the vessels and nodes is called a lymphogram or a lymphangiogram. Radiographs can be taken after injection of a radiopaque contrast medium into small lymphatic vessels (these are made visible by prior subcutaneous injection of patent blue dye). The resulting lymphogram is used to find the locations of large vessels and nodes, and to identify sites of blockage in lymphatic drainage. Lymph nodes can also be detected via radionuclide imaging after injection of radioactive colloids. Macrophages phagocytose these foreign bodies and sequester in the nodes.  Procedure  * A needle or catheter inserted into a lymphatic channel in either the foot or arm, and a contrast medium is injected into the body at a very slow rate (approximately 60 to 90 minutes for all the contrast medium to be injected). * A fluoroscope is used to follow the dye as it spreads through the lymphatic system through the legs, into the groin, and along the back of the abdominal cavity. * Once the contrast medium is injected, the catheter is removed, and the incisions are stitched and bandaged. X-rays are taken of the legs, pelvis, abdomen, and chest areas. The next day, another set of X-rays may be taken. * If a site of cancer (breast or melanoma) is being studied to evaluate spreading, a mixture of blue dye and a radioactive tracer is injected next to the mass. Special cameras detect the spread of tracer along lymph channels to outlying nodes. * A surgeon will then use the visible blue dye or radioactivity within nodes to guide biopsy within adjacent tissues (such as the arm pit for breast cancer) to determine possible routes of cancer spread. Use This test is not used as often as it once was, because of the adoption of CT scan and the PET scan technologies.

Hill. The film follows a Marine recruit and the sergeant who trains him. It was the biggest box office success of Chaney's career and the second biggest moneymaker of 1926/1927.Eames, John Douglas, The MGM Story, 1981 In April 2012 the film became available on DVD from the Warner Archive collection. Plot In 1924, \\"Skeet\\" Burns applies to join the United States Marine Corps, but only to get a free train ride to San Diego, California. When he arrives, he escapes from veteran Marine Sergeant O'Hara and boards another train to \\"Tia Juana\\", Mexico for the horse races. However, upon his return, he enlists after all and comes under O'Hara's charge. At the base, Skeet spots Norma Dale, an attractive Navy nurse. He tries to become better acquainted with her, but his unsubtle, overconfident approach meets with a cold reception. He also discovers that O'Hara is smitten with Norma as well. It becomes clear to O'Hara that Norma does like Skeet when she asks him to take Skeet along on a sea training cruise despite his unsatisfactory performance and attitude. She finds he has already done so. On board ship, Skeet picks a fight with a \\"gob\\", a sailor, unaware that his intended victim is actually the Navy heavyweight champion. O'Hara and his men are assigned to Tondo Island, a dreary naval station described as being \\"six miles this side of Hell\\". There, he is tempted by Zaya, a pretty native who is attracted to him. Before things get too serious however, he changes his mind. When she tries to hold onto him, he has to untangle himself from her. This results in a brawl with the outraged locals in which O'Hara has to rescue Skeet. Hearing unflattering gossip about the affair, Norma writes Skeet a letter breaking off their relationship. Skeet mistakenly believes O'Hara told her about the incident in order to improve his own romantic chances with Norma. The Marines are relieved and are sent to join the Asiatic Squadron, stationed at Shanghai, China. O'Hara and Skeet find Norma there where is she is serving on a Navy hospital ship; she greets the sergeant warmly, but refuses to give Skeet a second chance. She and other nurses are then sent to Hangchow to deal with an epidemic. When news arrives that a bandit army is threatening the city, the Marines are ordered to the rescue. During the tense evacuation, O'Hara and his men are chosen to be the rear guard at a bridge. Fierce fighting breaks out. When O'Hara is wounded, he orders Skeet to rejoin the column, but Skeet refuses to obey. The detachment is saved by the timely arrival of an aerial squadron. After his four-year enlistment ends, Skeet and Norma buy a ranch, in which Skeet offers O'Hara a partnership. However, the old veteran declines, saying that he and the Marine Corps are made for each other.

Kains as Harry (as Maurice Kains) Background The film premiered in New York City on December 23, 1926. MGM brought in General Smedley D. Butler, commander of the Marine base in San Diego and subsequently the author of the anti-war book War Is a Racket, for technical consultation on the film. Lon Chaney formed a close friendship with the Marine Corps general which lasted for the rest of Chaney's life. A writer in Leatherneck Magazine wrote that \\"few of us who observed Chaney's portrayal of his role were not carried away to the memory of some sergeant we had known whose behavior matched that of the actor in every minute detail ...\\" For his role in the film, Chaney became the first film star chosen to be an honorary Marine. The studio was also allowed to shoot on the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego which made Tell It to the Marines the first motion picture made with the full cooperation of the U.S. Marine Corps. Battleship (later involved in the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941) was used for the scenes at sea and the final sequence of the film, where the Marines rescue the hostages, was filmed at Iverson Ranch in Chatsworth, California, the location for such films as Fort Apache and The Good Earth. The film was shot concurrently with Path√©'s film serial The Fighting Marine with Gene Tunney and Fox's What Price Glory? leading MGM and Fox to bicker over which studio had rights to use the name of the U.S. Marine Corps.Blake, Michael Francis A Thousand Faces: Lon Chaney's Unique Artistry in Motion Pictures Vestal Press 1995 The films began a genre of films depicting the Marines fighting putting down insurrections around the world until RKO's The Marines Fly High (1940) when World War II exploits became the norm.

It was created, hosted and sponsored by Red Bull. The program usually aired after the Chick-fil-A Bowl (around 11pm) until 1am Eastern Time. 2007 The 2007 version originated from the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. Joe Tessitore, Mark Schlereth, Cam Steele, and Jamie Little were the commentators. On this show, freestyle motocross rider Robbie Maddison set a new world record for the longest jump on a motorcycle, jumping 322 feet, 7¬Ω inches. He then made a second attempt, largely because his personal goal was 360 feet. He failed in that attempt, and in fact the second jump was slightly shorter. Maddison jumped above a makeshift football field set up in the Rio's parking lot, which was used to provide a perspective of the distance. The show was also scheduled to feature the first-ever backflip in an off-road truck, performed by Rhys Millen, best known for his skills as a drifting race car driver. However, he suffered a back injury in his final warm-up jump when the truck overshot safety barriers. Millen did speak to Schlereth by telephone. In the original plan, Maddison was to have jumped shortly after midnight ET and Millen's flip was set for 3a.m. ET. However, because of the overtime finish of the Chick- fil-A Bowl that preceded it, and as a safety precaution due to headwinds at the site, Maddison did not jump until approximately 12:45 a.m. (9:45 p.m. Dec. 31 in Las Vegas). SportsCenter, which was set as interstitial programming, then followed at 1:10 a.m. ET and was re-run in its entirety in place of the canceled Millen stunt. Angels and Airwaves performed at the end of the show. Early promotions indicated that New Year No Limits was presented by MGM, the distributor of the upcoming mockumentary release The Poughkeepsie Tapes, though the sponsorship was dropped when MGM decided to shelve that film (which would not be released in any form until 2014). 2008 The 2008 New Year No Limits jump once again featured Maddison, and this time the off-road attempt to backflip a truck by Millen was once again on the plan, with the popular Kiwi racer on the docket on the undercard before the motorcycle jump. At 8:30pm PT, Millen performed the backflip on the truck, launching at 36 MPH, traveled 80 feet at a height of 50 feet, and landed hard on all four wheels before the truck then rolled. Shortly after the stroke of the new year in the Eastern Time Zone (about 35 minutes later), Maddison successfully connected on a ten-story-high jump, landing on top of a replica of the Arc de Triomphe at a Las Vegas casino. While that was successful, he lacerated his left hand on the ensuing 60-foot drop. 2009 The 2009 New Year No Limits moved west to Long Beach, California, where Travis Pastrana, a four-time Rally America champion and part-time WRC driver, jumped a Subaru Impreza STI rally car off the Pine Avenue pier, soaring 269 feet on Rainbow Harbor, and landed on a floating barge shortly after 9pm Pacific Time. He celebrated by hitting a back flip off the landing ramp into Rainbow Harbor. 2010 The 2010 New Year No Limits was planned to move to San Diego, California, where Levi LaVallee, a seven-time Winter X Games medalist and champion snocross racer, was to attempt to jump his Polaris snowmobile longer than ever before and eclipse the current record of 301 feet. The event would have taken place at the Embarcadero Marina Park in the Port of San Diego. Embarcadero is Spanish for ‚Äúlanding place,‚Äù making it an appropriate location for LaVallee‚Äôs jump.http://www.redbullusa.com/cs/Satellite/en_US/Article/levi-lavallee-new- year-no-limits-021242924451090 On Friday December 17, Red Bull officially announced that Levi Lavallee was injured during a practice run and would be unable to make his record setting attempt during the special telecast. As a result, there was no New Year, No Limits event for 2010. During the practice sessions leading up to the event Levi managed to land a record setting 361 foot jump shattering the old record of 301 feet. Since the official event for the attempt did not take place the practice run has been submitted for the official world record title.http://www.redbullusa.com/cs/Satellite/en_US/Article/new-year-no-limits- cancelled-021242938812071 An episode of SportsCenter aired in place of New Year No Limits. 2011 The 2011 edition of New Year No Limits featured LaVallee making a second attempt at crossing San Diego Bay while Robbie Maddison attempted to do the same on a motorcycle; the two attempts took place side-by-side. The event was televised on ESPN and was also broadcast on the Internet via ESPN3. LaVallee set a new World Record unofficially during his jump landing at a distance of 412 ft. Robbie Maddison landed his jump at 378 ft, 9 inches also an unofficial World Record, but short of his stated goal of 400 ft. Cancellation The program would not air in 2012 into 2013, and was effectively cancelled with the launch of the College Football Playoff on ESPN in 2014, which effectively monopolized New Year's Eve and New Year's Day with bowl programming rather than a need for counterprogramming.

It is found in the western Pacific, from the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan to Java and northwestern Australia.FishBase [2008] It grows to a maximum length of 20 cm (nearly 8 in).Dianne J. Bray, 2011, Philippine Butterflyfish, Chaetodon adiergastos, in Fishes of Australia, accessed 07 Oct 2014, http://www.fishesofaustralia.net.au/home/species/2372 The body is white with diagonal brown stripes on the sides. The dorsal, caudal, anal and pelvic fins are yellow. There are rounded broad black bands on the face, covering the eye, but not continuous from one side of the body to the other but with a separate black spot centered on the forehead. It belongs to the large subgenus Rabdophorus which might warrant recognition as a distinct genus. In this group, it appears to belong to a loose group including such species as the black butterflyfish (C. flavirostris), diagonal butterflyfish (C. fasciatus), raccoon butterflyfish (C. lunula) and perhaps also the unusual red-tailed butterflyfish (C. collare). Although the coloration of this group varies quite a lot, they are all largish butterflyfishes with an oval outline, and most have a pattern of ascending oblique stripes on the flanks. Except in the red- tailed butterflyfish, there is at least a vestigial form of the \\"raccoon\\" mask, with a white space between the dark crown and eye areas.Fessler & Westneat (2007), Hsu et al. (2007) The Philippine butterflyfish is found in coral reefs at depths of 1-30m and occurs in pairs or groups, usually near soft coral. Juveniles are solitary and found on shallow protected reefs or in estuaries.

Breen and Warren Duff. The drama features Alan Ladd, Phyllis Calvert, Paul Stewart, among others. Plot At the Hotel Compton in Gary, Indiana, U.S. postal inspector Harry Gruber is murdered by two men, Joe Regas (Jack Webb) and George Soderquist (Harry Morgan). They dump the body in La Porte during a rainstorm, but just then a nun, Sister Augustine (Phyllis Calvert), passes near them. Soderquist tries to distract her by helping unfurl her umbrella and pretending Gruber is drunk, but she reports the incident. Postal inspector Al Goddard (Alan Ladd) is assigned to the case. He traces Sister Augustine to a convent in Fort Wayne, and recites to her a quotation from Martin Luther about personal responsibility. She then agrees to go to the police station, where she identifies Soderquist from a mug book, and then to Gary in the hope of identifying him there in person. She will stay at a convent there until she is needed to testify in court. Soderquist is seen by Goddard and Sister Augustine with another gang member, Paul Ferrar (Stacy Harris), but gets away. Meanwhile Regas, who Mary does not recognize, sees her and telephones Earl Boettiger (Paul Stewart), the head of the gang and owner of the Hotel Compton, warning him to hide Soderquist; later, when Soderquist rejects an order to leave town, they kill him. Goddard realizes that since Soderquist has not left town, the gang must still be planning something. He talks to the Gary postmaster (Harry Antrim), who suggests a likely target for theft: a money shipment that arrives regularly at Gary by train but must change to another train, involving a 7-minute truck ride between stations. Gruber had asked him about the truck's drivers. One of them recently turned down a chance at a higher-paying job; it is Ferrar, and Goddard recognizes him from before. Goddard, posing as a corrupt inspector, pressures Ferrar to meet the head of the gang. He then asks Boettiger to join the gang, promising to be more a reliable inside man than Ferrar. The plan is indeed to steal the money shipment, expected to be worth $1 million. Meanwhile Regas is still worried about Sister Augustine and tries unsuccessfully to stage a fatal accident for her. When Boettiger makes a last-minute change to the plan, Goddard has no choice but to phone police from the gang's hotel suite. He is heard by Boettiger's mistress, hotel employee Dodie (Jan Sterling), but she protects him because she does not want to be an accessory to his murder. She \\"reports\\" the planned crime to him in order to stay on the right side of the law, and says she is leaving town at once. The robbery does not go as smoothly as hoped, because Regas neglects his part of the preparations in order to take Sister Augustine prisoner. When the gang meets, she blurts Goddard's name, revealing his deception. He pleads for them not to kill her, then buys time by starting a fight. As police arrive, this turns into a shoot-out in an industrial district, ending in the death of all the gang members. Cast * Alan Ladd as Al Goddard * Phyllis Calvert as Sister Augustine * Paul Stewart as Earl Boettiger * Jan Sterling as Dodie * Jack Webb as Joe Regas * Stacy Harris as Paul Ferrar * Harry Morgan as George Soderquist (credited as Henry Morgan) * David Bauer as David Goodman (as David Wolfe) * Dan Riss as Maury Ahearn * Geraldine Wall as Mother Ambrose * George J. Lewis as Leo Cronin * Paul Lees as Gene Gunner Background The film was announced in July 1948 as Postal Inspector. It was always envisioned as a vehicle for Alan Ladd. Ardel Wray and Robert L. Richards wrote the script and the film was meant to follow Chicago Deadline. However production was pushed back to allow Ladd to make Captain Carey, U.S.A.. The movie's title was changed to Dead Letter. William Keighley was originally announced as director, but then he was replaced by Lewis Allen. Phyllis Calvert was signed in April 1949. According to Calvert the studio did not think she would accept the part, as she had turned down several films before. They spent another six weeks rewriting the script.\\"Film: For love? Hell no, I did it for money Frustrated by the British studios, Phyllis Calvert went to Hollywood. What followed was even worse.\\" Sweet, Matthew, The Independent; London, 25 Feb 2000: 12. Filming started on 16 June. The title was changed again to United States Mail. The film features both Jack Webb and Harry Morgan as villains. Both would later work on the Dragnet television show as fictional police detectives for the Los Angeles Police Department. One of the co-writers of the script, Richard L. Breen had previously worked with Webb on the radio series Pat Novak for Hire, and would write at least three scripts for Dragnet, including the 1954 theatrical film and the 1966 TV-movie pilot for the revival series in which Morgan joined the cast as Detective Bill Gannon. Reception The film was not released in the USA until 1951 by which time it was retitled Appointment with Danger. It was released in the UK almost a year earlier. The movie was nominated for the Edgar for best mystery film of the year from the Mystery Writers of America, but lost to Five Fingers. =Critical response= Bosley Crowther, film critic for The New York Times, liked the film, especially the screenplay which Alan Ladd took full advantage of. He wrote, \\"[I]t's fairly obvious that it's all familiar stuff to our hero, for he evinces as much emotion over these muscular goings-on as a postal clerk counting air mail stamps. But he is fortunate in having a vehicle, which is basically a cops-and-robbers tale, tautly written by scenarists Richard Breen and Warren Duff, who also have injected humor in the modern idiom into their dialogue. And he is fortunate too in having the support of principals who handle these lines and roles as to the manner born. As a result, Appointment With Danger lives up to its title as Ladd, checking on the murder of another postal inspector in Gary, Ind., finds a visiting nun who saw the criminals.\\"Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, May 10, 1951. Last accessed: December 28, 2007. The staff at Variety magazine gave the film a positive review, writing, \\"Ladd is right at home as the tightlipped, tough inspector assigned to the case. There is a neat contrasting byplay in the nun character done by Phyllis Calvert as co-star, which adds an offbeat note to the meller plot.Variety. Film review, May 10, 1951.

Education Curtze participated in a Rotary Club student exchange to Scandinavia, which led to his appointment to the United States Naval Academy. Curtze was a star gymnast while attending the Naval Academy, winning second place in 1931 in the Eastern Intercollegiate Gymnastics League and leading the midshipmen to the league's championship in 1933. When he qualified for the US gymnastics team attending the 1936 Summer Olympics, his position with the US Navy caused the State Department to prohibit his travel to Berlin, Germany during Adolf Hitler's rule. Curtze graduated from the Naval Academy in 1933. He received his Master's degree in Naval Construction from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Career Curtze was serving as a fleet safety officer aboard the cruiser USS St. Louis at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. He helped guide the ship safely out of harbor, making it one of the few major ships to escape the Japanese bombings. He served with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as the engineering member of the first US team in London. He also served as commander of the San Francisco Naval Shipyard. Curtze and his commanding officer, Rear Admiral William A. Brockett, Chief of the Bureau of Ships, resigned their posts in 1965 to protest Secretary of Defense Robert S.

The bridges are similar in design to the pre-Hurricane Katrina I-10 Twin Span Bridge near New Orleans, Louisiana. Each of the two bridges is two lanes wide, for a total of four lanes, and long. The parkway was completed in 1978 and crosses the northern portion of Mobile Bay, running roughly parallel to the nearby Battleship Parkway, with which it has an interchange. It was named for the jubilee phenomena that occurs intermittently in Mobile Bay, but is commonly referred to locally and in the media as the \\"Bayway\\". Expansion View from underneath the bridges. Since 2001, the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) has planned to expand the parkway to a total of eight lanes in addition to a connecting cable-stayed bridge with a main span long and high that would bypass the George Wallace Tunnel. This is intended to eliminate the current traffic bottleneck on I-10 at the tunnel, but is very controversial locally due to the proposed bridge's potential visual and economic impact on the city. The arguments against the bridge have focused on the bridge's height of roughly , taller than any other structure in the city except for the RSA Battle House Tower, as potentially overshadowing the city. The potential economic impact is that, with less than of clearance under the bridge, it would hamper large ships and projects from the Port of Mobile and prevent large cruise ships from accessing the Alabama Cruise Terminal. Incidents One of the largest multi-vehicle collisions in U.S. history took place on the Parkway on the morning of March 20, 1995. Caused by fog on Mobile Bay, the accident involved around 200 vehicles, killed one person, and injured more than 90 others. During the ice storm of January 28‚Äì30, 2014, the Bayway was closed several times for hours, diverting traffic onto the Causeway, while ALDOT crews used grading equipment to remove ice from the roadway. Asked why the Bayway wasn't sanded or salted, ALDOT officials said that they did not have the spreader equipment since ice storms occur in the area only about once every 20 years.

It is broadcast four times on weekdays and twice on weekends. In January 2015 the new director is Juan Roberto Vargas and the second director is Alberto Medina Lopez. Before becoming a network, Caracol Televisi√≥n produced the morning newscast 7:30 Caracol in the mid-1990s. Several well-known Colombian journalists, such as Claudia Palacios, √ârika Fontalvo, and Mar√≠a Cristina Uribe were also news presenters of Caracol Noticias. Yamid Amat was its director until March 2002. The newsroom and studio was built in nine months before Caracol Noticias' first airing, on 10 July 1998. Canadian company Imageneering acted as a consultant. All Noticias Caracol newscasts are also aired live on Caracol TV Internacional. Sections Noticias Caracol newscasts are divided in sections, grouped in three blocks: \\"serious\\" news (regional, national, world news, weather, health), sports, and entertainment. For the world news, Noticias Caracol has signed some agreements with services such as APTN, Reuters, Telemundo, and CNN en Espa√±ol.

The refuge is situated west of the cities of Broomfield and Westminster and situated north of the city of Arvada.  Vision  Rocky Flats National Wildlife is an expanse of grasslands, shrublands and wetlands, including rare xeric tallgrass prairie, where natural processes support a broad range of native wildlife. Working with others, the refuge conserves the unique biotic communities and sustains wildlife populations at the interface of mountains and prairies on Colorado's Front Range. Fauna and flora This refuge is home to various animals, including a herd of 150 elk, occasional black bear, mountain lions, and moose; as well as badgers, bats, coyote, two species of owl, mule deer, northern flicker, white pelican, black-tailed prairie dog, and porcupine. The site also contains an estimated 630 plant species.  History  Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge covers over 5,000 acres, including these open plains. The Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge is one of over 560 refuges in the National Wildlife Refuge System ‚Äì a network of lands set aside and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service specifically for wildlife. The Refuge is located along the Front Range of Colorado at the intersection of Jefferson, Boulder, and Broomfield counties. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages the Refuge. Native Americans occupied the land intermittently prior to the 1800s and limited artifacts have been located from this era. Starting in 1868, the Scott family established a homestead here and the land was used to raise cattle. Later, the Lindsay family raised cattle and built a house and barn in the 1940s. In 1951, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission acquired 2,519 acres, which included the Lindsay property, for the Rocky Flats Plant to produce nuclear and nonnuclear weapons including plutonium fission primaries for nuclear weapons. An additional 4,027 acres were acquired in 1974 for plant expansion. This 6,500-acre Rocky Flats Site was one of 13 nuclear weapons production facilities in the United States during the Cold War and was managed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The plant operated from 1952 to 1994 with manufacturing activities taking place in the center portion of the site with a large buffer zone around the area. Nuclear production work stopped briefly to address environmental and safety concerns, and was resumed in 1990. In 1992, the Rocky Flats mission was terminated when President George H. W. Bush canceled the W-88 Trident Warhead program. Nuclear and nonnuclear production stopped in 1993, and in 1994 the last shipment of defense-related materials was sent off-site. The plant was subject to a $7 billion Superfund investigation and environmental cleanup effort. The site was added to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs (EPA) National Priorities List (Superfund List) in 1989. It was renamed the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site as of 1994. Through the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act of 2001, the site was established as a national wildlife refuge while cleanup of the site was underway. With oversight from the EPA and Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment (CDPHE), the DOE completed the $7 billion cleanup in 2005. The DOE still maintains 1,300 acres as part of their legacy management for long-term care and maintenance, and to ensure the cleanup is functioning as designed. These lands are not part of the Refuge. The Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge consists of lands that were the former Rocky Flats Plant security buffer zone. The Superfund investigation and cleanup effort found that Refuge lands (then-called the Peripheral Operable Unit) would be suitable for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure - that is, any use. Under the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act of 2001 (), most of the Rocky Flats site became a refuge, provided that certification from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is obtained and which asserts that the cleanup and closure have been completed. The refuge does not include the 600 acres that contain the former weapons site and monitoring areas. These remain under the jurisdiction of the DOE and will not be opened to the public. While some greet the new park with enthusiasm, others question assessments of its safety. Federal lawsuits have been filed against the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and others in an attempt to block opening of the park. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service opened the refuge‚Äôs trails on September 15, 2018.  Purpose  * Restoring and preserving native ecosystems. * Providing habitat for, and population management of native plants and migratory and resident wildlife. * Conserving threatened and endangered species. * Providing opportunities for compatible scientific research  Goals  * Wildlife and habitat management: Provide a riparian community representative of historic flora and fauna in a high valley of the southern Rocky Mountains to provide habitat for migratory birds, mammals, and river-dependent species * Public use, education and interpretation: Provide visitors and students high quality recreational, educational, and interpretive opportunities and foster an understanding and appreciation of the Refuge's xeric tallgrass prairie, upland shrub and wetland habitats; native wildlife; and the history of the site. * Safety: Conduct operations and manage public access in accordance with the final Rocky Flats' cleanup decision documents to ensure the safety of the Refuge visitors, staff and neighbors. * Effective and open communication: Conduct communication outreach efforts to raise public awareness about the Refuge programs. * Working with others: Foster beneficial partnerships with individuals, government agencies, and NGOs to promote resource conservation. * Refuge operations: Based on available funds, provide facilities and staff to fulfill the Refuge vision and purpose  Status  The Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP) emphasizes wildlife and habitat conservation, and a moderate level of wildlife-dependent public use. On April 17, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals terminated objections against a 2011 land exchange affecting the refuge. This exchange added over 600 acres of land to refuge and acquired over 1,200 acres of subsurface mineral rights beneath the refuge in exchange for a 300-foot transportation corridor along the refuge's eastern boundary. In September 2015, the wildlife refuge opened for two guided hikes. It officially opened to the public Sep. 15, 2018.  Controversy  During a $7 billion Superfund cleanup, millions of environmental data points (soil, air, surface water, ground water, sediment) were collected from thousands of sampling locations. The results of this environmental investigation are presented in a CERCLA report.RI/FS Report, https://www.lm.doe.gov/Rocky_Flats/Regulations.aspx Because the environmental investigation found levels of contamination in the Peripheral Operable Unit (now Refuge lands) were below levels of regulatory concern, the Refuge did not require remedial action. In May 2007, the POU was deleted from the Superfund National Priorities List. The lands comprising the POU were transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for establishment as the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge, pursuant to an Act of Congress. Despite the investigation and cleanup efforts, some question the adequacy of cleanup efforts and agency studies. In 2017, local activists sued the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. On September 29, 2017, the U.S. District Court dismissed this lawsuit. The Court explained the activist groups \\"merely rehashed old arguments,\\" and did not provide new evidence or legal authority as support for the lawsuit.See Order Denying Plaintiffs' Motions for Reconsideration and Leave to Amend And Granting Defendants Motion to Dismiss, Rocky Mtn. Peace and Justice Ctr. v U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (D. Colo. 2017). The Court awarded costs to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In 2018, several Colorado school districts voted to ban students from attending school-sanctioned trips to the former Rocky Flats plant, citing concerns about the area‚Äôs previous designation as a Superfund site. In mid-November, after the elections, Democratic majority leaders of both the State House and Senate (both representing nearby Boulder) joined the renewed call to close the refuge to the public.

Because of its popularity, it was rerun on February 9, 1955. It was written by Rod Serling and directed by Fielder Cook. Everett Sloane, Richard Kiley, and Ed Begley starred. Summary An intense big-business drama about up-and-coming vice- president Fred Staples (played by Richard Kiley). Ruthless corporate boss Walter Ramsie (played by Everett Sloane) attempts to edge out aging employee Andy Sloane (played by Ed Begley) to make room for newcomer Staples. Ramsie uses every opportunity to humiliate the fragile Sloane, while Staples sees Sloane as a professional who makes valuable contributions to the firm.IMDb Cast The cast consisted of the following: * Everett Sloane as Mr. Ramsie * Richard Kiley as Fred Staples * Ed Begley as Andy Sloane * June Dayton as Fran Staples * Joanna Roos as Miss Lanier * Elizabeth Montgomery as Ann Evans * Elizabeth Wilson as Marge Fleming * Jack Arthur as Starter * Victoria Ward as Miss Stevens * Sybil Baker as Telephone Operator * Shirley Standlee as Miss Hill * Theodore Newton as Mr. Gordon * Jack Livesey as Mr. Jamieson * Ronnie Welsh as Paul Sloane * Tom Charles * Ron Harper * Victor Harrison * Helen Ludlom Reception Serling's celebrated script tore apart the dynamics of the business world and earned Serling his first of his six Emmys for dramatic writing. There was a rave review from Jack Gould of The New York Times who suggested it be repeated: > Nothing in months has excited the television industry as much as the Kraft > Television Theatre's production of Patterns, an original play by Rod > Serling. The enthusiasm is justified. In writing, acting and direction, > Patterns will stand as one of the high points in the TV medium's evolution. > Patterns is a play with one point of view toward the fiercely competitive > world of big business and is bound to be compared with the current motion > picture Executive Suite. By comparison, Executive Suite might be Babes in > Toyland without a score. For sheer power of narrative, forcefulness of > characterization and brilliant climax, Mr. Serling's work is a creative > triumph that can stand on its own. In one of those inspired moments that > make the theater the wonder that it is, Patterns was an evening that > belonged to the many, not only to Mr. Serling. The performances of Everett > Sloane, Ed Begley and Richard Kiley were truly superb. The production and > direction of Fielder Cook constituted a fluid use of video's artistic tools > that underscore how little the TV artistic horizons really have been > explored. Patterns was seen from 9 to 10pm Wednesday over the National > Broadcasting Company's network; a repeat performance at an early date should > be mandatory. Gould, Jack. \\"Patterns is Hailed as a Notable Triumph,\\" The > New York Times, January 17, 1955. Gould's request for a repeat was an unusual suggestion, since in that pre- videotape era, live shows were not repeated. Surprisingly, NBC took Gould's suggestion seriously and made plans for another production. Second live performance thumb When Patterns returned on February 9, 1955, it was once again performed live, an unprecedented event. This was the first time a television drama was repeated due to popularity. The second performance, directly sustained by Kraft Foods' advertising agency, J. Walter Thompson, was captured on kinescope and is available for viewing at The Paley Center for Media in New York City and Los Angeles. On March 27, 1956, a feature-length film version of Patterns was released. The film featured an expanded script by Serling. Van Heflin replaced Kiley in the role of Fred Staples. In the April 27, 2008, edition of TV Week, the television critic Tom Shales compared the movie unfavorably to the live TV production: > Some people thought live TV was the beginning of a truly new storytelling > medium‚Äîone uniquely suited to intimate, unadorned, psychological dramas‚Äîbut > it turned out to be a beginning with a tiny middle and a rushed end... > Patterns was so well-received that Kraft mounted a live repeat of the show a > month later, and the intimate TV show was turned into a less intimate (and > somehow less satisfying) movie in 1956. Except for the use of terms like > ‚Äúmimeographed‚Äù and ‚Äúteletype,‚Äù little about the drama seems dated, unless > one is of the opinion that corporate politics and boardroom bloodletting no > longer exist... With minimally judicious scene-setting (shots of clocks, a > building directory, a switchboard) and a rapid introduction of characters, > Serling pulls a viewer almost immediately into his story, a tale of > corporate morality‚Äîor the lack of it‚Äîand such everyday battles as the ones > waged between conscience and ambition.

At this congress, summoned by the Habsburg Emperor Leopold I, permission was for the first time granted for followers of the Augsburg and Calvinist confessions to erect and maintain churches within the Emperor's dominions within the Kingdom of Hungary. As this permission was contained in Articles (i.e. clauses) 25 and 26 of the Congress's deliberations, the term 'articular' was applied to them. Background The Sopron Congress was called against a background of social unrest, including civil revolt, religious friction and continuing threat of invasion from Turkey. The Emperor therefore determined that it was necessary to make concessions to his Protestant population to secure its loyalty. However, severe restrictions were placed on the Protestant congregations. No more than two churches could be built in each administrative region (county)‚Äî in areas of strategic importance, the limit was one church ‚Äî and buildings had to be outside city walls. Further regulations determined siting, and building procedures. As a consequence, the articular churches were all built of wood, mostly in the period 1681-1730. There were originally 38 such churches, nearly all located in the region of today's Slovakia. Many of the churches displayed extraordinary ingenuity in their construction. They were typically decorated within by painting, often of a trompe l'oeil nature giving the impression of marble columns or drapery. The articular churches today Five articular churches survive today in Slovakia. Perhaps the most well-known is the church in Ke≈æmarok, built between 1718 and 1730 under the direction of Juraj M√ºttermann, replacing an earlier structure of 1687. Others are at Le≈°tiny (1689, restored 1860s), Hronsek (1725-6, a wood-framed structure now without internal wall-paintings), Istebn√© (built between 1686 and 1731) and Sv√§t√Ω Kr√≠≈æ (about 1693). The latter church was originally located at the village of Paludza, which was submerged in the Liptovsk√° Mara reservoir in the late 1970s. Between 1974 and 1977 the church was carefully dismantled and restored before being rebuilt in Sv√§t√Ω Kr√≠≈æ, where it was reconsecrated in 1982. The churches in Ke≈æmarok, Le≈°tiny and Hronsek are now part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site called Wooden churches of the Slovak Carpathians, declared in 2008. The articular church at Spi≈°sk√° Nov√° Ves was dismantled in 1924, but some of its decorations, including a 17th-century retable depicting the mines and miners who brought the Spi≈° region much of its wealth, are preserved in the museum at Spi≈°sk√° Sobota.

It was a popular form of protest during the Indian independence movement and part of Mahatma Gandhi's satyagraha form of civil disobedience and protest. In India, there are designated places for conducting Dharna, and a permission is required for it. Often, those practicing dharna break the permission leading to clashes with law enforcement. Dharna generally refers to fixing one's mind on an object. It refers to whole-heartedly pledging toward an outcome or to inculcating a directed attitude. Dharna is consciously and diligently holding a point of view with the intent of achieving a goal. The word originates from the Sanskrit word dharnam. In Pakistan, the term was first used in 1958 by Abdul Qayyum Khan against the Prime Minister Feroze Khan's administration to remove his President Iskander Mirza but its effective usage was made by Naeem Siddiqui proposed to use dharna politics for obtaining objectives and latter on Qazi Hussain Ahmed and Jammat e Islami organised dharna in Pakistan in 1993, Fazl Ur Rehman, Nawaz Sharif, Maryam Safdar awan and other political and religious leaders are now attempting to use this strategy for their purposes.

The report was funded and published by the Carnegie Corporation. Background Before the study, white poverty had long been the subject of debate in South Africa, and poor whites the subject of church, scholarly and state attention. White poverty became a social problem in the early 1900s, when many whites were dispossessed of land as a result of the Anglo Boer War, especially in the Cape and Transvaal. It was not uncommon to find whites who were driven into wage labour managing a lifestyle similar to that of Bantu wage labourers. As white proletarianisation proceeded and racial integration began to emerge as an urban phenomenon, white poverty attracted attention and concern. In the 1870s, for example, a colonial visitor to Grahamstown wrote that ‚Äòmiscellaneous herds of whites and blacks lived together in the most promiscuous manner imaginable.‚Äô According to one memorandum sent to Frederick Keppel, then president of Carnegie, there was \\"little doubt that if the Bantu were given full economic opportunity, the more competent among them would soon outstrip the less competent whites\\". Keppel's support for the project of creating the report was motivated by his concern with the maintenance of existing racial boundaries. The preoccupation of the Carnegie Corporation with the so-called poor white problem in South Africa was at least in part the outcome of similar misgivings about the state of poor whites in the American South. The report The commission report encompassed five volumes that dealt, in turn, with the economic, psychological, educational, health, and sociological facets of the \\"poor white\\" phenomenon. At the turn of the century white Americans and whites elsewhere in the world felt uneasy because poverty and economic depression seemed to strike people regardless of race. White poverty contradicted notions of racial superiority and hence it became the focus of \\"scientific\\" study. The report recommended that \\"employment sanctuaries\\" be established for poor white workers and that poor white workers should replace \\"native\\" black workers in most skilled aspects of the economy. The authors of the report suggested that unless something was done to help poor whites racial deterioration and miscegenation would be the outcome. Although the ground work for Apartheid began earlier, the report provided support for the idea that the maintenance of white superiority would require support from social institutions. This was the justification for the segregation, and discrimination of the following decades. The report expressed fear about the loss of white racial pride, and in particular pointed to the danger that the poor white would not be able to resist the process of \\"Bantu-isation.\\" In seeking to prevent a class-based movement that would unite the poor across racial lines the report sought to heighten race as opposed to class differences as the significant social category. Impact The findings of the report helped bolster support for segregation and strict limits and laws for black South Africans. The hope was that the program of segregation would help poor whites, by giving them institutional assistance, and thus prevent race-mixing and maintain racial purity and economic power. Because of the \\"poor white problem\\" institutional racism in South Africa would differ from institutional racism in other parts of the world where scientific racism, which supposed intrinsic racial differences, played a more prominent role (many white Afrikaners have multi- racial ancestors). Although scientific racism played a role in justifying and supporting institutional racism in South Africa, it was not as important in South Africa as it has been in Europe and the United States. This was due, in part to the \\"poor white problem\\", described by the report. The report raised serious questions for supremacists about white racial superiority. Since poor whites were found to be in the same situation as Bantu in the African environment, the idea that intrinsic white superiority could overcome any environment did not seem to hold. As such, \\"scientific\\" justifications for racism were not as widely used in South Africa as they were in other parts of the world.

In 2006 her novel, Time in a Garden, appeared on best-seller fiction lists all over northern Michigan. She has written five novels (For Things Left Undone, 2001; Time in a Garden, 2006; Vox Humana: The Human Voice, 2007; In Transit, 2008; and Community of Scholars, 2009) and numerous non-fiction books, articles and texts. Life and influences =Childhood= Agria grew up in Appleton, Wisconsin where her mother worked as executive secretary to the president of a large fraternal life insurance company. Her father was a mechanical engineer with an international paper company. Family life instilled in her a deep love of writing and travel. As a sixth grader she wrote the winning script about Stephen Foster for a school drama contest. In high school and early college, she worked as a journalist summers for The Post-Crescent in Appleton, the paper that gave Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning novelist Edna Ferber her start‚Äîa writer whose style Agria always admired. =Education= She earned her BA in English (1964) and an MA in German literature and linguistics from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison (1965). She spent 1962-1963 studying theater arts at the University of Bonn, Germany thanks to a Marshall Plan scholarship. Her undergrad thesis on the songs in Bertolt Brecht's Three Penny Opera and John Gay's Beggar's Opera was a winner of the UWM undergrad essay competition. =Early career= After a job in Public Relations and as freelance editor at UW Press-Madison, Agria became director of a Work-Education Council in Alma, Michigan designated by the US Department of Labor as a model for innovative community development programs. The experience resulted in consultancies and freelance writing assignments in the career field and on rural issues. Periodic moves throughout her marriage to now retired University President Dr. John Agria opened many diverse job and life changes all of which she uses in her writing. She wrote grants for a Long Island, NY, music school, worked as chaplain for United Campus Ministries in NY, and directed a community development think-tank at Thiel College in PA. As researcher for the Center for Theology and Land in Dubuque, Iowa, she traveled extensively, studied and wrote about rural life. =Recent years= Community building remains an important undercurrent in her novels, the power of relationships to promote growth and change. A church organist since her early teens, after \\"retiring\\" to Long Island, NY, Agria served as organist/music director of several churches ‚Äî a background she put to good use in her novel, Vox Humana: The Human Voice. One of her many accomplishments as a church music director was producing and directing a fully staged medieval mystery play, Nativity, from her script compiled from several early manuscripts. She also learned to weave for Vox Humana, seeing strong ties between music and that ancient art form. A love of community gardening in the northern Michigan summer Chautauqua community of Bay View inspired her summer 2006 best-selling novel, Time in a Garden ‚Äî a love song to the aging process, spirituality and gardening. In Transit, about lives and families in transition, was researched on travels with her husband in their motor home, including a 2007 coast-to-coast book tour. As mother of four daughters and a growing brood of grandchildren, the healing power of love, family and community runs through her work.

Background  In 1249, Saint Louis IX of France went away on crusade, leaving his mother, Blanche of Castile, as regent during his absence. Louis was defeated and captured in Egypt. When news of this reached France the next year, both nobles and peasants were deeply distressed; the king was well-loved and it was inconceivable to them that such a pious man could be defeated by heathens. Louis sent his brothers to France to get relief, where despite the efforts of Blanche of Castile, it was seen that neither the nobility nor the clergy were helping the king.  Formation  One of the outpourings of support took the form of a peasant movement in northern France, led by a man known as \\"the Master of Hungary\\" (). He was apparently a very old Hungarian monk living in France, called Jacob. The Master claimed to have been visited by the Virgin Mary, who instructed him to lead the shepherds (, hence the common name Crusade of the ) of France to the Holy Land to rescue Louis. His followers, said to number 60,000, were mostly young peasants, men, women, and children, from Brabant, Hainaut, Flanders, and Picardy. They followed him to Paris in May, where the Master met with Blanche of Castile. Chronicler Matthew Paris thought he was an impostor, and that he was actually one of the leaders of the Children's Crusade from earlier in the century.Matthew Paris, Chronica Majora Their movement in the city was restricted; they were not allowed to cross to the Left Bank, where the University of Paris was located, as Blanche perhaps feared another disturbance on the scale of the University of Paris strike of 1229.  Dispersal  The crowd of shepherds split up after leaving the city. Some of them went to Rouen, where they expelled the archbishop and threw some priests into the Seine river. In Tours they attacked monasteries. The others under the Master arrived in Orl√©ans on June 11. Here they were denounced by the bishop, whom they also attacked, along with other clerics, including Franciscans and Dominicans. They fought with the university students in the city as well, as Blanche might have feared would happen in Paris. Moving on to Amiens and then Bourges, they also began to attack Jews. Blanche responded by ordering the crowds to be rounded up and excommunicated. This was done rather easily as they were simply wandering, directionless, around northern France, but the group led by the Master resisted outside Bourges, and the Master himself was killed in the ensuing skirmish. The crusade seems to have been more of a revolt against the French church and nobility, who were thought to have abandoned Louis; the shepherds, of course, had no idea what happened to Louis, or the logistics involved in undertaking a crusade to rescue him. After being dispersed, some of the participants traveled to Aquitaine and England, where they were forbidden to preach. Others took a true crusade vow and may have actually gone on crusade.

Apart from pricing markets, they also engage in any activity regarding the trading aspects of gambling, such as monitoring customer accounts and the profitability of their operations. The odds are derived from a variety of factors through analysis of information. Certain markets are highly statistical, whereas other markets require more intuition and insight. An odds compiler may be required to monitor the financial position the bookmaker is in and adjust their position (and odds) accordingly. They may also be consulted as to whether to accept a bet or not, usually in the case where a very large bet is being placed, so as to not incur dangerously-high liabilities. Odds are usually not set completely independent from other bookmakers but are influenced by what others are quoting. This is particularly important when the overround is below 100% and hence arbitrage betting, where betters can make a profit regardless of the outcome, is possible (see mathematics of bookmaking). In this case, the bookmaker with the most aberrant odds would usually alter their odds closer to other bookmakers' prices. The odds are influenced by betting volume so that a selection receiving a high volume of liquidity may have the odds for it cut.

Measuring , it is the largest island of an archipelago of three closely spaced islands jutting out south from the mainland at Portovenere. The other islands, Tino, and the tiny Tinetto lie further south. In 1997, the archipelago, together with Portovenere and the Cinque Terre, was designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Description The marble caves The Palmaria island with a surface area of , is the largest of three islands in the Gulf of La Spezia and the Liguria region of the whole, the other two islands, Tino and Tinetto meet down a few hundred meters straight line to the south. The island has a triangular shape: the sides that face Portovenere and the Gulf of La Spezia are the most humanized and slope gently down to the level of the sea, covered by typical Mediterranean vegetation, the side that faces west, i.e. towards the open sea, is instead characterized by high cliffs overhanging the water, in which there are many caves. The sides humanized see the presence of some private homes, a restaurant (in Pozzale) and especially bathing establishments, both public and confidential employees of the Navy and Air Force. As for the western side, the most difficult to reach, are worthy of note the Blue Cave, visited by boat, and the Cave of Pigeons, which can be reached only by climbing down ropes. The latter in particular has been very important in the study of historical events in the Gulf, as have been found inside the fossilized bones of Pleistocene animals such as chamois and the snowy owl, but above all remains of human burials, testifying the presence of man at least five thousand years ago. On the island there are also many buildings of a military character and of great historical interest: the top, inaccessible as a former military area and is currently in a state of neglect, the Fort Count of Cavour (or Fort Palmaria), the battery now used as experimental environmental education center and Batteria Semaforo near the Scola Tip, the tower ironclad Umberto I and used in World War II to a military prison and renovated a few years ago and the remains of the battery Albini, scattered throughout the island, several bunkers from the Second World War and the remains of coastal artillery and antiaircraft mostly inaccessible since abandoned and submerged vegetation. Portoro marble Remarkable is the presence (in the south, called Pozzale) of an abandoned quarry, once used for the extraction of the precious black marble with streaks of gold called portoro. There are still remnants of cranes and hoists used for moving the blocks of marble and the walls of the houses of the miners.National Park Natural habitat =Flora= The flora of Palmaria is composed of about 500 species. The original vegetation, which must have consisted mainly of Mediterranean scrub and oak wood forest, was modified by anthropic causes such as fire, agriculture, introduction of alien plants and animals (plane trees, palms and rabbits). Today the pines (Pinus pinaster and Pinus halepensis) share space with typical Mediterranean species such as holly oak (Quercus ilex), downy oak (Quercus pubescens), mastic (Pistacia lentiscus), strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), rockrose (Cistus monspeliensis, Cistus salvifolius, Cistus incanus), Spanish broom (Spartium junceum), etc. Other important plant groups include spurge (Euphorbia dendroides) and nearest to the sea cliffs on those characterized by samphire (Crithmum maritimum). Among the new flora, Centaurea cineraria veneris, Iberis umbellata var. linifolia, exclusive in Palmaria, Centaurea aplolepa lunensis, endemic to eastern Liguria. Finally, also worth Brassica oleracea robertiana, Serapias neglecta and Cistus incanus, rare in Liguria, where it reaches its northern limit. =Fauna= Islands of Palmaria and Tino On the island, there exists a large quantity of reptilian species, such as the European leaf-toed gecko (Phyllodactylus europaeus), the smallest of the European geckos. While present on the neighboring islands of Tino and Tinetto, this species is rare in Liguria. Bird species found on the island include the kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), red partridge (Alectoris rufa), gulls (Larus argentatus, Larus michahellis), raven (Corvus corax), rock thrushes (Monticola solitarius), and cormorant (Phalacrocorax aristotelis). Several species of bats are found in caves on Palmaria: the trunnion (Plecotus auritus), greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), and lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros). Colonies of rabbits and goats on the island are remains of a recent past when the island was more inhabited by humans. The beetle Parmenas solieri is an endemic species linked to spurge patches found on the island. Climate and maritime links The climate is typically Mediterranean, temperate on both daily and seasonal timescales. In winter, there are very few episodes of extreme cold or frost, while in summer the heat is moderated by the effect of the sea breeze. The abundant rainfall follows the trends of the Riviera di Levante, especially heavy in autumn and spring. For the maritime links, is possible reach the island by private boat or, in the summer months, with ferries that connect to Portovenere, Lerici, and La Spezia.

He was accused of cowardice by the people of Buenos Aires after escaping the city during the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata in 1806. He was born in Seville, 27 November 1745.

He married again at seventy-five years of age with Do√±a Mar√≠a Teresa Mill√°n y Marlos, widow of a nephew of Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, the last Viceroy of the R√≠o de la Plata.  Posts held by Sobremonte  Rafael de Sobremonte held various posts in the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata: *Viceroyalty Secretary, as a Lieutenant Coronel, during the Viceroyalty of Juan Jos√© de V√©rtiz y Salcedo (1779‚Äì1783) *Governor of C√≥rdoba del Tucum√°n (1783‚Äì1797) *Sub-Inspector General of veteran troops and militias (1797‚Äì1804) *President of the Audiencia de R√≠o de la Plata (1804) *Viceroy, Gobernor and Captain General of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata (1804‚Äì1807)  Governor of C√≥rdoba  From 1784, and for almost fifteen years, he was Governor of C√≥rdoba, distinguishing himself as an excellent administrator. He cleaned and repaired the city streets, ordered the construction of the first water system, carrying running water to C√≥rdoba from the Primero River, and also the construction of defenses against river flooding. He opened a free public school, and ordered the constructions of rural schools. Created the Civil Law career at the University of San Carlos, improved the administration of the neighborhoods, started the first street lighting system and founded a women's hospital. Improved the justice system which was lacking in attentio due to the distance to Buenos Aires. During his administration he improved working conditions in the mines, and gave help to the mining industry in other provinces. He built small forts and towns to try to defend against Indian raids: R√≠o Cuarto, La Carlota, San Fernando, Santa Catalina, San Bernardo, San Rafael, Villa del Rosario, etc. In 1797 he was named inspector general of the army of the Viceroyalty. In that capacity he labored to improve it to be able to resist an invasion from Brazil or England, specifically fortifying Montevideo and Colonia del Sacramento.  Viceroyalty and the war with Britain  In April 1804, at the death of Viceroy Joaqu√≠n del Pino, he was named as his replacement as Viceroy of the R√≠o de la Plata. At that time, Great Britain and Spain were at war, creating the risk of an attack on Buenos Aires. He requested help from the Spanish Courts, but the Prime Minister Manuel Godoy answered that he should defend as best as he could, with no help forthcoming. Believing there was a high probability of a British attack in Montevideo, he fortified that city and sent his best troops. It was the logical decision due to geography, and it would have been very difficult to dislodge them, had they captured that fortified port city. The military of the viceroyalty had suffered many casualties lately, particularly during the native uprisings of Tupac Amaru. All the help he obtained were a few cannons and the suggestion to arm the people for the defense. The Viceroy understood that arming the creole civilian population, many of them influenced by revolutionary ideas, fomented by the American and French revolutions, was a dangerous strategy for the interests of the Crown. History would prove him right as only six years later the Argentine movement for independence was started. He had few officers, mostly inexperienced and inefficient, and his navy was very weak. His army only had 2,500 men, most of them recruits, with little or no experience with arms. As part of his defensive measures, he named the French Santiago de Liniers commander of the port of Ensenada de Barrag√°n, about south of Buenos Aires, with orders to protect the coast. Liniers sent him several warnings that the British had been seen exploring the coast of the River Plate.  First British Invasion  On 24 June 1806, while attending a theater play with his family, the viceroy received news that British ships have been sighted along the coast. A report from Liniers indicated it consisted of despicable corsairs, without the bravery and the will to attack. Sobremonte left the play early going to Buenos Aires Fort, where he wrote an order to organize the defense. The next morning, the enemy's ships were sighted again on the Buenos Aires coast and cannon was shot from the fort with no effect. He was not sure if it would be an attack, he sent brigadier Arce to repel any possible landing around the coastal city of Quilmes. Arce, commanding about 500 troops, let them land without attacking, sure they could not cross the marshes that separated the beaches from the mainland. The invaders did cross and Arce's troops retreated, allowing the British to march towards the city on June 26. About 1,500 troops, commanded by William Carr Beresford landed from the ships commanded by Home Riggs Popham, the invasion plan's author. Sobremonte gave a speech, directing able men to join the militias. Organization was lacking and not everybody was supplied with arms. Many muskets were supplied without proper shot or flints; swords and sabres were not well maintained. His own officers accused him of the chaos and confusion, but did little to remedy the situation. The Viceroy attempted to form a defense by the Riachuelo, the city's southern border, ordering the burning of the G√°lvez bridge (located on the site of today's Pueyrred√≥n Bridge). He moved his troops to the west, believing the British would cross upriver, where he could attack them. The British captured the river-crossing boats, crossing to the north side. The defense failed there on their first attempt, and the viceroy gave incoherent orders which added to the chaos and confusion.  Run away  Sobremonte left the city and decided to move to C√≥rdoba, some away. Since the time of V√©rtiz there was a regulation that stated that if Buenos Aires was attacked by a foreign invader and the capital could not be held, there must be a move to the interior of the country and organize the defense in C√≥rdoba, in order to defend the rest of the Viceroyalty, and have a fighting chance to reconquer the capital with some chances of success. Above all, neither the viceroy, nor his family should fall to the invaders, in order to avoid being forced to sign a capitulation. Sobremonte, accused of cowardice by many at the time, followed the directive by moving to C√≥rdoba. Buenos Aires did not represent a significant portion of the economy of the viceroyalty at the time, and Sobremonte decided to consolidate his military position in C√≥rdoba, reorganizing his forces, and trying to effect a reconquer of the capital over a military solid foundation, before reinforcements could be sent from Britain.A. J. P√©rez Amuchastegui, en ‚ÄúMas all√° de la cr√≥nica‚Äù, ed Codex, 1968, p√°g VII He also understood that arming the populace for a defense implied giving effective power to the Creoles.Carlos Roberts(2000). Las invasiones inglesas del R√≠o de la Plata (1806‚Äì1807) y la influencia inglesa en la independencia y organizaci√≥n de las provincias del R√≠o de la Plata WIth about 2,000 men, and carrying the royal treasure, the viceroy left for Luj√°n. He left the treasure there, which he could not carry due to the bad state of the roads in winter, then continued in the road to C√≥rdoba. The local Buenos Aires militias abandoned him, for the most part because they did not want to leave their homes and families. Once the city of Buenos Aires was captured by the British, the local merchants offered him the public coffers in exchange for the boats, ships he had captured, and the private moneys Sobremonte had taken.Carlos Roberts p.153 They wrote the viceroy, asking him for the handing of the treasure he had taken, and guided the British to the cabildo at Luj√°n. The invaders captured the treasure, sending it to London, where it was paraded in triumph on its way to the bank vaults (not knowing that a month earlier, the porte√±os had reconquered the city).  Reconquest and ouster  On 14 July, Sobremonte declared C√≥rdoba temporary capital of the viceroyalty. He urged people to disobey any order coming from Buenos Aires during the occupation. He gathered the available troops and a few weeks later he marched with 3,000 troops back to Buenos Aires. In the meantime, Liniers had brought the troops sent to Montevideo the previous year by the viceroy, joining them to the Buenos Aires volunteers being trained by Juan Mart√≠n de Pueyrred√≥n and Mart√≠n de √Ålzaga. This army started retaking the city without waiting for the viceroy, accomplishing the task by 12 August. Immediately after the reconquest, √Ålzaga called for an open cabildo of the people of Buenos Aires to refuse the viceroy command of the city. Liniers was named army commander, and civilian authority was given to the Audiencia Real. The measures were revolutionary, as it deposed the King's representative. Sobremonte went to Montevideo with the remainder of his troops before it was invaded as the British fleet had never left the River Plate. Montevideo's citizens, influenced by Buenos Aires's feelings, refused to fight the invaders under Sobremonte. He left the city in order to fight the British at their landing place, but his troops deserted. When Montevideo fell to the British, the open cabildo in Buenos Aires deposed him as viceroy, replacing him with Liniers. The citizen army fought this second invasion under Liniers and √Ålzaga, forcing the British surrender.  References   Bibliography  * Scenna, Miguel √Ångel, Las brevas maduras.

Initially aiming to help the Reconquista of Iberia, it failed to gain support from the church or nobility and instead murdered hundreds of Jews in France and Aragon. Causes The causes are complex; however, at that time a wake of famines had set in related to climatic changes (the \\"little ice age\\") and the economic situation for the rural poor had deteriorated. Furthermore, there were prophecies and talks about a new crusade. Also, indebtedness to Jewish moneylenders had been apparently eliminated with their eviction by King Philip the Fair in 1306; however, his son Louis X brought them back and became a partner in the recovery of their debts.Barbara Tuchman. A Distant Mirror. Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1978, p41f Beginnings The crusade started in May 1320 in Normandy, when a teenage shepherd claimed to have been visited by the Holy Spirit, which instructed him to fight the Moors in Iberia. Similar to the 1251 crusade, this movement included mostly young men, women, and children. They marched to Paris to ask Philip V to lead them, but he refused to meet with them at all. While in Paris they liberated prisoners in the Grand Ch√¢telet. Progress Instead they marched south to Aquitaine, attacking castles, royal officials, priests, and lepers along the way. Their usual targets, however, were Jews, whom they attacked at Saintes, Verdun-sur- Garonne, Cahors, Albi, and Toulouse, which they reached on June 12. Pope John XXII, in Avignon, gave orders to stop them. When they eventually crossed into Spain, their attacks on the Jews were well-known, and James II of Aragon vowed to protect his citizens. At first they were prohibited from entering the kingdom at all, but when they did enter in July, James warned all his nobles to make sure the Jews were kept safe. As expected the shepherds did attack some Jews, especially at the fortress of Montclus, where over 300 Jews were killed. James's son Alfonso was sent out to bring them under control. Those responsible for the massacre at Montclus were arrested and executed. There were no further incidents and the crusade dispersed. Aftermath This \\"crusade\\" is seen as a revolt against the French monarchy, somewhat like the first Shepherds' Crusade. Jews were seen as a symbol of royal power, as they more than any other population relied on the personal protection of the king both in France and in Aragon, and were often a symbol of the royal economy as well, hated by poor and heavily taxed peasants. Only a few years previously, the Jews had been allowed to return to France, after being expelled in 1306. Any debts owed to the Jews were collected by the monarchy after their expulsion, which probably also contributed to the peasant connection of the Jews with the king. In 1321, King Philip fined those communities in which Jews had been killed. This led to a second revolt, this time among the urban population, although later chroniclers invented the idea of a \\"cowherds' crusade\\", a second wave of the Shepherds' Crusade. Although this never occurred, there were, however, more attacks on Jews as a result of the fines.

Pellegrinetti served as a military chaplain during World War I, from 1917 to 1918, after which he was named secretary of the nunciature to Poland. From 1919 to 1922, he was auditor of the same nunciature. He was raised to the rank of a Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on 29 July 1919, and a Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on 22 February 1922. On 24 May 1922, Pellegrinetti was appointed Titular Archbishop of Adana by Pope Pius XI, and Nuncio to Yugoslavia a week later, on 29 May. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 18 June from Cardinal Pietro Gasparri, with Archbishops Giovanni Maria Zonghi and Giovanni Volpi serving as co-consecrators, at the church of Santa Maria in Campitelli. Pellegrinetti served as the papal legate to the National Eucharistic Congress in Zagreb on 30 July 1930. He also negotiated a concordat between Yugoslavia and the Vatican that the Yugoslav parliament did not ratify following riots that protested its indulgent stance towards Catholicism. Pope Pius made him Cardinal Priest of San Lorenzo in Panisperna in the consistory of 16 December 1937. Pellegrinetti was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1939 papal conclave, which selected Pope Pius XII. He died in Rome at age 67. He is buried in the collegiate church of his native Camaiore.

McDonald's traces its origins to a 1940 restaurant in San Bernardino, California. After expanding within the United States, McDonald's became an international corporation in 1967, when it opened a location in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada. By the end of the 1970s, McDonald's restaurants existed in five of the Earth's seven continents; an African location came in 1992 in Casablanca, Morocco. In order to cater to local tastes and culinary traditions, and often in respect of particular laws or religious beliefs, McDonald's offers regionalized versions of its menu among and within different countries. As a result, products found in one country or region may not be found in McDonald's restaurants in other countries.

These restaurants also offer a Chicken Big Mac and Fish Mac, variations on the standard Big Mac which substitute breaded chicken or fish, respectively, for the usual beef patties.

Quebec also saw the release of the limited-time 1967 Burger, commemorating Canada's first McDonald's franchise. Deli Choices were introduced throughout Canada in 2006 but were later discontinued. Unique to Canadian McDonald's locations is the McMini, miniature sandwiches with grilled or crispy chicken; flavors include Pesto Chicken (later replaced by Zesty Mango) and Spicy Thai. As in the United States, the McRib periodically appears on the menu for limited runs.

Hawaii locations offer saimin on their regular menu, and include Spam, Portuguese sausage and rice as a breakfast option. Pineapple and taro pies, as regularly sold in some Asian countries, have been occasionally offered on the regular menu, along with haupia pies; pineapple is also sometimes available as a topping on burgers.

Except for saimin, Hawaiian and selected Asian specialty items can also be found in McDonald's in the US territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. During Easter time, Hawaii, Guam and the CNMI all feature the Double Filet-O- Fish meal due to having a heavy concentration of Catholics (mostly people who immigrated from the Philippines) in that region. Puerto Rico Unlike Mexico, several Puerto Rican McDonald's restaurants serve fish products, although fish is not listed on McDonald's Puerto Rico's official website. Puerto Rican restaurants also serve the McCriollo (with eggs and cheese) for breakfast. Criollo is a Puerto Rican bread, like a baguette, but bigger and softer.

McDonald's trialed a partial relaunch of the Georgie Pie brand in May 2013 with one pie flavor sold through eleven of its restaurants. In October 2013, the affiliate announced it would expand the sale of Georgie Pie to 107 of its 161 restaurants by the end of 2013.

First published in 1992 as The Creationists: The Evolution of Scientific Creationism, a revised and expanded edition was published under the current title in 2006. The book has been described as \\"probably the most definitive history of anti- evolutionism\\".Steve Paulson, \\"Seeing the light -- of science\\", Interview with Ronald Numbers, Salon.com, Jan. 2, 2007. It has received generally favorable reviews from both the academic and the religious community.See references in \\"notable reviews\\". Synopsis The expanded edition covers the history of creationism from the time of Charles Darwin to 2006. It first describes early opposition during Darwin's lifetime, then George Frederick Wright's conversion from Christian Darwinist to Fundamentalist opponent and how creationism influenced the Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist Controversy and the rise of prominent populist creationists such as William Jennings Bryan. It then narrates the careers of two early, self-taught, 'scientific' creationists; the old Earth creationist Harry Rimmer, and the young Earth flood geologist George McCready Price. It then chronicles the growth of creationist organisations in the mid 20th century, such as the Religion and Science Association, the Deluge Geology Society, the Evolution Protest Movement (in the United Kingdom), and the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA), the latter moving almost immediately in the direction of theistic evolution. The book then narrates the young Earth creationist backlash against the ASA's modernism, with Henry M. Morris and John C. Whitcomb, Jr.'s publication of The Genesis Flood (1961) and the forming of the Creation Research Society, which created the creation science movement. It continues with Morris' founding of the Institute for Creation Research and the Seventh-day Adventist Church's founding of the Geoscience Research Institute. The book then describes the influence of creationism in churches and in countries outside the United States, and the rise of the intelligent design movement, before concluding with a chapter on creationism's global impact. Creationists mentioned in the book include George Frederick Wright, Louis Agassiz, John William Dawson, George D. Armstrong, Reverend Herbert W. Morris, Charles Hodge, Robert Lewis Dabney, Dwight L. Moody, H. L. Hastings, Luther T. Townsend, Alexander Patterson, Robert Patterson, Eleazar Lord, David Lord, James Dwight Dana. Reception In the ecumenical journal First Things, historian of Christianity Mark A. Noll describes its 1992 edition as a \\"thorough, patient, even-handed, and exhaustively researched\\" chronicle of twentieth century creationism. Former Archbishop of York John Habgood described the expanded edition, in an article in The Times, as a \\"massively well-documented history\\" that \\"must surely be the definitive study of the rise and growth of a cluster of well-meaning, but irrational, theories over a period of some 160 years.\\"The creation of Creationism, John Habgood, The Times, July 23, 2008 Editions * 1992 - New York: Knopf (as The Creationists: The Evolution of Scientific Creationism) * 1993 - paperback edition, University of California Press * 2006 - expanded edition, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press (newly subtitled: The Creationists: From Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design), Notable reviews ; Original edition * Stephen R.

Plettenberg was presiding governor after Ryk Tulbagh's death. On 18 May 1774 he was permanently appointed as governor.  Early years  Plettenberg descended from an aristocratic family from Westphalia in the Holy Roman Empire, the House of Plettenberg. His parents were Henrik Casimir van Plettenberg, colonel in the orange garrison in Leeuwarden and Agatha Petronella van Ammena. After his studies of law at the Utrecht University he left the country in 1764 and became in the service of the Dutch East India Company for 2 years a member of the Council of Law in Batavia. In 1767 he married Cornelia Charlotte Feith, the widow of Louis Taillefer.  Cape Town  The Residency, erected by Plettenberg in Simon's Town At this time Cape Town was the property of a commercial company, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and not a colony of the Netherlands. At 28 years of age, in 1767, Plettenberg became \\"Independent-Fiscaal\\", the highest official of justice at Cape Town. After the death of Governor Ryk Tulbagh, Plettenberg took control of the administration; on 11 August 1771, he became governor. On 1 June 1773, Plettenberg presided over a platoon of 30 soldiers charged with the task of salvaging goods and money from the De Jonge Thomas wrecked in a storm in Table Bay. During the salvage operation, the father of one of the soldiers, Wolraad Woltemade heroically rescued men from the ship, unaided by the soldiers. The French-influenced Patriotic Movement (\\"Patriotte beweging\\") became a strong opposition to him. Petitions of colonists in 1779 and 1782 to the Lords Seventeen of the Dutch East India Company and to the \\"Staten-Generaal\\" of the Netherlands in 1784 show the problems between the governor and the colonists.http://databases.tanap.net/cgh/make_pdf.cfm?artikelid=24735http://databases.tanap.net/cgh/make_pdf.cfm?artikelid=24478 The free burghers wished for greater representation in the courts and policy councils, codification of laws and some economic benefits, such as free trade (which were hindered by the trading activities of Company officials and various restrictions on the farmers).  Later years  Huis Windesheim In 1781 Plettenberg defended himself in a record. In 1785 he requested for discharge and was dismissed \\"with all honors\\". He resigned on 14 February 1785 and went back to the Netherlands, where he died on 18 August 1793, at his Huis Windesheim, near Zwolle. His successor as Governor of Cape Town was Lieutenant Colonel Cornelis Jacob van de Graaff.  Exploration  Old Timber Store Plettenberg had great interest in the discovery of unknown regions and supported the exploration of southern Africa. In his time were the voyages of August Frederik Beutler, Carl Joseph Kindermann, Carl Peter Thunberg, Anders Sparrman, Francis Masson, William Patterson, Jan Splinter Stavornius or Stavorinus, Robert Jacob Gordon and Fran√ßois Le Vaillant (Levaillant). He made several tours to determine the borders of the Cape-Colony and visited 47 outposts. Among others he erected a column for the Dutch East India Company (VOC) on 6 November 1778, the so-called Van Plettenberg Beacon. Since then, the place where it was erected is called Plettenberg Bay. The Plettenberg Bay area was rich in natural forests. Plettenberg was worried about these forests and suggested that a control post be erected to prevent the over-use of the timber. The Dutch East India Company started a woodcutter‚Äôs post in 1778. JF Meeding was appointed the first overseer of this post. In 1786 Johann Jacob Jerling was contracted to build a Timber Store for storage of the timber.

Although no unclassified sources indicate that AMC has activated the group, a patch published at USAF Patches.com implies that the group was active in Spain during Operation Iraqi Freedom.The patch incorporates a map of Spain, the colors of the Spanish Flag, and Don Quixote as its main elements. The group was originally activated in 1943 as the 494th Bombardment Group. It was the last B-24 Liberator group formed by the United States Army Air Forces. The unit served primarily in Western Pacific, taking part in numerous campaigns. It earned the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation for its actions during the liberation of the Philippines.

The 494th was subsequently the last heavy bomb group formed and trained by the Army Air Forces. The group's origins begin when the 10th Antisubmarine Squadron moved to Gowen Field, Idaho to retrain as a heavy bombardment unit with B-24s. At Gowen, the unit was renamed the 867th BS and moved to Wendover Field, Utah where it was joined by the newly activated 864th, 865th and 866th BS. The headquarters element of the group was formed from the staff of the 10th Antisubmarine Squadron. The group trained at Wendover until April when the base was converted by Second Air Force for B-29 training. It moved to Mountain Home Army Air Field, Idaho to complete its final phase of training. At Mountain Home, the group received new very long range B-24J aircraft in early May. The group was dispatched to the Pacific, initially to Barking Sands Army Airfield in Hawaii. It flew from Idaho to Hamilton Field, California before its overseas movement. In Hawaii, the group received additional training in long range ocean navigation while the ground echelon of the group moved by rail to Seattle, then by troop ship to Hawaii, arriving in mid-June. The unit remained in Hawaii throughout the summer of 1944 while its B-24s were modified at Hickam Field to meet the standards required by Seventh Air Force. Modifications were completed by 1 August, however the group was not deployed to the Southwest Pacific Area until mid-September as its planned airfield on Angaur in the Palau Islands was not yet constructed due to ongoing combat on the island. Aircraft were deployed from Hawaii on 10 October 1944, departing for Johnston Island, Kwajalein and Saipan. At Saipan, the unit was delayed a further 10 days due to combat ongoing in the Pelelieus. On Saipan, the 494th flew their first combat mission with crews of the 30th Bombardment Group, stationed on Saipan. The first elements of the 494th arrived on Angaur on 16 October, being strafed by Japanese forces still on the island as the battle of Bloody-Nose Ridge was still ongoing. As the area was finally secured in late October, additional aircraft began arriving; with the group completely established by the end of the month. The combat on the island had not allowed the construction of buildings and other support facilities, so the personnel of the group were engaged in construction activities upon their arrival. The 494th entered combat on 3 November 1944 with attacks against Japanese airfields on Yap and Koror. Subsequently, the group engaged in very long range strategic bombing raids on other bypassed Japanese installations in the Pacific and against the Japanese in the Philippines. Late in 1944 the unit hit gun emplacements, personnel areas, ant storage depots on Corregidor and Caballo at the entrance to Manila Bay. It bombed radio installations and power plants at Japanese bases in the Philippines and attacked enemy-held airfields, including Clark Field on Luzon. Early in 1945 it struck airfields on Mindanao and ammunition and supply dumps in the Davao Gulf and Illana Bay areas. The group moved to the newly built Yontan Airfield on Okinawa in June 1945. On Okinawa, the 373d Bombardment Squadron was assigned to the 494th from the CBI.Maurer, Combat Squadrons. pp. 461‚Äì462 From its new base, the group engaged primarily in very long range attacks against enemy airfields on Ky≈´sh≈´. The group also participated in incendiary raids, dropped propaganda leaflets over urban areas of Ky≈´sh≈´ and struck airfields in China, in southern Korea, and around the Inland Sea of Japan until the Japanese capitulation in August. After the war's end in September, the unit remained on Okinawa as older units began to demobilize. The group was engaged in transporting personnel and supplies in the Southwest Pacific, and moving necessary occupation support elements from Manila to Tokyo. It began to demobilize in November and December, with personnel returning to the United States. the 494th was inactivated as a paper unit in the United States on 4 January 1946. =Strategic Air Command= Patch with 4245th Strategic Wing emblem 4245th Strategic Wing The origins of the 494th Bombardment Wing began on 5 January 1959 when Strategic Air Command (SAC) established the 4245th Strategic Wing as a tenant at Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas, an Air Training Command baseMueller, pp. 537‚Äì544 and assigned it to the 816th Air Division (later 816th Strategic Aerospace Division) as part of SAC's plan to disperse its Boeing B-52 Stratofortress heavy bombers over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike. The wing remained a headquarters only until 1 August 1959, when the 61st Aviation Depot Squadron was activated to oversee the wing's special weapons. Two months later, three maintenance squadrons and a squadron to provide security for special weapons were activated and assigned to the wing. The 4245th finally added its first operational squadron on 1 February 1960 when the 717th Bombardment Squadron (BS), consisting of 15 Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses moved to Sheppard from Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota where it had been one of the three squadrons of the 28th Bombardment Wing.Maurer, Combat Squadrons. pp. 716‚Äì717 The wing became fully operational on 1 October 1962 when the 900th Air Refueling Squadron, flying Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers, was organized and assigned to the wing. One third of the wing's aircraft were maintained on fifteen-minute alert, fully fueled, armed and ready for combat to reduce vulnerability to a Soviet missile strike. This was increased to half the wing's aircraft in 1962. The 4245th (and later the 494th) continued to maintain an alert commitment until it was inactivated. 494th Bombardment Wing In 1962, in order to perpetuate the lineage of many currently inactive bombardment units with illustrious World War II records, Headquarters SAC received authority from Headquarters USAF to discontinue its Major Command controlled (MAJCON) strategic wings that were equipped with combat aircraft and to activate Air Force controlled (AFCON) units, most of which were inactive at the time, which could carry a lineage and history.MAJCON units could not carry a permanent history or lineage. Ravenstein, Guide to Air Force Lineage and Honors, p. 12 As a result, the 4245th SW was replaced by the newly constituted 494th Bombardment Wing, Heavy (BW), which assumed its mission, personnel, and equipment on 1 February 1963.Although the 494th Wing was a new organization, it continued, through temporary bestowal, the history, and honors of the World War II 494th Bombardment Group. It was also entitled to retain the honors (but not the history or lineage) of the 4245th. This temporary bestowal ended in January 1984, when the wing and group were consolidated into a single unit. Ravenstein, Combat Wings, Appendix V, USAF Bestowed History In the same way the 864th Bombardment Squadron, one of the unit's World War II historical bomb squadrons, replaced the 717th BS. The 61st Munitions Maintenance Squadron and the 900th Air Refueling Squadron were reassigned to the 494th. The 4245th's maintenance and security squadrons were replaced by ones with the 494th numerical designation of the newly established wing. Each of the new units assumed the personnel, equipment, and mission of its predecessor. Under the Dual Deputate organization,Under this plan flying squadrons reported to the wing Deputy Commander for Operations and maintenance squadrons reported to the wing Deputy Commander for Maintenance all flying and maintenance squadrons were directly assigned to the wing, so no operational group element was activated. The 494th Bomb Wing continued to conduct strategic bombardment training and air refueling operations to meet SAC's operational commitments. By 1966, Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) had been deployed and become operational as part of the United States' strategic triad, and the need for B-52s had been reduced. In addition, funds were also needed to cover the costs of combat operations in Indochina. The 494th Bombardment Wing was inactivated on 1 April 1966 and its aircraft were reassigned to other SAC units.

The Chronica is the seminal work of Matthew Paris, a member of the English Benedictine community of St Albans and long- celebrated historian. The work begins with Creation and contains annals down to the year of Matthew's death, 1259. Written in Latin, the illustrated autograph copy of the Chronica survives in three volumes. The first two parts, covering Creation up to 1188 as well as the years 1189 to 1253 (MS 26 and MS 16), are contained in the Parker Library at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.Parker Library on the web: MS 26, MS 16I, MS 16II 362 x 244/248 mm. ff 141 + 281 The remainder of the Chronica, from 1254 until Matthew's death in 1259, is in the British Library, bound as Royal MS 14 C VII folios 157‚Äì218, following Matthew's Historia Anglorum (an abridgement of the Chronica covering the period from 1070 to 1253). The Chronica is also renowned for its author's unprecedented use of archival and documentary material. These sources, amounting to over 200 items, include charters dating back to the eighth century,Chronica Majora, vol. 6, pp. 1‚Äì62 the rights of St Albans, a dossier relating to the canonisation of St Edmund of Canterbury and even a documented list of precious gems and artefacts in possession of St Albans.Chronica Majora, vol. 6, pp. 383‚Äì92 This exhaustive list of material required its own appendix which later became a separate volume, the Liber Additamentorum. The Chronica is one of the most important surviving documents for the history of Latin Europe.Bjorn Weiler, 'Matthew Paris on the Writing of History', Journal of Medieval History 35:3 (2006), p. 255. Despite its focus on England, Matthew's work extends to regions as far afield as Norway, Hungary, and Sicily as well as the crusader states. It continues to be mined for its coverage of the Mongol invasions, its detailed report of the conflict between Fredrick II and successive popes, as well as its commentary on the outbreak of the Barons‚Äô War of 1258‚Äì67. In addition to Matthew's literary abilities, he was an accomplished draughtsman. The surviving manuscripts are considered to be the foremost examples of English Gothic Manuscript, and they include some of the earliest surviving maps of Britain and the Holy Land.  Methodology  During the late twelfth century, historians sought to differentiate between their own work and that of the monastic annal-writers. Gervase of Canterbury, whose work influenced Matthew Paris's writing, wrote the following in 1188: > \\"The historian proceeds diffusely and elegantly, whereas the chronicler > proceeds simply, gradually and briefly. The Chronicler computes the years > Anno Domini and months kalends, and briefly describes the actions of kings > and princes which occurred at those times; he also commemorates events, > portents and wonders.\\"Gervase of Canterbury, in Suzanne Lewis, The Art of > Matthew Paris in the Chronica Majora (California, 1987), p.11. Although Matthew stands alone in the breadth of his research and in his illustrations, his writing is characteristic of thirteenth-century attempts to synthesize and consolidate historical writing, by broadening the annalistic genre into a more universal form of expression.Lewis, The Art of Matthew Paris, p.10. This process of evolution helps to account for the quasi- journalistic structure of the Chronica. Matthew set out to shape the work in a chronological order, but it developed into a multi-layered pastiche because he continued the monastic practices of revising and augmenting entries retrospectively. Suzanne Lewis claims that Roger of Wendover, Matthew's predecessor, had a resounding influence on Matthew's works.Lewis, The Art of Matthew Paris, p. 12. Matthew's Chronica was largely a continuation of Roger's annals up to 1235 with the occasional addition of phrases and anecdotes for dramatic effect.Lewis, The Art of Matthew Paris, p.13. However, Matthew went beyond what was customary by his very extensive inclusion of sources and evidences. Although it had long been usual to include the texts of documents in Christian historical narratives, the Chronica incorporated a hitherto unparalleled amount of such material. In addition, the number of changes made to the Chronica suggests that Matthew adapted and reworked much of his material, and in so molding it he enlarged both his own role as author and the historiographical nature of his writing.  Historiography  Matthew's status as an historian has long been the subject of academic debate. While many maintain that Matthew never intended to be a \\"humble compiler of dated events\\" (as Lewis explains), some still regard his work as a cumbersome annalistic production.Lewis, The Art of Matthew Paris, p.11. Lewis observed that, in the Chronica, \\"the downfall of a great king must compete for attention with the birth of a two-headed calf.\\" Matthew placed great importance on reference to portents and marvels, notably in his preface and in the closing pages of the Chronica. The latter contained a list of marvels which he claimed to have occurred over a fifty-year period.Weiler, 'Matthew Paris', p. 259. Such reporting was undoubtedly rooted in the Latin models, such as Cicero, who influenced both Matthew and his contemporaries. In Classical writings a moral polemic was often achieved by presenting narratives exemplifying good and evil for the edification of the reader. This convention is woven into the Chronica with great dexterity by Matthew. He posed rhetorical questions concerning the deeds and actions of people and why such things warranted being written down. In the eyes of Matthew, who was a conservative Benedictine monk, signs and portents forwarned of famine and other miseries that would befall humanity in retribution for their sins. In essence Matthew believed that history, and the sinful actions that forged it, would prompt sinners to hasten quickly to seek God's forgiveness. To Matthew, history was a matter of moral instruction and a means to provide guidance to the earthly and celestial well-being of God's people. Matthew saw the reporting of history as a platform through which the mistakes of men could be presented as a lesson from which to learn. From his treatment of the Jews to his coverage of the Mongol invasion, Matthew wrote from a position of self-interest.Lewis, The Art of Matthew Paris, p.14. He tended to distort history and his source material in order to preserve the integrity of his abbey and kingdom.Weiler, 'Matthew Paris', p. 269. What has been agreed upon is that the Chronica, at the very least, provides insight into what history meant to contemporaries and how they used it to reconcile their place within their world. It provides an encyclopedic history of the affairs of his community and an unprecedented number of insightful sources and documents which would never otherwise have survived.  The Wandering Jew  The Wandering Jew in the Chronica Majora Matthew Paris's Chronica Majora contains one of the first extant descriptions and images of the Wandering Jew, a legendary figure who struck and scolded Jesus on his way to the crucifixion, thereby becoming doomed to walk the earth until the Second Coming.Anderson, George K. \\"The Beginnings of the Legend.\\" The Legend of the Wandering Jew, Brown UP, 1965, pp. 11-37. The drawing of the Wandering Jew, likely done by Matthew Paris himself, embodies the paradoxical theological position of Jews in early and medieval Christianity as espoused by Augustine. Standing hunched over with a mattock (a symbol associated with Cain) behind Jesus as he progresses to Calvary, the depiction of the Wandering Jew represents the idea of Jewish sinfulness fixed throughout time as a contrast to Christ‚Äôs upright moral progression. The drawing also visualizes the notion of Christian supersessionism.Lampert-Weissig, Lisa. \\"The Time of the Wandering Jew in the Chronica Majora and the De Brailes Hours.\\" Philological Quarterly, vol. 96, no. 2, pp. 171-202.

However, most events and concepts occur in multiple, conflicting contexts and so confabulation yields a consensus of an expected event that may only be minimally more likely than many other events. However, given the winner take all constraint of the theory, that is the event/symbol/concept/attribute that is then expected. This parallel computation on many contexts is postulated to occur in less than a tenth of a second. Confabulation grew out of vector analysis of data retrieval like that of latent semantic analysis and support vector machines. It is currently used to detect credit card fraud. It is being implemented computationally on parallel computers.

It proclaims itself as \\"a weapon against injustice\\". S√©ptimo d√≠a first aired in 1996 on Canal Uno, when Caracol TV was still a production company. At the time it was presented by its creator, Manuel Teodoro, and Adriana Vargas. The show was successful, but also had to face a number of lawsuits, which was the reason Caracol TV pulled it off the air in 2000. Eventually, Caracol TV won all the legal suits. A new season of S√©ptimo d√≠a started on 10 June 2007, presented by Teodoro and Silvia Corzo. Since 1 May 2011, Mar√≠a Luc√≠a Fern√°ndez co-hosts the programme with Teodoro. In the Miami, Florida market, S√©ptimo d√≠a is broadcast by WGEN-TV on Sunday nights. Format The format is somewhat similar to CBS 60 Minutes, featuring three long-form news stories. S√©ptimo d√≠a usually undertakes its own investigations. Some episodes feature one or two stories; one story can also span multiple episodes. One of the stories deals with controversial issues, such as euthanasia, organ donations or even the Colombian armed conflict. As its American counterpart, many stories focus on allegations of wrongdoing and corruption, but instead of focusing politicians or corporations, S√©ptimo d√≠a deals with companies, businesses or persons who usually practice scams and who are denounced by the viewers. They are commonly either subjected to an interview, or try to evade contact with the S√©ptimo d√≠a crew altogether, either by written notice or by simply fleeing from the approaching journalist and their camera crew. The third story is often a more light-hearted report or a profile. Controversies on Season 2 On the episode broadcast 2 March 2008, S√©ptimo d√≠a denounced a corruption case at the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF), involving an employee who was asking for money in order to speed adoption processes up. The next week, Elvira Forero, director of ICBF, sent a letter to Paulo Laserna Phillips, CEO of Caracol TV, stating that the corruption case was presented in a \\"sensationalist\\" way. Ms Forero added that the case was already under investigation and that S√©ptimo d√≠a had broken a law forbidding media to broadcast or publish names and data \\"which identify or could lead to the identification of children and teenagers.\\" Carta a Paulo Laserna Phillips, Elvira Forero Hern√°ndez, Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar, 13 March 2008 On 25 April 2008, the involved employee was captured and later released Queda en libertad ex funcionaria acusada de cobrar por adopciones, Caracol Radio, 25 April 2008 because an error in the arrest procedure; she would be captured again two months later.

Teodoro interviewed a fellow journalist, living in Spain, who was beaten and kicked by Spaniard youngsters. The next day, the journalist called W Radio to denounce that Teodoro stated, by using the voice-over technique, in the episode broadcast the night before --which he watched on Caracol TV Internacional-- that he received intensive care and suffered several fractures, which, according to him, was not true.

Cartagena's police commander, Col. Carlos Mena Bravo, after being asked by journalist Gloria Lozano why foreigners are not searched when some parties allegedly known to involve drug use end at sunrise, replied \\"we do not want to bother the foreigners, if it is not because of the results of an investigative process of information we have received about this person may be possessing narcotics.\\" Caracol TV, S√©ptimo d√≠a: La ruta del vicio - part 2.1, 27 July 2008; transcription at Faabis.com: (07:27 - 08:24) Gloria Lozano: A las 6:00 de la ma√±ana, justo cuando empieza a amanecer se prenden las luces de la discoteca, la rumba termina.

In the following days, tourist guides demonstrated showing their contempt for the way they were depicted in the episode. The demonstrators were carrying banners, one of them reading \\"S√©ptimo d√≠a is a lie.\\" Juan Carlos D√≠az, Rebeli√≥n contra ‚ÄòSeptimo D√≠a‚Äô, El Heraldo, July 2008 They told Barranquilla-based El Heraldo newspaper that two men, claiming to be tourist guides, who told the journalists about where and who sold drugs were actually impostors. In a column published by El Colombiano newspaper, writer Pascual Gaviria criticized S√©ptimo d√≠a because \\"the tone [of the special report on Narcotourism] was of false surprise and permanent moral condemnation.\\" Pascual Gaviria, Calculada indignaci√≥n, El Colombiano, 2 August 2008 On 27 March 2011, S√©ptimo d√≠a dealt with the case of Sandra/Alexander, born in 1972 with ambiguous genitalia (micropenis) and who had his testicles surgically removed, with the knowledge of her/his parents following the advice of Dr. Efraim Bonilla Arciniegas, who would be later considered the \\"father of pediatric surgery\\" in Colombia. Such was the then state of art procedure for these cases at the time. Dr. Bonilla was interviewed by S√©ptimo d√≠a reporter Susana Suesc√∫n, who did not initially tell him about the specific case he dealt with more than 30 years before. The episode included an interview with a former member of the Medical Ethics Tribunal, who stated that the surgery was a \\"fatal mistake.\\" During the episode, which focused in the suffering of Sandra/Alexander after having found out he was actually a man, following years of being raised as a woman, the journalists heavily criticized Dr. Bonilla, claiming he was \\"playing to be God\\". The episode prompted dozens of complaints by fellow physicians and medicine students, with several institutions such as Hospital de la Misericordia (a pediatric hospital where Dr. Bonilla works), the Colombian Society of Pediatric Surgery, and the Colombian Surgery Association, among others, sending letters of protest to the network. The episode was analysed on the 14 April 2011 episode of Doble v√≠a (a programme of the Caracol TV defensor√≠a del televidente [viewer ombudswoman's office]), where Amparo P√©rez, the network's viewer ombudswoman, stated that \\"a more accurate look from the point of view of medicine\\" was missing on the S√©ptimo d√≠a episode. On the 17 April 2011 episode, S√©ptimo d√≠a issued a clarification, recognizing that when contacting Dr. Bonilla they did not specifically tell him about the case, and broadcasting excerpts of a second interview with Dr. Bonilla (on his request) which was not broadcast 27 March, where the physician clarifies why did he recommended the procedure, citing the pioneering surgery work by endocrinologists from Johns Hopkins Hospital, such as doctor John Money, and explaining the controversies in the medical community which followed. Suesc√∫n also travelled to Quito, Ecuador, trying to interview a physician who had continued with the treatment for Sandra/Alexander, after the family moved to that city.

The family's estate was in Popovo Polje. They were of minor importance, serving under Grand Dukes of Bosnia and noble families of Hraniƒá and Kosaƒça, lords of Hum and later Herzegovina. History The progenitor of the family was Nikola, a ≈æupan or knez. Nikola had two sons by Katarina, the daughter of Stephen I, Ban of Bosnia: Vladislav and Bogi≈°a. Little is known about the first ancestors of the Nikoliƒá family, though they were most likely important family in Hum, with princess Vukosava, Petar and Mili≈°a Nikoliƒá probably being the second generation of the Nikoliƒá family. The first mention of the Nikoliƒá brothers happened after the death of King Tvrtko I of Bosnia in 1391. Loyal to the new Bosnian king, Stephen Dabi≈°a, they were granted Republic of Dubrovnik citizenship by 1392. After ascension of the rival king to Bosnian Kingdom throne, namely Stephen Ostoja, the Nikoliƒá brothers, also related to Queen Jelena Gruba who was of the House of Nikoliƒá herself and widow of Stephen Dabi≈°a, were forced to take refuge in Dubrovnik. Later Vukosav participated in the Bosnian-Ragusan War around 1403 as a nobleman of the Grand Duke of Bosnia Sandalj Hraniƒá, and was killed and was buried in Ston on 28 November 1403. Grgur Vukosaliƒá, the son of Vukosav Nikoliƒá, was present at historical events in Bosnia in the course of Tvrtko II's campaign against King Stephen Ostoja and his own lord and Grad Duke of Bosnia, Sandalj Hraniƒá. To no avail the Nikoliƒá family tried to gain independence from the Bosnian duke, and after Hraniƒá's death they remained loyal to his successor as the Grad Duke of Bosnia, Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça, as well. Grgur died in July 1436. The sons of Grgur Vukosaliƒá, Vuk and Vuka≈°in Grgureviƒá, maintained their position under Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça, as the Grand Duke tried to overtake Zeta. In 1442 Vukasin fell into Venetian captivity, but with Dubrovnik help he was released. The last mention of the Nikoliƒá family was in 1453, and they were still under the lordship of Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça. The Ottoman Empire had already entered area of Vrhbosna and prepared conquest of rest of the Bosnian Kingdom, which will occur 10 years later. Finally, after decades of political and social instability, Bosnia officially fell in 1463. Herzegovina would follow in 1482, with a Hungarian-backed reinstated Bosnian state around former capital Jajce being the last to succumb in 1527. After the end of Bosnian medieval state, Nikoliƒá's fate is little known until the 18th century.

Hence they were commonly called Prayers after Mass.\\"Prayers after Mass\\" in The Tablet, 26 November 1904Pope, Charles. \\"Prayers after Mass\\", Our Sunday Visitor, May 8, 2013 The name \\"Leonine\\" derived from the fact that they were initially introduced by Pope Leo XIII. They were slightly modified under Pope Pius X. The intention for which the prayers were offered changed over time. Originally they were offered for the defence of the temporal sovereignty of the Holy See. After this problem was settled with the Lateran Treaty of 1929, Pope Pius XI ordered them to be said for the restoration to the people of Russia of tranquillity and freedom to profess the Catholic faith. This gave rise to the unofficial use of the name \\"Prayers for the Conversion of Russia\\" for the prayers.\\"Handbook for Altar Servers\\", Archconfraternity of St. Stephen\\"Parts of the Traditional Latin Mass\\", St. Andrew's Daily Missal The final form of the Leonine Prayers consisted of three Ave Marias, a Salve Regina followed by a versicle and response, a prayer for the conversion of sinners and the liberty and exaltation of the Catholic Church, and a prayer to Saint Michael the Archangel. Pope Pius X permitted the addition of the invocation \\"Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on us\\", repeated three times. The Holy See's 26 September 1964 Inter Oecumenici which came into force on 7 March 1965, simply declared: \\"The Leonine Prayers are suppressed.\\" However, many celebrations of Mass in the 1962 form are still followed by the same prayers with some discussion surrounding the intention for which they are offered. History In 1859, Pope Pius IX, facing rebellion against his temporal sovereignty in the course of the Risorgimento, ordered that Masses celebrated in the Papal States be followed by three Ave Marias, a Salve Regina, a versicle and response, and a collect. He did not make these prayers obligatory in other countries, but did ask Catholics everywhere to pray for the defeat of those bent on destroying the Holy See's temporal sovereignty.Qui nuper, 18 June 1859, PapalEncyclicalsOnline On 6 January 1884, in the context of anti- clerical political and social developments in the new Kingdom of Italy, Pope Leo XIII ordered that the prayers be recited throughout the world.This instruction was published by a decree Iam inde ab anno of the Sacred Congregation of Rites, published in Acta Sanctae Sedis 16 (1884), pages 249‚Äì250. In 1886, the prayer that follows the Salve Regina was modified to make it a prayer for the conversion of sinners and \\"the freedom and exaltation of Holy Mother Church\\". The prayer to Saint Michael was added at the same time.Russia and the Leonine Prayers Two slight changes were made later to the prayer after the Salve Regina, and in 1904, Pope Pius X granted permission to add at the conclusion of the Leonine Prayers a threefold invocation, \\"Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on us\\", a permission that was universally availed of.DiMillo, Kevin. \\"How the Leonine Prayers Helped Create the Vatican State and Crushed the Soviet Union\\". National Catholic Register, May 4, 2016 In 1929, the state of Vatican City was created, resolving the troubled relationship between the Holy See and the Italian state, which had been the object of the Leonine Prayers, and thus removing their raison d'√™tre. But the following year, Pope Pius XI ordered that the Leonine Prayers should be offered \\"to permit tranquillity and freedom to profess the faith to be restored to the afflicted people of Russia\\".Allocution Indictam ante of 30 June 1930, in Acta Apostolicae Sedis 22 (1930), p.301 The 26 September 1964 Instruction Inter Oecumenici on implementing the Constitution on Sacred Liturgy of the Second Vatican Council decreed: \\"The Leonine Prayers are suppressed\\".Inter Oecumenici The Leonine Prayers, being prayers after Low Mass, not prayers of the Mass, were never inserted into the Roman Missal and do not appear in the typical editions that followed their imposition, that of Pope Benedict XV in 1920 and that of Pope John XXIII in 1962, nor of course in the post-Vatican II editions that followed their suppression. Rubrics According to the original decree of 6 January 1884 that imposed the Leonine Prayers, they were to be said after every Low Mass, but later decrees, whose interpretation was not always clear, spoke rather of \\"private Masses\\", what in present-day legislation are called Masses without the people. According to one influential rubricist, the Leonine Prayers could be omitted after a Low Mass that was celebrated with special solemnity, such as an ordination or funeral Mass, a First Friday Votive Mass of the Sacred Heart, a Nuptial Mass, or the Mass after distribution of the ashes on Ash Wednesday, or if the Mass was followed immediately by function such as Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament or a Novena.J.

He was an important Jewish leader and one of the people who established the Jewish Community in Porto and assisted the construction of the Kadoorie Synagogue, the biggest Synagogue in Iberian Peninsula. Furthermore, he helped the return of Crypto-Jews to the Jewish people and, during World War II, helped Jewish refugees escape the Holocaust. Life and work When Barros Basto was still young his dying grandfather revealed to him that he had Jewish ancestors. His family had not kept the Jewish precepts and so he became aware of the existence of Jews in Portugal only in 1904; the year he read a newspaper article referring to the inauguration of the synagogue Shaar√© Tikva, in Lisbon. Years later, he joined the army, and when ordered to attend a course at the Escola Polit√©cnica de Lisboa (Technical School of Lisbon), the young Barros Basto went to the synagogue of the city in an attempt to be admitted there. The leaders of the synagogue didn‚Äôt give him permission but Barros Basto wouldn‚Äôt give up. When the Republic was established in 1910 Barros Bastos was the one who raised the Republican flag in the city of Porto. During the First World War, as a lieutenant of the army he commanded a battalion of the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps in the front of Flanders. For his acts of bravery and honor on the battlefield he was awarded medals and promoted to captain. Barros Basto was self-taught, and after learning Hebrew he lived for a while in Morocco where he began a formal process of conversion to Judaism (known in Hebrew as Giur). This process completed when he was circumcised in Tangier and later subjected to a rabbinical court (Beit Din).Mea, Elvira de Azevedo e Steinhardt, In√°cio - Ben-Rosh. Biografia do Capit√£o Barros Basto, Lisboa: Afrontamento, 1997. After which he changed his name to Abraham Israel Ben-Rosh. Back in Lisbon, he married Lea Israel Montero Azancot, of the Jewish Community of Lisbon, with whom he had a son and a daughter. He also had several grandchildren and great-grandchildren; his granddaughter, Isabel Ferreira Lopes, is the current vice president of the Jewish Community of Porto. He is also great-granduncle of the actress Daniela Ruah. Lea Azancot and Barros Basto In 1921 he returned to Porto with his wife. At that time Barros Basto realized that there were fewer than twenty Ashkenazi Jews living in the city. As there wasn‚Äôt a synagogue in Porto these Jews were not organized and had to travel to Lisbon for religious purposes whenever necessary. Upon learning that reality he began to think about building a synagogue and took initiative in 1923, by officially registering the Jewish Community of the Porto and the Israelite Theological Center in the City Council of Porto. The current building of the synagogue was built years later but the community was organized and rented a house on the street Elias Garcia, which started to function as a synagogue. As time went on, more and more people started to appear in the synagogue. They said they were descendants of Jews forced to convert in the 15th century and claimed to maintain alive yet some Jewish practices and rituals, in the secrecy of their homes. These people, the crypto-Jews, began to participate in religious services. In 1927, he founded and directed the Portuguese Jewish Newspaper called Ha-Lapid. The claims of the crypto-Jews were proved true by Barros Basto and the committee of London, who found that they did not lie about their origins since they proved to still keep prayers to Hashem and respect the Sabbath as their ancestors. It should also be noted that on the Act n. ¬∫ 68 Directorate (Ma√¢mad) of the Jewish Community of Porto it was written that anyone who could \\"absolutely prove their Jewish origin.\\" would be admitted into the congregation. Barros Basto This occurrence sparked Barros Basto‚Äôs interest, who therefore, decided to visit frequently the villages and towns of the Tr√°s os Montes and Beiras regions, looking for more people interested in returning to Judaism.Schwarz, Samuel. - Os crist√£os-novos em Portugal no s√©culo XX. Lisboa: Instituto de Sociologia e Etnologia das Religi√µes, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, 1993. This measure gained the attention of some people, especially some Jewish communities, as is the case of the Community of Portuguese Jews in London, who created the \\"Portuguese Marranos Committee\\", an organization dedicated to help people who wanted to return to Judaism. With the change of regime in the 1930s, Barros Basto was associated with the opposition, and was soon being chased by the army. He started to be placed in locations farther away from Porto, in an attempt to push him away from the Synagogue and the Community. In 1937, Barros Basto was adjudicated by the Disciplinary Board of the Army and was dismissed from the institution for allegedly participating in circumcision ceremonies (in Hebrew, brit milah) of the students of the Israelite Theological Institute of Porto, which the Council considered \\"immoral\\" act, which is actually a fundamental practice for the Jewish people. A year later, in 1938, Barros Basto saw the inauguration of his great project, the Kadoorie Synagogue in Porto. Its construction was started in 1929 when Barros Basto was able to gather funds to buy land and build. This became the headquarters of the Jewish Community of Porto and still retains its religious functions. During World War II, having been already dismissed from the army, Barros Basto helped hundreds of Jews escape the war and the Holocaust, allowing them to start a new life elsewhere. Recently the Jewish Community of Porto signed a protocol with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in order to provide it with thousands of documents and records of individual refugees, who with the help of Barros Basto could then rebuild their lives with a start point in Porto. He died in 1961, and was, according to his wish, buried in Amarante, the city where he was born. He was wearing the uniform with which he always served his country. On his deathbed he said that one day there would be justice, but this justice only would come in 2012, over 50 years after his death. Rehabilitation Following a petition presented to Parliament on 31 October 2011 by his granddaughter, Isabel Ferreira Lopes, the name of Barros Basto was rehabilitated to February 29, 2012. The petition, which was approved unanimously by all political parties, presents the conclusion that Barros Basto‚Äôs dismissal from the army was a matter of political and religious segregation on account of being Jewish. \\"Barros Basto was separated from the Army due to a general climate of animosity against him motivated by the fact of being a Jew\\" - can be read in the document that the LUSA news agency had access to. In turn, the Resolution of the Assembly of the Republic n. ¬∫ 119/2012, of 10-08, urged the government to undertake a symbolic reintegration of Barros Basto in the Army, posthumously, \\"by no means in a category lower than the person concerned would have been entitled to had he not been dismissed\\" Isabel Ferreira Lopes, granddaughter of Barros Basto and Vice President of the Jewish Community of Porto stated to LUSA that after the rehabilitation of her grandfather‚Äôs memory, the next step was the rehabilitation of Porto‚Äôs synagogue: \\"In the year of the rehabilitation of the founder of the Jewish Community of Porto the synagogue shall as well be rehabilitated.‚Äù  See also  *Kadoorie Synagogue *Lisbon Synagogue *Jewish Communities of Portugal *History of the Jews in Portugal *Crypto-Jews *Ha- Lapid  References   External links  * ADL Welcomes Reinstatement of Captain Ousted from Portuguese Army Due to Anti-Semitism *Jewish Community of Porto website *The Synagogue of the Portuguese Dreyfus Creates a YouTube Success Category:Sephardi Jews Category:Portuguese Jews Category:Crypto- Judaism Category:Jewish activists Category:Jewish military personnel Category:Portuguese military officers Category:1887 births Category:1961 deaths Category:People from Amarante, Portugal Category:Recipients of the Cruz de Guerra ","title":"Artur Carlos de Barros Basto"},{"id":"14923841","text":"Nadiya Ke Paar () is a 1982 Indian Awadhi-language drama film directed by Govind Moonis (Dube).

The district is composed of 51 buildings on or within a block of Main Street. Although many of the storefronts have been remodeled over the years, the original decorative brickwork is still visible on the upper levels of most buildings. With History Main Street is the oldest street in Fort Atkinson. It was originally part of a military road that connected Fort Dearborn to Fort Winnebago. The first white settlers arrived in the 1830s and settled on both sides of the Rock River. Soon after, a wooden bridge was built linking North and South Main Streets. From the 1840s to the 1870s, Main Street had mostly wood frame stores with wide shingled canopies resting on wooden posts. In the 1880s these small frame shops gave way to the buildings that exist today - two and three story brick buildings constructed with local cream brick, and adorned with fancy cornices and dentils. Canvas awnings replaced wooden canopies. Main street bridge There have been three bridges crossing the Rock River at this location. Prior to the building of the first one in 1843, people and wagons would attempt to ford the river or were ferried across. City founder Dwight Foster operated the first ferry service using rafts and dugout canoes. The first bridge was a flimsy wooden structure built by local pioneers with material that were at hand. In 1870 an iron bridge costing $9,400 replaced it. A second iron bridge was built in 1881. In 1909 this structure was widened, with an elevated bandstand in the shape of a stockade constructed in the center. The present concrete bridge was built in 1917. Notable buildings The buildings include: * The Albert Winslow Grocery at 131 N Main St was built in 1857, three-story brick Italianate-styled, with fancy metal lintels over the windows.

EP finds approximations to a probability distribution. It uses an iterative approach that leverages the factorization structure of the target distribution. It differs from other Bayesian approximation approaches such as variational Bayesian methods. More specifically, suppose we wish to approximate an intractable probability distribution p(\\\\mathbf{x}) with a tractable distribution q(\\\\mathbf{x}). Expectation propagation achieves this approximation by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence \\\\mathrm{KL}(pq). Variational Bayesian methods minimize \\\\mathrm{KL}(qp) instead. If q(\\\\mathbf{x}) is a Gaussian \\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\mu, \\\\Sigma), then \\\\mathrm{KL}(pq) is minimized with \\\\mu and \\\\Sigma being equal to the mean of p(\\\\mathbf{x}) and the covariance of p(\\\\mathbf{x}), respectively; this is called moment matching.

Life and career  Born in San Antonio, Texas, the second child of Jewish immigrants, Bates showed musical talent as a child, but a hand injury inhibited her from continuing her piano studies. In 1906, she graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in mathematics, after which she taught school. In 1909, she met and married her first husband and gave up her career to raise their daughter. When that marriage ended in divorce, she began to study law and, in 1914 at the age of 26, passed the bar examination. She was the first female lawyer in her home state and practiced law for four years in San Antonio. After the death of her parents, Bates left the legal profession to help her sister operate their father's antique business. She became a bilingual (English‚ÄîSpanish) radio commentator whose program was designed to foster good relations between the United States and Mexico. In 1929, following the stock market crash and the death of her sister, Florence closed the antique shop and married a wealthy businessman, William F. Jacoby. When he lost his fortune, the couple moved to Los Angeles and opened a bakery, which proved a successful venture. They sold it in the 1940s. Laurence Olivier, Florence Bates and Joan Fontaine in Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940) In the mid-1930s, Bates auditioned for and won the role of Miss Bates in a Pasadena Playhouse adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma. When she decided to continue working with the theater group, she changed her professional name to that of the first character she played on stage. In 1939, she was introduced to Alfred Hitchcock, who cast her in her first major screen role, the widowed Mrs. Van Hopper, in Rebecca (1940). Bates appeared in more than 60 films over the course of the next 13 years. Among her cinema credits are Kitty Foyle, Love Crazy, The Moon and Sixpence, Mr. Lucky, Heaven Can Wait, Lullaby of Broadway, Mister Big, Since You Went Away, Kismet, Saratoga Trunk, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Winter Meeting, I Remember Mama, Portrait of Jennie, A Letter to Three Wives, On the Town, and Les Mis√©rables. In television, Bates had a regular role on The Hank McCune Show and made guest appearances on I Love Lucy, My Little Margie, I Married Joan Joan Davis Channel, YouTube, 2 episodes: \\"Ballet\\" and \\"Lost Check\\" and Our Miss Brooks.

It is also known locally as Powder House Circle. It is the 6-way intersection of College Avenue, Broadway, Warner Street, and Powder House Boulevard. Powder House Square stands at the southern tip of Tufts University's main Somerville/Medford campus, and borders the northern edge of Nathan Tufts Park. The square takes its name from the 18th century Powder House which overlooks the rotary from Nathan Tufts Park. Powder House Square was home to one of the first hostile acts of the American Revolutionary War. The removal of colonial gunpowder by British soldiers, and the massive popular reaction known as Powder Alarm that ensued, are considered to be a turning point in the events leading up to war.  History  Broadway was one of the earliest highways running through what would later become Somerville, originating in the 17th century. Originally called \\"Menotomie's Road,\\" it ran from Charlestown to the settlement at Menotomy (present-day Arlington). Powder House Boulevard was created in 1900, extending northwest from Broadway at Nathan Tufts Park. According to a plaque placed at the center of the rotary island, the circle was dedicated in 1940 as the James A. Reynolds Traffic Circle, in honor of a Tufts College professor. =Old Powder House= Somerville's Old Powder House as it appeared in 2015 First built for use as a windmill by John Mallet in the early 1703 or 1704, the Old Powder House was sold to the colonial government of Massachusetts for use as a gunpowder magazine in 1747. It is the oldest stone building in Massachusetts. Located at the intersection of Broadway and College Avenue in present-day Powder House Square, the Old Powder House held the largest supply of gunpowder in the colony. General Thomas Gage, who had become the military governor of Massachusetts in May 1774, was charged with enforcement of the highly unpopular Intolerable Acts, which the British Parliament had passed in response to the Boston Tea Party. Seeking to prevent the outbreak of war, he believed that the best way to accomplish this was by secretly removing military stores from storehouses and arsenals in New England. The Old Powder House as it stood in 1935 atop the hill at Nathan Tufts Park, overlooking Powder House Square =Powder Alarm= Just after dawn on September 1, 1774, a force of roughly 260 British regulars from the 4th Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Maddison, were rowed in secrecy up the Mystic River from Boston to a landing point near Winter Hill. From there they marched about a mile to the Powder House, and after sunrise removed all of the gunpowder. Most of the regulars then returned to Boston the way they had come, but a small contingent marched on to Cambridge, seizing two field pieces from the Cambridge Common.Fischer, pp. 44‚Äì45 The field pieces and powder were then taken from Boston to the British stronghold on Castle Island, then known as Castle William (renamed Fort Independence in 1779). In response to the raid, amid rumors that blood had been shed, alarm spread through the countryside as far as Connecticut and beyond, and American Patriots sprang into action, fearing that war was at hand. Thousands of militiamen began streaming toward Boston and Cambridge, and mob action forced Loyalists and some government officials to flee to the protection of the British Army. This action provided a \\"dress rehearsal\\" for the Battles of Lexington and Concord seven months later in the famous \\"shot heard 'round the world\\". This did however, inflame already heated feelings on both sides and would spur actions by both British and American forces to secure both powder and cannon to secure locations. =After the Revolutionary War= Massachusetts began storing gunpowder elsewhere and sold the land containing the Powder House to Peter Tufts in 1818. The estate, known as the Powder House Farm, was used as a farm and residence for the Tufts family for most of the 19th century, passing to Peter's heir, Nathan Tufts. Incidentally, another Tufts relative Charles Tufts donated the land across Broadway on the Somerville/Medford line to found Tufts College (now Tufts University). The college was founded in 1852, on Walnut Hill slightly to the north of present-day Powder House Square. In the 1870s, a pickle and condiment manufacturer named George Emerson began making pickles nearby, housing his business in a large shed that he moved to the property from another location in Somerville. The powder house itself, with its two- foot thick stone walls, was well-insulated and made a perfect place for storing Emerson's \\"Old Powder House Brand\\" pickles. The descendants of Nathan Tufts donated the Powder House Farm along with its namesake structure to the city in 1890, and from this Nathan Tufts Park was established in 1893. The Field House was constructed in 1935-36 using stones from the 1934-demolished Somerville Highlands railroad station, which had closed in 1927 when passenger service on the Fitchburg Cutoff ended. Sponsored by the Federal Relief Administration as a Work Projects Administration Project, it has served many purposes over the years, including as an office for the Draft Board, then for the Traffic and Parking Department, and most recently as a Youth Program center. The building underwent significant repairs and restoration work both inside and outside during 2001-2002, and is now available for public use by petition. In celebration of its 100th birthday, the City of Somerville (whose seal had previously depicted George Washington) created a new city seal, featuring the Powder House. Overlooking Powder House Square from the hill at Nathan Tufts Park. Tufts University is in the background. Nathan Tufts Park (along with the Powder House) was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, the first of many landmarks in Somerville to be added. The City of Somerville designated the park a local historic district in 1985. An accidental fire damaged the Powder House in 1998, leading to extensive repairs and renovations in 2000-2001. =Powder House Square today= Small bronze sculptured monuments can be seen around Nathan Tufts Park referring to the site's past uses as a farm, a mill, storage for gunpowder, and even a pickle factory.rightrightright A close-up view of the directory on the island of Powder House Square The island within the actual traffic circle is a tiny park on its own, complete with walkways, benches, and neatly arranged bushes and other flora. There is a large 360 degree directional post that points in the direction of dozens of different communities (like Arlington, Medford, and Winchester). Powder House Square is located less than a half mile from Davis Square, Teele Square and Ball Square in Somerville. It is served by MBTA buses 80 (Arlington Center/Lechmere), 89 (Clarendon Hill/Sullivan Square), 94 (Davis Square/Medford Square), and 96 (Harvard Station/Medford Square). Red Line subway service to Harvard Square and downtown Boston is conveniently close at Davis Square Station. Powder House Square is approximately one mile from Exit 31 of I-93. A proposed light-rail station at Ball Square, as part of the Green Line Extension project, would put Powder House Square within a half mile of the Green Line in addition to the Red Line station at Davis Square. Several businesses thrive on or around Powder House Square, including restaurants, several small medical and dental practices, and a funeral home.

Date and Place  The Yogini Tantra was written in Assam in the 16th or 17th century. The date is determined from the reference to the 16th-century Koch dynasty (kuvacha), who are said to have been born to a Mech woman.\\"The Yogini Trantra, which was composed in Assam itself in about the 16th century, refers to the Koches as kuvachas and says they were born of a Mech woman.\\" (Ch XII v3) Some authors place it in the 17th century.\\"(A)ccording to the Yogina Tantra‚Äîa product of seventeenth-century Assam‚Äîthe entire religion of Kamarupa is itself described as kirata dharma.

As a teenager Nicholas worked two days a week as a messenger for The Swan Inn, Eglwyswen (Whitechurch), Pembrokeshire, memorizing poetry while he worked. The Old Swan Inn, which closed as a pub in the 1920s, is now a holiday cottage. Nicholas' early upbringing was a deep and long-lasting influence on him : \\"It is often argued that the community of the Preseli Hills represented the socialist ideal for Niclas ‚Äì a community where people co-operated for each other‚Äôs good. It was a civilized society where ideas, stories, debates, sermons and politics were shared. There was a great deal of sharing of books and journals, too. Niclas was introduced to what was happening in Parliament by the newspaper Baner ac Amserau Cymru published by Thomas Gee.\\"'T.E. Nicholas', WCIA website, retrieved 17 Dec 2017. Training for the ministry and ordination Nicholas left Pembrokeshire in 1897 and worked briefly in Treherbert in the Rhondda, before studying for the ministry at the Gwynfryn Academy (Ysgol y Gwynfryn), Ammanford, under Watcyn Wyn (Watkin Hezekiah Williams) and John Gwili Jenkins. In 1901 he was ordained to the ministry among the Welsh Independents at Horeb Chapel, Llandeilo, in Carmarthenshire. Marriage and family In 1902, Nicholas married Mary Alys Hopkins, daughter of Thomas Hopkins, watchmaker, Ammanford. Their children included a son, Thomas Islwyn Nicholas (Islwyn ap Nicholas) (b. 1903) and two daughters, Gwladys Thelma (b. 1904) and Nellie Alys (b. 1911). Seion Chapel, Glais : ministry and writing In 1903, he was briefly minister of the Welsh Congregational Church at Dodgeville, Wisconsin, U.S.A. Between 1904 and 1914 he was minister of Seion Chapel in the village of Glais in the Swansea Valley, where Nicholas Road bears his name.From Warfare to Welfare : T. E. Nicholas (Niclas y Glais) (1879-1971), National Library of Wales, retrieved 28 Aug 2017 His religious convictions, influenced by Watcyn Wyn and Gwili, were focused on the radical message of the Gospels. He supported the socialism of R. J. Derfel with its emphasis on brotherhood, peace and justice, equality, land nationalisation, and a Parliament for Wales, and opposition to the royal family, the brewers and militarism. Nicholas became a favorite preacher at 'Cyrddau Mawr' (‚ÄòBig Meetings‚Äô) and a popular public speaker. In his own chapel at Glais he supported Welsh culture, establishing a choir and an eisteddfod. He was a prolific poet : his early poetry had religious themes but by 1908 his poems carried a socialist and radical message. He was known as ‚ÄòThe People's Poet‚Äô. He won over 17 eisteddfod chairs during his time at Glais.It has been estimated that he won some 50 eisteddfod chairs during his life: Mererid Hopwood in Gwlad Beirdd - Niclas y Glais, the 2013 SWC film. The main themes of his poetry were injustice, the battle between the working class and the power of capital, and pacifism. His poetry books and pamphlets - almost all written in Welsh - sold well: Weithwyr Cymru, Cenwch eich hunain i ryddid (‚ÄòWorkers of Wales, sing yourselves to freedom‚Äô) sold over 6000 copies. He also translated The Internationale into Welsh. Political, trade union and anti-war activities Nicholas joined the Independent Labour Party in 1905. He was a close friend and supporter of James Keir Hardie, the founder of the Independent Labour Party - Hardie had been elected as M.P. for the Welsh mining constituency of Merthyr Tydfil from 1900. Like Hardie, Nicholas was both a Christian socialist and a committed pacifist. Nicholas acted as Hardie's election agent in 1910Ivor Rees, ‚ÄòThomas Evan Nicholas, 1879 ‚Äì 1971‚Äô, The National Library of Wales Journal, Vol 35, No 1 (2010) at p. 3 and, at Hardie's request, Nicholas served as the first Welsh-language editor of the ILP‚Äôs Merthyr Pioneer from its first appearance in 1911. In January 1914 Nicholas left Glais to become Minister to two chapels in rural Ceredigion: Ebenezer, Llangybi, and Bethlehem, Llanddewi Brefi. When the First World War broke out, Hardie and Nicholas both opposed it. Within a few days of Britain going into the war Hardie was speaking against it in his own constituency but was shouted down by the crowd, who supported the war. Hardie died on 26 September 1915, aged only 59. Nicholas delivered the sermon at Hardie's memorial service at Aberdare. He continued to oppose the War throughout its duration.Waldo Williams, the Welsh poet and pacifist, recalled his father reading Nicholas's anti-war poem ‚ÄòGweriniaeth a Rhyfel‚Äô (Democracy and War) in 1916 : 'Williams, Waldo Goronwy (1904-1971)', Robert Rhys, Dictionary of Welsh Biography (2017). The authorities took an interest in his activities and sought evidence of treason. In the General Election of 1918, Nicholas was invited by the Labour Party to stand in the Aberdare division of Hardie's old Merthyr Tydfil seat, against Charles Butt Stanton (1873-1946). Stanton had won one of the two Merthyr Tydfil seats in the by-election caused by Hardie's death: he had supported the Coalition Government and the war; and fought the General Election as a member of the National Democratic Party (NDP) with the assistance of the Coalition 'coupon'. Nicholas campaigned on Hardie's socialist and pacifist positions. He was badly mistreated. He won 6,229 votes to Stanton's 22,824. However, he was heartened by the fact that the Labour Party greatly increased its vote share nationally (from 7% to 21%) and for the first time it won the most seats in Wales, breaking the long Liberal dominance. Nicholas took heart also from the Russian Revolution. In Ceredigion Nicholas organised farmworkers into a Union and in 1918 he established the Labour Party in the county. He resigned from the ministry in the same year. He and his wife and son, Islwyn ap Nicholas, set up a dental practice - first in Pontardawe and then, in 1921, in Aberystwyth. (They were trained as dentists by a good friend, David Ernest Evans (1870-1956) of Mountain Ash). In 1920, Nicholas joined the Communist Party of Great Britain when it was first formed. He was expelled from the Labour Party in 1926 after criticising Ramsay MacDonald's leadership. He continued as an active and popular lecturer, preacher, writer, columnist and poet. In the 1930s he wrote a weekly column, ‚ÄòO fyd y werin‚Äô (‚ÄòThe world of the people‚Äô) in Y Cymro newspaper. The Prison Sonnets In July 1940, during the Second World War, he and his son Islwyn were arrested on a trumped up charge of fascism.\\"The case against Nicholas was entirely trumped-up by local Conservative-leaning dignitaries and the local chief of police. It eventually transpired that the evidence against him consisted of little more than a set of miniature Nazi flags that he had acquired as a supplement to a recent issue of the Daily Express (Rees, 2010) or The Daily Telegraph (Thomas, G., 2004), the readers of which were supposed to use such flags to mark up a map showing the progress of the war ...\\" - Diarmait Mac Giolla Chr√≠ost (2013) 'T.E. Nicholas' in Welsh Writing, Political Action and Incarceration Palgrave Macmillan p 56. They were imprisoned first in Swansea prison and then in Brixton, where Nicholas wrote 150 sonnets expressing his Christian and Communist convictions. Protests against their imprisonment came from Ministers of religion, trade union leaders, especially the miners, and Members of Parliament. After four months in prison, they were released. Nicholas' prison sonnets (many written on toilet paper) were published in Llygad y Drws: Sonedau‚Äôr Carchar (Aberystwyth, 1940) and Canu‚Äôr Carchar (Llandysul, 1942) : they were translated into English by Daniel Hughes, Dewi Emrys and Wil Ifan as The Prison Sonnets of T. E. Nicholas (London, 1948). Llygad y Drws (\\"The Eye of the Door\\") refers to the eye-hole in the prison cell door. The National Library of Wales, which holds the manuscript of his prison poems, has placed them online (with an introduction).'Canu'r carchar': Prison Sonnets of T. E.

Nicholas died at home in Aberystwyth on 19 April 1971, aged 91. The funeral services were held at the Independent Chapel, Aberystwyth and Narberth Crematorium. His ashes were scattered on the Preseli Hills, Pembrokeshire. His papers are held in the T.E. Nicholas Archive at Bangor University. T.E. Nicholas was a pacifist, a Christian, a radical, a socialist, a Communist. He was an internationalist who loved the Welsh language and the culture of the Welsh people. His roots were in the radicalism and religion of the Nonconformist tradition of rural West Wales. Yet he threw himself into the practical struggles of his century - to unionise the industrial and agricultural workers of Wales and to build political parties which could fight for them.

Originally working as a compositor (a setter of type, by hand), his entire working career was spent in and around printing and publishing, in every capacity within the industry, and at all levels. Having pursued many areas of collecting since childhood (when war souvenirs from Nazi Germany were relatively commonplace in post-war Britain), the concept of producing a book about Third Reich edged weapons became a possibility through a first-hand understanding of the printing trade, and how to get a book self-published. It was this opportunity that opened the way for many other future publications.  Selected works  * 1965: A guide to Nazi daggers, swords and bayonets, F. J. Stephens.

Disciplines are defined (in part) and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties within colleges and universities to which their practitioners belong. Academic disciplines are conventionally divided into the humanities, including language, art and cultural studies, and the scientific disciplines, such as physics, chemistry, and biology; the social sciences are sometimes considered a third category. Individuals associated with academic disciplines are commonly referred to as experts or specialists. Others, who may have studied liberal arts or systems theory rather than concentrating in a specific academic discipline, are classified as generalists. While academic disciplines in and of themselves are more or less focused practices, scholarly approaches such as multidisciplinarity/interdisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity, and cross-disciplinarity integrate aspects from multiple academic disciplines, therefore addressing any problems that may arise from narrow concentration within specialized fields of study. For example, professionals may encounter trouble communicating across academic disciplines because of differences in language, specified concepts or methodology. Some researchers believe that academic disciplines may, in the future, be replaced by what is known as Mode 2Gibbons, Michael; Camille Limoges, Helga Nowotny, Simon Schwartzman, Peter Scott, & Martin Trow (1994). The New Production of Knowledge: The Dynamics of Science and Research in Contemporary Societies. London: Sage. or \\"post- academic science\\",Ziman, John (2000). Real Science: What It Is, and What It Means. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. which involves the acquisition of cross-disciplinary knowledge through collaboration of specialists from various academic disciplines. Terminology Also known as a field of study, field of inquiry, research field and branch of knowledge. The different terms are used in different countries and fields. History of the concept The University of Paris in 1231 consisted of four faculties: Theology, Medicine, Canon Law and Arts.History of Education, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (1977, 15th edition), Macropaedia Volume 6, p. 337 Educational institutions originally used the term \\"discipline\\" to catalog and archive the new and expanding body of information produced by the scholarly community. Disciplinary designations originated in German universities during the beginning of the nineteenth century. Most academic disciplines have their roots in the mid-to-late- nineteenth century secularization of universities, when the traditional curricula were supplemented with non-classical languages and literatures, social sciences such as political science, economics, sociology and public administration, and natural science and technology disciplines such as physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. In the early twentieth century, new academic disciplines such as education and psychology were added. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an explosion of new academic disciplines focusing on specific themes, such as media studies, women's studies, and Africana studies. Many academic disciplines designed as preparation for careers and professions, such as nursing, hospitality management, and corrections, also emerged in the universities. Finally, interdisciplinary scientific fields of study such as biochemistry and geophysics gained prominence as their contribution to knowledge became widely recognized. Some new disciplines, such as public administration, can be found in more than one disciplinary setting; some public administration programs are associated with business schools (thus emphasizing the public management aspect), while others are linked to the political science field (emphasizing the policy analysis aspect). As the twentieth century approached, these designations were gradually adopted by other countries and became the accepted conventional subjects. However, these designations differed between various countries. In the twentieth century, the natural science disciplines included: physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and astronomy. The social science disciplines included: economics, politics, sociology, and psychology. Prior to the twentieth century, categories were broad and general, which was expected due to the lack of interest in science at the time. With rare exceptions, practitioners of science tended to be amateurs and were referred to as \\"natural historians\\" and \\"natural philosophers\\"‚Äîlabels that date back to Aristotle‚Äîinstead of \\"scientists\\". Natural history referred to what we now call life sciences and natural philosophy referred to the current physical sciences. Prior to the twentieth century, few opportunities existed for science as an occupation outside the educational system. Higher education provided the institutional structure for scientific investigation, as well as economic support for research and teaching. Soon, the volume of scientific information rapidly increased and researchers realized the importance of concentrating on smaller, narrower fields of scientific activity. Because of this narrowing, scientific specializations emerged. As these specializations developed, modern scientific disciplines in universities also improved their sophistication. Eventually, academia's identified disciplines became the foundations for scholars of specific specialized interests and expertise. Functions and criticism An influential critique of the concept of academic disciplines came from Michel Foucault in his 1975 book, Discipline and Punish. Foucault asserts that academic disciplines originate from the same social movements and mechanisms of control that established the modern prison and penal system in eighteenth- century France, and that this fact reveals essential aspects they continue to have in common: \\"The disciplines characterize, classify, specialize; they distribute along a scale, around a norm, hierarchize individuals in relation to one another and, if necessary, disqualify and invalidate.\\" (Foucault, 1975/1979, p. 223)Foucault, Michel (1977). Discipline and Punish: The birth of the prison. Trans. Alan Sheridan. New York: Vintage. (Translation of: Surveiller et punir; naissance de la prison. [Paris] : Gallimard, 1975). Communities of academic disciplines Communities of academic disciplines can be found outside academia within corporations, government agencies, and independent organizations, where they take the form of associations of professionals with common interests and specific knowledge. Such communities include corporate think tanks, NASA, and IUPAC. Communities such as these exist to benefit the organizations affiliated with them by providing specialized new ideas, research, and findings. Nations at various developmental stages will find need for different academic disciplines during different times of growth. A newly developing nation will likely prioritize government, political matters and engineering over those of the humanities, arts and social sciences. On the other hand, a well-developed nation may be capable of investing more in the arts and social sciences. Communities of academic disciplines would contribute at varying levels of importance during different stages of development. Interactions These categories explain how the different academic disciplines interact with one another. =Multidisciplinary= Multidisciplinary knowledge is associated with more than one existing academic discipline or profession. A multidisciplinary community or project is made up of people from different academic disciplines and professions. These people are engaged in working together as equal stakeholders in addressing a common challenge. A multidisciplinary person is one with degrees from two or more academic disciplines. This one person can take the place of two or more people in a multidisciplinary community. Over time, multidisciplinary work does not typically lead to an increase or a decrease in the number of academic disciplines. One key question is how well the challenge can be decomposed into subparts, and then addressed via the distributed knowledge in the community. The lack of shared vocabulary between people and communication overhead can sometimes be an issue in these communities and projects. If challenges of a particular type need to be repeatedly addressed so that each one can be properly decomposed, a multidisciplinary community can be exceptionally efficient and effective. There are many examples of a particular idea appearing in different academic disciplines, all of which came about around the same time. One example of this scenario is the shift from the approach of focusing on sensory awareness of the whole, \\"an attention to the 'total field, a \\"sense of the whole pattern, of form and function as a unity\\", an \\"integral idea of structure and configuration\\". This has happened in art (in the form of cubism), physics, poetry, communication and educational theory. According to Marshall McLuhan, this paradigm shift was due to the passage from the era of mechanization, which brought sequentiality, to the era of the instant speed of electricity, which brought simultaneity. Multidisciplinary approaches also encourage people to help shape the innovation of the future. The political dimensions of forming new multidisciplinary partnerships to solve the so-called societal Grand Challenges were presented in the Innovation Union and in the European Framework Programme, the Horizon 2020 operational overlay. Innovation across academic disciplines is considered the pivotal foresight of the creation of new products, systems, and processes for the benefit of all societies' growth and wellbeing. Regional examples such as Biopeople and industry-academia initiatives in translational medicine such as SHARE.ku.dk in Denmark provides the evidence of the successful endeavour of multidisciplinary innovation and facilitation of the paradigm shift. =Transdisciplinary= In practice, transdisciplinary can be thought of as the union of all interdisciplinary efforts. While interdisciplinary teams may be creating new knowledge that lies between several existing disciplines, a transdisciplinary team is more holistic and seeks to relate all disciplines into a coherent whole. =Cross- disciplinary= Cross-disciplinary knowledge is that which explains aspects of one discipline in terms of another. Common examples of cross-disciplinary approaches are studies of the physics of music or the politics of literature. Bibliometric studies of disciplines Bibliometrics can be used to map several issues in relation to disciplines, for example the flow of ideas within and among disciplines (Lindholm-Romantschuk, 1998)Lindholm-Romantschuk, Y. (1998). Scholarly book reviewing in the social sciences and humanities. The flow of ideas within and among disciplines. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press. or the existence of specific national traditions within disciplines.Ohlsson, H. (1999). Is there a Scandinavian psychology? A bibliometric note on the publication profiles of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, 40, 235‚Äì39. Scholarly impact and influence of one discipline on another may be understood by analyzing the flow of citations.Serenko, A. & Bontis, N. (2013). The intellectual core and impact of the knowledge management academic discipline. Journal of Knowledge Management, 17(1), 137‚Äì55. The Bibliometrics approach is described as straightforward because it is based on simple counting. The method is also objective but the quantitative method may not be compatible with a qualitative assessment and therefore manipulated. The number of citations is dependent on the number of persons working in the same domain instead of inherent quality or published result's originality.

The mall was a development of the Mondawmin Corporation, a firm set up in 1952 by James Rouse and Hunter Moss under the Moss-Rouse Company. When it first opened in October 1956, it had an open-air plan and was called the Mondawmin Center. It was later enclosed and renamed the Mondawmin Mall. Mondamin was the name of a Native American corn god mentioned in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem \\"The Song of Hiawatha.\\" History Alexander Brown of Mondawmin In 1841, Patrick Macaulay (1795‚Äì1849) constructed a Greek Revival mansion on 73 acres that he named Mondawmin Manor. Macaulay was a Baltimore City councilman, doctor, editor of the Baltimore North American and early director of the B&O; railroad. It is said that poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow suggested to Macaulay that he should name the estate after a Native American god of corn, Mondamin, referenced in the poem \\"The Song of Hiawatha.\\" Upon Macaulay's death, George Brown purchased Mondawmin and it was owned and maintained by the Brown family until 1949. The only remaining feature from the original estate is a marble fountain that can be found in Frederick, Maryland. In 1949, Alexander Brown Griswold approached James Rouse and asked what he could develop on 46 acres of property on the outskirts of Baltimore City. Rouse proposed the idea of a shopping center and the estate was demolished for development in 1955. Mondawmin Center was built as an urban retail hub. It was an open-air complex of 58 store spaces, featuring a spiral staircase, a three- level Sears, a G.C. Murphy 5 and 10, and Food Fair and Penn Fruit supermarkets. Jim Rouse's brother Willard Goldsmith Rouse arranged the initial leasing, which included \\"The White Coffee Pot\\", a store that opened as a segregated establishment. The center was fully enclosed during renovations that started in 1963 and its name was changed to Mondawmin Mall. After the 1968 Baltimore riots produced white flight, the mall revenues declined and Sears left. Vacant space was occupied by the department of social services, where 35 people were held hostage in May 1977 by an unemployed man facing court action. The Rouse Company had sold the Mondawmin Mall property in the mid-1960s, only to buy it back in 1982. They performed a large-scale renovation in 1983, sectioning the vacant Sears into smaller store spaces and adding a parking garage to the west end of the structure. With the acquisition of the Rouse Company by Chicago-based General Growth Properties, in 2004, Mondawmin Mall became a GGP holding. General Growth Properties went through bankruptcy proceedings between April 2009 and May 2010. Once criticized for not meeting the needs of the local population, it is now better serving the community following a $68 million renovation between early 2007 and late 2008. During this project, the parking garage was demolished and replaced with a Target store. Two anchors, A.J. Wright (which later became Marshalls) and Shoppers Food & Pharmacy, were added to the east end of the shopping center. A branch of the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) of Maryland was on the Mondawmin property in a separate building. In 2011, the MVA moved to Hilltop Plaza Shopping Center in northwest Baltimore. During the 2015 Baltimore riots, police protected the Mondawmin Mall for a short period of time, eventually closing in the mid afternoon. Other images of the Mondawmin Mall appeared on major news networks showing looters running into and out of the mall during the riots. The mall remained closed from Monday, 27 April 2015, until Saturday, 2 May 2015, and reopened on Sunday, 3 May 2015. On November 7, 2017, Target announced that its Mondawmin store would close in February 2018. In popular culture Mondawmin Mall was prominently featured in the movie Species II, 1998, starring Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger Transportation Mondawmin station The perimeter of the Mondawmin Mall property is composed of some major Baltimore roads, including Liberty Heights Avenue, Reisterstown Road, and Gwynns Falls Parkway. Also nearby are Maryland Route 129 and Monroe Street. Located on the Mondawmin property is the Mondawmin Transit Center, which mainly includes Mondawmin station of the Baltimore Metro Subway. This station serves as a hub for 10 Maryland Transit Administration bus lines. There are also 175 spaces in the mall's parking lot designated for use by riders of the Metro Subway.Maryland Transit Administration References External links *Mondawmin Mall on Google Street View Category:Mondawmin, Baltimore Category:Shopping malls in Maryland Category:Brookfield Properties Retail Group Category:Buildings and structures in Baltimore Category:Shopping malls established in 1956 Category:1956 establishments in Maryland ","title":"Mondawmin Mall"},{"id":"14924133","text":"The Cvjetkovic CA-61 Mini-Ace is a 1960s American homebuilt monoplane aircraft designed by Anton Cvjetkovic.

The intervention came after the outbreak of the Angolan Civil War, which occurred after the former Portuguese colony was granted independence after the Angolan War of Independence. The civil war quickly became a proxy war between the Eastern Bloc led by the Soviet Union and the Western Bloc led by the United States. South Africa and the United States backed UNITA and the FNLA, while communist nations backed the MPLA.George, p. 1Smith, pp. 66, 71-72 4,000 Cuban troops helped to turn back a three-pronged advance by the SADF and Zairean troops, backed up by foreign mercenaries. Later, 18,000 Cuban troops defeated the FNLA in the north and UNITA in the south. Separatists from the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) fought the Cubans but were defeated. In 1976, the Cuban military in Angola reached 36,000 troops. Following the withdrawal of Zaire and South Africa (March 1976), Cuban forces remained in Angola to support the MPLA government against UNITA in the continuing civil war. South Africa spent the following decade launching bombing and strafing raids from its bases in South West Africa into southern Angola, while UNITA engaged in ambushes, hit-and-run attacks, and harassment of Cuban units. In 1988, Cuban troops (increased to about 55,000) intervened again to avert military disaster in a Soviet-led People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) offensive against UNITA, which was still supported by South Africa, leading to the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale and the opening of a second front. This turn of events is considered to have been the major impetus to the success of the ongoing peace talks leading to the New York Accords, the agreement by which Cuban and South African forces withdrew from Angola while South West Africa gained its independence from South Africa.George, p. 3Film Une Odyss√©e Africaine (France, 2006, 59 min) directed by: Jihan El TahriGleijesesCuito Cuanavale ‚Äì \\"Afrikas Stalingrad\\", Ein Sieg √ºber Pretorias Apartheid\\" in: Neues Deutschland, 19/20 April. 2008Campbell, Horace: The Military Defeat of the South Africans in Angola in: Monthly Review, April 1989 Cuban military engagement in Angola ended in 1991, while the Angolan Civil War continued until 2002. Cuban casualties in Angola totaled approximately 10,000 dead, wounded or missing. Background =Failure of the Alvor Agreement and Civil War= The Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974 in Portugal took the world by surprise and caught the independence movements in its last African colonies unprepared.George, pp. 50‚Äì52 After smooth negotiations, Mozambique's independence was granted on 25 June 1975, but Angolan control remained disputed between the three rival independence movements: MPLA, FNLA and UNITA in Angola-proper and Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) in Cabinda. Until independence, the independence movements' priority lay in fighting the colonial power and they initially had no clear alliances. With the disappearance of Portugal as their common foe, ethnic and ideological rivalries moved to the fore. Fighting between the three already broke out in November 1974, starting in Luanda and quickly spreading across all of Angola. The new leftist Portuguese government showed little interest in interfering but often favored the MPLA. The country soon fell apart into different spheres of influence, the FNLA taking hold of northern Angola and UNITA in the central south. The MPLA mostly held the coastline, the far south-east and, in November 1974 gained control of Cabinda.George, p. 55 The disunity of the three main movements postponed the handing over of power. The Alvor Agreement, which the three and Portugal signed on 15 January, proved to be no solid foundation for the procedure. The transitional government the agreement provided for was equally composed of the three big independence movements and Portugal. It was sworn in on 31 January 1975; independence day was set for 11 November 1975, the same day of the ceasefire.Library of Congress Country StudiesSmith, p. 66 FLEC was not part of the deal because it fought for the independence of Cabinda, which the Portuguese had administratively joined as an exclave to Angola. Fighting in Luanda (referred to as the \\"Second War of Liberation\\" by the MPLA) resumed hardly a day after the transitional government took office.George, p. 59 FNLA troops, flown in from Zaire, had been taking positions in Luanda since October 1974. The MPLA had followed later in smaller numbers.Gleijeses, p. 250 To that point, the MPLA and UNITA \\"had given every sign of intending to honour the Alvor agreement\\".Smith, p. 68 Fighting broke out in Luanda between the FNLA and the MPLA. The FNLA were backed by Mobutu and the US. By March, the FNLA from northern Angola was driving on Luanda joined by units of the Zairian army which the U.S. had encouraged Mobutu to provide.Norton, W.: In Search of Enemies: A CIA Story, New York, 1978, quoted in: Smith, p. 67 On 28 April, the FNLA unleashed a second wave of attacks and in early May, 200 Zairian troops crossed into northern Angola in its support.Wright, George in: The Destruction of a Nation: United States' Policy toward Angola since 1945, Pluto Press, London, Chicago, 1997, , p. 60George, p. 63 The initially weaker MPLA retreated south but with supplies finally arriving from the Soviet Union then succeeded in driving the FNLA out of Luanda by 9 July. The FNLA took up positions east of Kifangondo at the eastern outskirts of the capital, from where it kept up its pressure, and eliminated all remaining MPLA presence in the northern provinces of Uige and Zaire.Smith, pp. 68, 70 The fighting was taken up throughout the whole country. The independence movements attempted to seize key strategic points, most importantly the capital on the day of independence. In a meeting of the United States National Security Council (NSC) on 27 June 1975, U.S. President Gerald Ford said that, in spite of planned elections, it was important to get \\"his man\\" in first, referring to then UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi being in control of Luanda before the elections. Arthur Schlesinger pointed out at the same meeting that the U.S. \\"might wish to encourage the disintegration of Angola. Cabinda in the clutches of Mobutu would mean far greater security of the petroleum resources.\\"Document obtained from Gerald Ford Library, NSC Meetings File, Box 2. Several sections are inked out including the one revealing the person President Ford quoted. =Foreign involvement= Starting in the early 1960s, the three big independence movements enjoyed support from a wide range of countries, in some cases even from the same. By the time of independence, FNLA and UNITA received aid from the U.S., Zaire, South Africa and China. As long as Portugal was present in Angola, the movements had to have their headquarters in independent neighbouring countries, making Congo-L√©opoldville (Zaire/Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly Belgian), for both MPLA and FNLA a logical choice. After its expulsion from L√©opoldville (now Kinshasa) in November 1963, the MPLA moved across the Congo River to formerly French Congo- Brazzaville (Republic of Congo), where it was invited by its new leftist government.George, p. 10 The FNLA stayed in Congo-L√©opoldville to which it remained closely tied and from where it received the bulk of its support. FNLA leader Holden Roberto was linked to Mobutu by marriage and obligated to him for many past favours. Over the years the FNLA had become little more than an extension of Mobutu's own armed forces. Much of Zaire's support came indirectly from the U.S., with which Zaire's leader Mobutu had close ties. Zaire was the first country to send troops to Angola in March 1975 and to engage in fighting against the MPLA by the summer of that year.IPRI‚ÄîInstituto Portugu√™s de Rela√ß√µes Internacionais : The United States and the Portuguese Decolonization (1974-1976) Kenneth Maxwell, Council on Foreign Relations. Paper presented at the International Conference \\"Portugal, Europe and the United States\\", Lisbon, October 2003 In the summer of 1974, China was first to act after the Portuguese Revolution and posted 200 military instructors to Zaire where they trained FNLA troops and supplied military assistance. Chinese involvement was a measure against Soviet influence rather than that from western countries. On 27 October 1975, they were also the first to withdraw their military instructors. UNITA, which split away from FNLA in 1965/66 was initially Maoist and received some support from China.Library of Congress Country Studies China had been training Mobutu's elite division, the Kamanyola, also trained the FNLA but withdrew their support for Zaire and the FNLA by the end of December 1975.Klinghoffer, A. J. in: The Angolan War: A Study in Soviet Policy in the Third World, Boulder, 1980 In 1975 China were also the first to pull out of the area after the Portuguese Revolution. When their support ceased FNLA and UNITA became firmly established in the western camp. The United States had a history of supporting the Salazar regime in Portugal, e.g. allowing NATO equipment to be used in Angola, as well as independence movements fighting against Portuguese colonialism.George, p. 14 U.S. support for the FNLA was taken up by the Kennedy administration in 1960. Holden Roberto had been on the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) payroll since 1963.Smith, p. 70 On 7 July 1974, the CIA started funding the FNLA on a small scale.George, p. 54 On 22 January 1975, one week after the Alvor Accords were signed and just before the provisional government of Angola was to take office, the U.S. National Security Council's \\"40 Committee\\", which oversaw clandestine CIA operations, authorized US$300,000 in covert aid to the FNLA.Library of Congress Country Studies As the CIA was suspicious of the left-leaning MPLA it \\"had no wish to see the US government deal with the MPLA\\" and it did not want them to be part of the transitional government.Smith, p. 69 The US increased its support for the FNLA and for the first time took up funding of UNITA. On 18 July 1975 U.S. president Ford approved covert CIA operation \\"IAFEATURE\\" to aid FNLA and UNITA with money (US$30 million), arms and instructors. U.S. military instructors (CIA) arrived in southern Angola in early August where they closely cooperated with their South African counterparts who arrived around the same time. The support involved the recruitment of mercenaries and an expanded propaganda campaign against the MPLA. The American public was not informed. The U.S. \\"was publicly committed to an embargo against the delivery of arms to Angolan factions while it was secretly launching a paramilitary programme\\". South Africa, which was then under a white-minority rule known as apartheid, soon came to be the closest allies of both UNITA and FNLA. Israel supported the FNLA from 1963 to 1969 and the FNLA sent members to Israel for training. Through the 1970s Israel shipped arms to the FNLA via Zaire. Some East Bloc countries and Yugoslavia first established ties with the MPLA in the early 1960s during its struggle against the Portuguese. The Soviet Union started modest military aid in the late 1960s. This support remained clandestine, came in trickles and sometimes ceased altogether. This was the case in 1972, when the MPLA came under strong pressure from the Portuguese and was torn apart by internal strife (struggle between MPLA leader Ant√≥nio Agostinho Neto and Chipenda from 1972 to 1974). Soviet aid was suspended in 1973 with the exception of a few limited shipments in 1974 to counter Chinese support for the FNLA; only Yugoslavia continued to send supplies to the MPLA.George, pp. 11-12 In response to U.S. and Chinese support for the FNLA, Soviet support for the MPLA was resumed in March 1975 in the form of arms deliveries by air via Brazzaville and by sea via Dar-es- Salaam. Soviet assistance to the MPLA was always somewhat reluctant; they never fully trusted Neto and their relationship was to remain ambivalent through the following years. The Soviets preferred a political solution, but they did not want to see the MPLA marginalized.Wright, George in: The Destruction of a Nation: United States' Policy toward Angola since 1945, Pluto Press, London, Chicago, 1997, , p. 58 Even after the South African incursions the Soviets only sent arms, but no instructors for the use of the sophisticated weapons.Document from the Centro de Informacion de la Defensa de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias, CIDFAR, [Center of Information of the Armed Forces] Among the other Eastern Bloc countries the MPLA had well established contacts with East Germany and Romania, the former shipping large amounts of non-military supplies. Although being leftist, Neto was interested in an ideological balance in his foreign support, but in spite of \\"overtures\\" well into 1975, he was unable to procure support for the MPLA from the U.S., thus becoming solely dependent on the eastern camp.Smith, pp. 62,69 Cuba and the MPLA before the Civil War Cuba's first informal contacts with the MPLA dated back to the late 1950s. MPLA guerrillas received their first training from Cubans in Algiers starting in 1963 and Che Guevara met MPLA- leader Agostinho Neto for the first high-level talks on 5 January 1965 in Brazzaville where Cuba was establishing a two-year military mission. This mission had the primary purpose to act as a strategic reserve for the Cuban operation in eastern Congo. It also was to provide assistance to the Alphonse Massemba-D√©bat government in Brazzaville and, at Neto's request, to the MPLA with its operations against the Portuguese in Cabinda and in northern Angola where its major foe was the FNLA. This co-operation marked the beginning of the Cuban-MPLA alliance which was to last 26 years.George, pp. 22-23, 30 The MPLA-Cuban operations in Cabinda and northern Angola were met with very little success and the Cubans ended the mission to Brazzaville as planned in July 1966. The MPLA moved its headquarters to Lusaka in early 1968. A few MPLA guerrillas continued to receive military training in Cuba but else contacts between Cuba and the MPLA cooled as Havana turned its attention to the independence struggle in Guinea-Bissau.Mabeko, Tali in: Dissidences, p. 348George, p. 44 Following Castro's tour of African countries in May 1972 Cuba stepped up its internationalist operations in Africa starting a training mission in Sierra Leone and smaller technical missions in Equatorial Guinea, Somalia, Algeria and Tanzania. In a memorandum of 22 November 1972, the Cuban Major Manuel Pi√±eiro Lozada communicated to Ra√∫l Castro the MPLA's request for small amounts of training and crew.Document from the Centro de Informacion de la Defensa de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias, CIDFAR, [Information Centre of the Revolutionary Armed Forces] These considerations in 1972 bore no fruit and Cuba's attentions remained focused on Guinea-Bissau. It was only after the Portuguese Revolution that an MPLA delegation brought a request for economic aid, military training and arms to Cuba on 26 July 1974. In early October Cuba received another request, this time more urgent, for five Cuban military officers to help organize the MPLA army, FAPLA. In December 1974 / January 1975 Cuba sent Major Alfonso Perez Morales and Carlos Cadelo on a fact finding mission to Angola to assess the situation.Gleijeses, pp. 244-245 (Quotations from interview with Cadelo and from Cienfuegos to Senen Casas, Havana, 22 November 1974) In a letter of 26 January 1975, handed to Cadelo and Morales, Neto listed what the MPLA wanted from Cuba, including \\"The establishment, organization, and maintenance of a military school for cadres\\", \\"A [Cuban] ship to transport the war materiel that we have in Dar-es-Salaam to Angola\\", \\"Uniforms and military equipment for 10,000 men\\", and \\"Financial assistance while we are establishing and organizing ourselves.\\" Gleijeses quoting: (Agostinho Neto: Necesidades urgentes. Lista dirigada al Comite Central del Partido Communista de Cuba, 26 January 1975, enclosed in \\"Visita\\", pp. 22-23) Although Cuba was considering the establishment of a military mission (military training) in Angola, again there was no official response to this request. It was only reiterated by the MPLA in May 1975 when Cuban commander Flavio Bravo met Neto in Brazzaville while the Portuguese were preparing to withdraw from their African colonies.Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Gabriel in: Operation Carlota, http://www.rhodesia.nl/marquez.htm The MPLA's hopes for aid were turned to the eastern Bloc countries from where not enough help materialised according to their wishes. Neto is quoted in a Cuban report complaining about Moscow's lacklustre support. He also expressed hope that the war in Angola would become \\"a vital issue in the fight against imperialism and socialism\\". But neither the USSR nor the MPLA itself expected a major war to break out before independence.Westad, Odd Arne in: \\"Moscow and the Angolan Crisis, 1974-1976: A New Pattern of Intervention\\", Cold War International History Project Bulletin, nos. 8-9, p. 24 In March 1975 the MPLA sent ca. 100 members for training in the Soviet Union and the requested financial assistance (100,000US$) it received from Yugoslavia. =South Africa intervenes= Portugal's sudden retreat from Angola and Mozambique in 1975 ended a history of South African military and intelligence cooperation with Portugal against the Angolan and Namibian independence movements dating back to the 1960s, later formalized in a secret alliance codenamed Alcora Exercise.Library of Congress Country Studies It also ended economic cooperation with regard to the Cunene hydro-project at the Angolan-Namibian border, which South Africa had financed.George, p. 11 South African involvement in Angola, subsumed under what it called the South African Border War, started in 1966 when the conflict with the Namibian independence movement, South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which at that time had its bases in Ovamboland and Zambia, first flared up. With the loss of the Portuguese as an ally and the establishment of pro-SWAPO communist rule in the two former colonies, the apartheid regime lost highly valued sections of its \\"cordon sanitaire\\" (buffer zone) between itself and hostile black Africa.St√ºhrenberg, Michael in: Die Zeit 17/1988, Die Schlacht am Ende der Welt, p. 11Gleijeses, pp. 273-276Dr. Leopold Scholtz: The Namibian Border War (Stellenbosch University) In the following years South Africa engaged in numerous military and economic activities in the region, backing RENAMO in the Mozambican Civil War, undertaking various measures at economic destabilization against Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, backing an unsuccessful mercenary intervention in the Seychelles in 1981, and supporting a coup in Lesotho in 1986. It was behind a coup attempt in Tanzania in 1983, provided support for rebels in Zimbabwe since independence, carried out raids against African National Congress offices in Maputo, Harare and Gaborone and conducted a counterinsurgency war in Namibia against SWAPO. SWAPO retreated to and operated from bases in Angola, and South Africa was confronted not only with the issue of having to cross another border in pursuit of SWAPO but also of another leftist government in the region. Unlike the other countries in the region, South Africa had no economic leverage on Angola, thus making military action the only possible means to exert any influence on the course of events. On 14 July 1975, South African Prime Minister John Vorster approved weapons worth US$14 million to be bought secretly for FNLA and UNITA.Gleijeses quoting: Spies, F. J. du Toit in: Operasie Savannah. Angola 1975-1976, Pretoria, pp. 64-65Gleijeses quoting: Deon Geldenhuys in: The Diplomacy of Isolation: South African Foreign Policy Making, p. 80 First arms shipments for FNLA and UNITA from South Africa arrived in August 1975. On 9 August 1975, a 30-man patrol of the South African Defence Force (SADF) moved some 50 km into southern Angola and occupied the Ruacana-Calueque hydro-electric complex and other installations on the Cunene River. Several hostile incidences with UNITA and SWAPO frightening foreign worker had been the pretext. The defence of the Calueque dam complex in southern Angola was South Africa's justification for the first permanent deployment of regular SADF units inside Angola.Smith, p. 71 On 22 August 1975, the SADF launched operation \\"Sausage II\\", a major raid against SWAPO in southern Angola. In addition, on 4 September 1975, Vorster authorized the provision of limited military training, advice and logistical support. In turn FNLA and UNITA would help the South Africans fighting SWAPO.George, p. 68 Due to the recent MPLA's successes, UNITA's territory had been shrinking to parts of central Angola,Gleijeses quoting: Bureau of Intelligence and Research, DOS, in: Angola: The MPLA Prepares for Independence, 22 September 1975, p 4-5, National Security Archive, Washington, quoting: Le Monde, 13 September 1975, p. 3 and quoting: Diaz Arguelles to Colom√©, 1 October 1975, p. 11 and it became clear to South Africa that independence day would find the MPLA in control of Luanda; \\"neither the United States nor South Africa were willing to accept that.\\" Smith, p. 72 The SADF set up a training camp near Silva Porto and prepared the defences of Nova Lisboa (Huambo). They assembled the mobile attack unit \\"Foxbat\\" to stop approaching FAPLA-units with which it clashed on 5 October, thus saving Nova Lisboa for UNITA.George, p. 69 On 14 October, the South Africans secretly launched Operation Savannah when Task Force Zulu, the first of several South African columns, crossed from Namibia into Cuando Cubango. Southern Angola was in chaos with the three independence movements fighting each other for dominance. It took FAPLA some time, before it noticed who else it was up against and the SADF advanced very quickly. Task force Foxbat joined the intervention in mid-October.Smith, p. 62Gleijeses, p. 298 The operation provided for elimination of the MPLA from the southern border area, then from south western Angola, from the central region, and finally for the capture of Luanda.Gleijeses quoting: Deon Geldenhuys in: The Diplomacy of Isolation: South African Foreign Policy Making, p. 80, quoting: du Preez, Sophia in: Avontuur in Angola. Die verhaal van Suid-Afrika se soldate in Angola 1975-1976, Pretoria, pp. 32, 63, 86 and quoting: Spies, F. J. du Toit in: Operasie Savannah. Angola 1975-1976, Pretoria, pp. 93-101 \\"Pretoria believed that by invading Angola it could install its proxies and shore up apartheid for the foreseeable future\\" . The United States encouraged the South Africans, had known of their covert plans in advance and co-operated militarily with its forces, contrary to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's testimony to Congress at the time, as well as at odds with the version in his memoirs and in contrast to what President Ford told the Chinese, who supported the FNLA but were worried about South African engagement in Angola.George, p. 71 According to John Stockwell, a former CIA officer, \\"there was close liaison between the CIA and the South Africans\\" and \\"'high officials' in Pretoria claimed that their intervention in Angola had been based on an 'understanding' with the United States\\".Marcum, John in: Lessons of Angola, Foreign Affairs 54, No. 3 (April 1976), quoted in: Smith, p. 62 =Cuban military mission= Until late August, Cuba only had a few technical advisors in Angola, which the CIA took note of.CIA, National Intelligence Daily, 11 October 1975, p. 4, NSA On 3 August, a Cuban delegation traveled a second time to Angola to assess the situation, to draw up plans for the training programme as requested by Neto, and to hand over US$100,000.George, p. 66 Neto had complained \\"of the little amount of aid from socialist countries and \\"that the USSR detained aid to the MPLA in 1972, even though they told us that they are now helping with arms, but it's very little compared with their vast needs\\". Arguelles agreed with Neto as he saw the sides in Angola \\"clearly defined, that the FNLA and UNITA represented the international imperialist forces and the Portuguese reaction, and the MPLA represented the progressive and nationalist forces.\\"Document from the Centro de Informacion de la Defensa de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias, CIDFAR, [Information Centre of the Revolutionary Armed Forces] After the return of the delegation on 8 August, the Cubans considered the options of their instructors in Angola in case of an intervention by South Africa or Zaire which would be either \\"guerrilla war\\" or withdrawal to Zambia, where Cuba proceeded to open an embassy.Gleijeses, p. 255 In a memorandum of 11 August 1975, Major Ra√∫l Diaz Arg√ºelles to Major Ra√∫l Castro explained the reasons for the visit and briefed on the contents of the talks. He underlined that the attacks on the part of the FNLA and of Mobutu to the MPLA and the possible development of future actions until independence in the month of November was taken into account and the awareness that \\"the reactionaries and the imperialists would try all possible methods to avoid having the forces of the MPLA take power\\". The same day Arg√ºelles proposed a 94-man mission to Castro.George, p. 64 On 15 August, Castro urged the USSR to increase support for the MPLA, offered to send special troops and asked for assistance. The Russians declined.Gleijeses quoting: Westad, Odd Arne in: Moscow and the Angolan Crisis 1974-76: A New Pattern of Intervention, Cold War International Project Bulletin, n.8-9, p. 25 In view of the Zairian intervention in the north and the South African occupation of Ruacana-Calueque hydro-electric complex in the south, it was decided to staff the CIRs with almost 500 Cubans instead of the requested 100, which were to form about 4,800 FAPLA recruits into 16 infantry battalions, 25 mortar batteries and various anti-aircraft units in three to six months. These 500 men included 17 in a medical brigade and 284 officers.Gleijeses quoting: Ministerio de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias: Composicion de fuerzas y medios de la unidad incluyendo el incremento del Punto 4 \\"The decision to expand the operation reflected a feeling in Havana that ‚Ä¶ there had to be enough of them to fulfil their mission as well as defend themselves in the event the operation went awry. It was nevertheless clear that ‚Ä¶they expected it (the mission) to be short term and to last around 6 months\\".George, p. 65 The dispatch of the Cuban volunteers started 21 August and an advance party with the most urgently needed specialists used international commercial flights. Small groups continued to trickle into Luanda on such flights as well as on Cuba's aging Britannia planes and the bulk arrived after a two-week trip aboard three Cuban cargo vessels; the first one, the \\"Vietnam Heroico\\" docked at Porto Amboim on 5 October. The arrival of two Cuban ships in Angola with instructors on board was reported by the CIACIA, National Intelligence Daily, 11 October 1975, p. 4 and raised no alarm in Washington.Gleijeses, p. 228 The CIRs were placed in Cabinda, Benguela, Saurimo (formerly Henrique de Carvalho) and at N'Dalatando (formerly Salazar). The CIR in Cabinda accounted for almost half of the total, 191 men, while the others had 66 or 67 each. Some were posted in headquarters in Luanda or in other places throughout the country. The reason for the stronger detachment in Cabinda was the perceived threat from Zaire either to Cabinda or to the Congo.Gleijeses, pp. 255-256, 265 By the time the training centres were fully staffed and operational on 18‚Äì20 October, unnoticed by the world, Operation Savannah was already in full swing.George, p. 67 Maximum UNITA and SADF advance in southern Angola In contrast to the successes in the south, where by mid October the MPLA had gained control of 12 of Angola's provinces and most urban centres, they only barely managed to keep the well equipped FNLA and its allies abreast on the northern front just east of Luanda.Washington Post, 24 August 1975, B1 The FNLA was receiving arms and equipment from the U.S. via Zaire starting in the end of July Gleijeses, p. 258 and quoting: Rand Daily Mail, 3 August 1975, p. 5 and had been strengthened in September by the arrival of the Fourth and Seventh Zairian Commando Battalions. From July to November the front moved back and forth between Caxito and Quifangondo (Kifangondo). Neto asked the Soviet Union for more support which had no intention to send any staff before independence and only reluctantly sent more arms. The Cubans were busy dealing with the arrival of the contingents for the CIRs and it was only on 19 October that they paid sufficient attention to Luanda's precarious position. Realizing the threat they shut down the CIR at Salazar only 3 days after it started operating and deployed most of the recruits and Cuban instructors in Luanda.George, p. 73-74 Forty instructors from the CIR Salazar were the first Cubans to become involved in the defence of Quifangondo on 23 October 1975 when they launched an unsuccessful assault one FNLA-Zairian forces at Morro do Cal. A second group supported the MPLA on 28 October along the same defence line to the east of Kifangondo.Gleijeses, p. 269 Yet unnoticed by the Cubans, the territory the MPLA had just gained in the south was quickly lost to the South African advances. After South African advisors and antitank weapons had helped to stop an MPLA advance on Nova Lisboa (Huambo) in early October, Zulu took Ro√ßadas by 20 October, S√° da Bandeira by 24 October and Mo√ß√¢medes by 28 October. On 2‚Äì3 November, Cuban instructors for the third time got involved in the fighting, this time 51 men from the CIR Benguela, when they unsuccessfully tried to help the FAPLA stop the Zulu advance near Catengue. This first encounter between Cubans and South Africans also led to the first officially recognized Cuban fatalities. \\"Their participation led Zulu-Commander Breytenbach to conclude that his troops were 'facing the best organized and heaviest FAPLA opposition to date'\\".George, p. 76 Cuba's first intervention =Operation Carlota= It was only after the MPLA debacle at Catengue that the Cubans became fully aware of the South African intervention, that Luanda would be taken and that their training missions were in grave danger unless they took immediate action. Neto had requested immediate and massive reinforcements from Havana at the urging of Arg√ºelles. On 4 November Castro decided to launch an intervention on an unprecedented scale, codenaming the mission Operation Carlota, after 'Black Carlota', the leader of a slave rebellion in 1843. The same day, a first plane with 100 heavy weapon specialists, which the MPLA had requested in September, left for Brazzaville, arriving in Luanda on 7 November. On 9 November the first two Cuban planes arrived in Luanda with the first 100 men of a contingent of a 652-strong battalion of elite Special Forces.George, pp. 77-78 The first priority of the Cubans was helping the MPLA to keep hold of Luanda. Fidel Castro explained the Cuban intervention: \\"When the invasion of Angola by regular South African troops started 23 October, we could not sit idle. And when the MPLA asked us for help, we offered the necessary aid to prevent Apartheid from making itself comfortable in Angola\\". A Bristol Britannia, photographed in 1964. With Operation Carlota, Cuba became a major player in the conflict. Unlike its foreign engagements in the sixties this was no secret operation. Castro decided to support Angola in all openness, sending special forces and 35,000 infantry by the end of 1976, deploying them at Cuba's own expense and with its own means from November 1975 to January 1976. As on its previous missions all personnel were volunteers and the call-up was extremely popular. Air transportation for quick deployments proved to be a major problem. Cuba only had three ageing medium-range Bristol Britannia turboprop planes not fit to make 9,000 km non-stop transatlantic crossings. Nevertheless, between 7 November and 9 December the Cubans managed to run 70 reinforcement flights to Luanda. Initially they were able to make stops in Barbados, the Azores, or Newfoundland, prompting pressure from Washington to deny Cuba landing rights. But moving take-offs to Cuba's easternmost airport, Holguin, taking as little weight as necessary, and adding additional tanks, the planes were used for numerous runs across the ocean until the Soviets pitched in with long-distance jet planes.Gleijeses quoting: Ministerio de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias: Batallon de Tropas Especiales, n. d. For the bulk of the troops and the equipment the Cubans commandeered all available ships in its merchant marine, the first three sailing from Havana on 8 November. They docked in Luanda on 27 and 29 November and 1 December bringing 1,253 troops and equipment.George, pp. 80-81, 99 The deployment of troops was not pre-arranged with the USSR, as often reported and depicted by the US-administration. On the contrary, it also took the USSR by surprise.N. Broutens, Soviet Politb√ºro, dept. chief foreign affairs, in Une Odyss√©e Africaine (France, 2006, 59min) directed by: Jihan El Tahri The Soviets were forced to accept the Cuban troop deployment so as not to endanger relations with their most important ally in close proximity to the United States. But they had in mind to keep a lid on the extent of the Cuban engagement and merely sent arms and a few specialists to Brazzaville and Dar- es-Salaam. It was only two months later after the fighting swung in favour of the Cubans and the U.S. passed the Clark Amendment that Moscow agreed to a degree of support by arranging for a maximum of 10 transport flights from Cuba to Angola.George, pp. 79-80 With the FNLA attacking from the east the situation for the MPLA only a few days before independence looked dim. In addition to this, Cabinda was under threat of takeover by a FLEC-Zairian force. The Cuban troops able to intervene before the declaration of independence on 11 November were basically the ones posted in the three CIRs, the 100 specialists that arrived in Luanda on 7 November and the first 164 special forces of Operation Carlota arriving on two planes on the evening of 8 November.George, p. 82 The 100 specialists and 88 men of the special forces were immediately dispatched to the nearby front at Quifangondo where the FNLA- Zairian force had launched an assault that very morning. They supported 850 FAPLA, 200 Katangans and one Soviet advisor. First heavy weapons had already arrived from Cuba by ship on 7 November, among them cannons, mortars and 6 BM-21 (Katyusha) multiple rocket launchers. The Cubans received reports that the expected invasion of Cabinda had started on the morning of 8 November. =Northern front and Cabinda= The invasion of Cabinda was conducted by three FLEC and one Zairian infantry battalions under the command of 150 French and American mercenaries. The MPLA's had the 232 Cubans of the CIR, a freshly trained and an untrained FAPLA infantry battalion at its disposal. In the ensuing battle for Cabinda from 8‚Äì13 November they managed to repel the invasion without support from Operation Carlota, thus saving the exclave for the MPLA.George, pp. 82-86 Two days before independence the most imminent danger for the MPLA came from the northern front where the FNLA and its allies stood east of Quifangondo. 2,000 FNLA troops were supported by two battalions of Zairian infantry troops (1,200 men), 120 Portuguese mercenaries, a few resident advisors, among them a small CIA contingent, and 52 South Africans led by General Ben de Wet Roos. They were manning the artillery provided by the SADF which had been flown into Ambriz only two days before.George, p. 89 After artillery bombardment on Luanda and Quifangondo through the night and a bombing raid by the South African air force in the early hours the final attack of the FNLA was launched on the morning of 10 November. The attacking force was ambushed and destroyed by the FAPLA-Cuban forces. Cuban forces also bombarded their South African and FNLA enemies with BM-21 Grad rocket launchers which had been put into place only the night before, and were well out of range of the antiquated South African guns. The defeat of the FNLA in the Battle of Quifangondo secured the capital for the MPLA. On the same day the Portuguese handed over power \\"to the people of Angola\\" and shortly after midnight Neto proclaimed independence and the formation of the \\"People's Republic of Angola\\".George, p. 91Gleijeses, pp. 310-311 Urged by the CIA and other clandestine foreign services, the FNLA and UNITA announced the proclamation of a Democratic People's Republic with the temporary capital at Huambo. Yet, UNITA and FNLA could not agree on a united government and fighting between them already broke out in Huambo on the eve of independence day.Quotations from Bridgeland in: Savimbi, p. 151Gleijeses quoting: Rand Daily Mail, 10 November 1975, p. 3Jornal Novo, 12 November 1975, p. 15 On the day of independence the MPLA held little more than the capital and a strip of central Angola inland toward Zaire and the exclave of Cabinda. On 4 December the FAPLA-Cubans launched a counter-offensive against the FNLA. But with Luanda and Cabinda secured and the defeat of the FNLA at Quifangondo they could finally turn more attention to the south.George, p. 101 Cuba operated independently through December and January bringing in their troops in slowly, but steadily. Two months after the start of Operation Carlota the Soviets agreed to ten charter flights on long-range IL-62 jet airliners, starting on 8 January.Document from the Centro de Informacion de la Defensa de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias, CIDFAR, [Center of Information of the Armed Forces]) This was followed one week later by an agreement that \\"the Soviets would supply all future weaponry ‚Ä¶ transporting it directly to Angola so that the Cuban airlift could concentrate on personnel.\\" By early February, with increasing numbers in Cuban troops and sophisticated weaponry, the tide changed in favour of the MPLA. The final offensive in the North started on 1 January 1976. By 3 January FAPLA-Cuban forces took the FNLA air bases of Negage and Camabatela and a day later the FNLA capital of Carmona. A last- ditch attempt by FNLA to use foreign mercenaries enlisted by the CIA (see next chapter: U.S. response) failed; on 11 January FAPLA-Cubans captured Ambriz and Ambrizete (N'zeto) an on 15 February the FNLA's last foothold, S√£o Salvador. By late February one Cuban and 12 FAPLA and battalions had completely annihilated the FNLA, driving what was left of them and the Zairian army across the border.Gleijeses quoting: Vermerk √ºber das Gespr√§ch m. d.

The news from the southern front was, in their view, still positive.CIA, Intelligence Checklist, 14 November 1975, pp. A2-A5, NSA Kissinger, like the South Africans, was shaken by the scale of the Soviet and Cuban response. The CIA's Angolan task force at CIA headquarters at Langley had been so confident of success by the Zairian and South African regulars, that on 11 November the members had celebrated Angolan independence with wine and cheese in their offices. The U.S. had not commented on the South African intervention in Angola but denounced the Cuban intervention when it first acknowledged Cuban troops in Angola in an official statement on 24 November 1975. Kissinger said \\"that US efforts at rapprochement with Cuba would end should 'Cuban armed intervention in the affairs of other nations struggling to decide their own fate' continue.\\" On 28 February 1976, Ford called Castro \\"an international outlaw\\" and the Cuban intervention a \\"flagrant act of aggression\\".Smith, p. 73 Due to the hostility between the U.S. and Cuba, the Americans regarded such an air by the Cubans as a defeat which could not be accepted.Cohen, Hermann, National Security Council, USA, in Une Odyss√©e Africaine (France, 2006, 59m) directed by: Jihan El Tahri The U.S. assumed that the USSR was behind the Cuban interference.Gr√§fin D√∂nhoff, Marion in: Die Buren sind abgezogen, Pretorias Chance zum Umdenken, Die Zeit 36, 1988, p. 7 On 9 December Ford asked the Soviets to suspend the airlift, still assuming it was a Soviet-run operation.George, p. 99 The Americans also depicted the motivations and timings of the Cubans differently: They claimed that South Africa had to intervene after Cuba sent troops in support of the MPLA and that the war in Angola was a major new challenge to US power by an expansionist Moscow newly confident following communist victories in the Vietnam War. Only years later did it become clear to them that the Cubans acted on their own behalf.Frank Wisner Jr., Ambassador, US-Foreign Ministry, in Une Odyss√©e Africaine (France, 2006, 59m) directed by: Jihan El Tahri Castro responded to the U.S. reaction: \\"Why were they vexed? Why had they planned everything to take possession of Angola before 11 November? Angola is a country rich in resources. In Cabinda there is lots of oil. Some imperialists wonder why we help the Angolans, which interests we have. They are used to thinking that one country helps another one only when it wants its oil, copper, diamonds or other resources. No, we are not after material interests and it is logical that this is not understood by the imperialist. They only know chauvinistic, nationalistic and selfish criteria. By helping the people of Angola we are fulfilling a fundamental duty of Internationalism. On 3 December 1975, in a meeting with officials from the U.S. and China including Deng Xiaoping (Vice Premier and deputy of Mao Zedong), Chiao Kuan-hua (Foreign Minister), President Gerald Ford, Henry Kissinger (Secretary of State/Foreign Minister), Brent Scowcroft (Assistant to the President for NSA) and George H. W. Bush (Chief of U.S. Liaison Office in Peking) international issues were discussed, one of them being Angola. Although China had supported the MPLA in the past, they now sided with the FNLA and UNITA. China was especially concerned about African sensitivities and pride and considered South African involvement as the primary and relative complex problem. Kissinger responded, that the U.S. is prepared to \\"push out South Africa as soon as an alternative military force can be created\\". Document obtained by National Security Archive, from National Archives Record Group 59. Records of the Department of State, Policy Planning Staff, Director's Files (Winston Lord) It is in this meeting that President Ford told the Chinese: \\"We had nothing to do with the South African involvement, and we will take action to get South Africa out, provided a balance can be maintained for their not being in\\". He also said that he had approved US$35 million more (in support of the north) above what had been done before. They discussed and agreed who should support the FNLA or UNITA by which means and in what manner taking into account the sensitivities of the neighbouring countries. It was only when the U.S. administration asked Congress for US$28 million for IAFEATURE that Congress really paid attention to the events in Angola. By then \\"the evidence of the South African invasion was overwhelming and the stench of US-collusion with Pretoria hung in the air. Worse, the growing numbers of Cuban troops had derailed the CIA's plans and the administration seemed at a loss what to do next.\\"Gleijeses, p. 332 The money was not approved and on 20 December 1975, the U.S. Senate passed an amendment banning covert assistance to anti-Communist forces and curtailing CIA involvement in Angola. Later that winter, an amendment to the foreign aid bill sponsored by Dick Clark extended the ban. (Clark Amendment) The U.S. administration resorted to other means of support for FNLA and UNITA of which one was raising mercenaries. The CIA initiated a covert programme to recruit Brazilians and Europeans to fight in the north of Angola. Altogether they managed to enlist around 250 men, but by the time meaningful numbers arrived in January 1975 the campaign in the north was all but over.Gleijeses, pp. 334-337 Other ways of continued support for the FNLA and UNITA were through South Africa and other U.S. allied states such as Israel and Morocco.Wright, George in: The Destruction of a Nation: United States' Policy toward Angola since 1945, Pluto Press, London, Chicago, 1997, , p. 100 A report by Henry Kissinger of 13 January 1976 gives an insight into the activities and hostilities in Angola, inter alia: \\"US intelligence estimated that by December 20 there were 5,000 to 6,000 Cubans in Angola.\\"Gleijeses quoting: Secretary of State to All American Republic Diplomatic Posts, 20 December 1975 \\"Cuban sources, however, indicate that the number hovered around 3,500 to 4,000.\\"Gleijeses quoting: \\"Informe\\", p. 11 This more or less would have put the Cubans at par with the South Africans on the southern front. Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez wrote that Kissinger remarked to Venezuelan President Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez: 'Our intelligence services have grown so bad that we only found out that Cubans were being sent to Angola after they were already there.' At that moment, there were many Cuban troops, military specialists and civilian technicians in Angola ‚Äî more even than Kissinger imagined. Indeed, there were so many ships anchored in the bay of Luanda that by February 1976 Neto said to a functionary close to him: 'It's not right', if they go on like that, the Cubans will ruin themselves.' It is unlikely that even the Cubans had foreseen that their intervention would reach such proportions. It had been clear to them right from the start, however, that the action had to be swift, decisive, and at all costs successful.M√°rquez, Gabriel Garc√≠a in: Operation Carlota, New Left Review I/101-102, January‚ÄìApril 1977 But one result of the events in Angola in 1976 was the American's heightened attention to African affairs, especially in the south of the continent. Kissinger worried, \\"if the Cubans are involved there, Namibia is next and after that South Africa itself.\\" With the need to distance themselves from outcasts in the eyes of black Africa this also meant the U.S. would drop support for the white regime in Rhodesia, a price it was willing to pay to \\"thwart communism\\".Gleijeses quoting: Quotations from Kissinger, NSC meeting, 7 April 1976, p. 13, NSAd, NSC Meeting Minutes, box 2, GRFLNewsweek, 10 May 1976, p. 51 =International press coverage= The South Africans had managed to keep their intervention hidden from world view for quite some time. It even took the MPLA until 23 October 1975 to notice that not white mercenaries but the SADF was advancing on Luanda. Yet it took another whole month for the world press to take notice: A day after the South African coastal advance was stopped, two correspondents from Reuters and British Independent Television News published news that South Africans were fighting in Angola.George, p. 96 On 23 November 1975 a major Western newspaper, the Washington Post, announced that regular South African troops were fighting inside Angola. Although other papers were still slow to follow, e.g., the New York Times on 12 December, the fact eventually became internationally known. The South African public had also been kept in the dark, and only on 19 December learned more about what was called the \\"Border War\\" when papers published pictures of SADF soldiers captured by FAPLA and the Cubans.Gleijeses, p. 325 =Southern front= SADF advance is stopped Scope of SADF-operations. By the time FAPLA and the Cubans were able to turn more attention to the southern front after the battle of Quifangondo, the South Africans had gained considerable ground. On 6 and 7 November 1975, Task Force Zulu took the harbour cities of Benguela and Lobito which had been unexpectedly abandoned. The towns and cities taken by the SADF were handed over to UNITA. In central Angola, at the same time, combat unit Foxbat had moved 800 km north toward Luanda. By then it became clear that Luanda could not be taken by independence day on 11 November and the South Africans considered to break off the advance and retreat. But on 10 November 1975 Vorster gave in to UNITA's urgent request to keep up the military pressure with the aim of capturing as much territory as possible before the upcoming meeting of the OAU.George, p. 93 Thus, Zulu and Foxbat continued north with two new battle groups formed further inland (X-Ray and Orange) and \\"there was little reason to think the FAPLA would be able to stop this expanded force from capturing Luanda within a week.\\" George, p. 94 Through November and December 1975, the SADF presence in Angola numbered 2,900 to 3,000 personnel.Spies, F. J. du Toit in. Operasie Savannah. Angola 1975-1976, Pretoria, 1989, p. 215 Zulu now faced stronger resistance advancing on Novo Redondo after which fortunes changed in favour of the FAPLA and the Cubans. The first Cuban reinforcements arrived in Porto Amboim, only a few km north of Novo Redondo, quickly destroying three bridges crossing the Queve river, effectively stopping the South African advance along the coast on 13 November 1975.George, pp. 94-96 Despite concerted efforts to advance north to Novo Redondo, the SADF was unable to break through FAPLA defences.Observer, 7 December 1975, p. 11Times, 11 December 1975, p. 7Gleijeses quoting: du Preez, Sophia in: Avontuur in Angola.

Apart from being \\"bogged down\\" on the southern front,Gleijeses quoting: Secretary of State to all American Republic Diplomatic posts, 20 December 1975, NSA South Africa had to deal with two other major setbacks: the international press taking note of the operation and the shift in U.S. policies. South Africa withdraws In light of these developments, Pretoria had to decide whether it would stay in the game and bring in more troops. In late December 1975, there were heated debates between Vorster, foreign minister Muller, defence minister Botha, head of BOSS (South African Bureau of State Security) van den Bergh and a number of senior officials as to withdraw or to stay. Zaire, UNITA and the U.S. urged South Africa to stay. But the U.S. would not openly endorse the South African intervention and assure continuing military assistance in case of an escalation.

BiermannThom, William in: Angola's 1975-76 Civil War, Autumn 1998, 1-44, p. 31 The sentiment of the Pretoria government at the time was expressed in a speech by Botha before South African parliament on 17 April 1978, in which he charged the U.S. with \\"defaulting on a promise to give them all necessary support in their campaign to defeat the MPLA\\": \\"Against which neighbouring states have we taken aggressive steps? I know of only one occasion in recent years, when we crossed a border and that was in the case of Angola when we did so with the approval and knowledge of the Americans. But they left us in the lurch. We are going to retell that story: the story must be told and how we, with their knowledge, went in there and operated in Angola with their knowledge, how they encouraged us to act and, when we had nearly reached the climax, we were ruthlessly left in the lurch\\".Gleijeses quoting: Botha, P. W., 27 January 1976, Republic of South Africa, House of Assembly Debates, col. 114 Once the decision was made, South Africa rapidly withdrew its forces towards Namibia. In late January, the SADF abandoned the towns of Cela and Novo Redondo Gleijeses quoting: CIA, National Intelligence Daily, 8 January 1976 Apart from a few skirmishes, the Cubans stayed well behind the retreating South Africans and easily overcame the remaining UNITA resistance. By early February 1976, the SADF had retreated to the far south of Angola, leaving behind mine fields and blown up bridges. UNITA's capital, Nova Lisboa (Huambo) fell into FAPLA hands on 8 February, the ports of Lobito and Benguela on 10 February. By 14 February, control of the Benguala railway was complete and on 13 March UNITA lost its last foothold in far south-eastern Angola, Gago Gouthinho (Lumbala N'Guimbo). It is in this attack that the Cubans for the first time employed their airforce.George, p. 112 Four to five thousand SADF troops kept a strip along the Namibian border up to 80 km deep until Angola at least gave assurance that it wouldn't supply bases for SWAPO and that it would continue to supply electricity to Namibia from the Cunene dams.Washington Post, 4 February 1976, p. 1 While the Cubans and FAPLA were slowly approaching the southern border, South Africa and the MPLA took up indirect negotiations about South African withdrawal brokered by the British and Soviet governments. Neto ordered FAPLA and the Cubans to halt at a distance to the border, forestalling what some feared might turn into a much bigger conflict.Time: Recognition, Not Control, 1 March 1976 In exchange for South African recognition, he offered to guarantee the safety of South Africa's 180 million US$ investment in the Cunene hydroelectric complex in northwest Namibia, close to the Angolan border. On 25 March, Botha announced the total withdrawal of South African troops from Angola by 27 March 1976.Gleijeses quoting: Republic of South Africa, House of Assembly Debates, 25 March 1976, cols. 3916-17 On 27 March, the last 60 military vehicles crossed the border into Namibia. =Consolidation= With the withdrawal of South Africa, FNLA and UNITA resistance crumbled and the MPLA was left in sole possession of power. With the help of its Cuban allies the MPLA \\"not only vanquished its bitterest rivals ‚Äì the FNLA and UNITA ‚Äì but in the process had seen off the CIA and humbled the mighty Pretoria war machine.\\" Whatever remained of UNITA retreated into the Angolan bush and Zaire. A number of African countries publicly discredited UNITA for its links with the apartheid government, the CIA and white mercenaries.Brittain, Victoria in: Guardian: Jonas Savimbi, Angolan nationalist whose ambition kept his country at war, 25 February 2002 The United Nations Security Council met to consider \\"the act of aggression committed by South Africa against the People's Republic of Angola\\" and on 31 March 1976, branded South Africa the aggressor, demanding it provide compensation for war damages. Internationally South Africa found itself completely isolated and the failure of its Operation Savannah left it \\"without a single crumb of comfort\\".George, p. 114 \\"The internal repercussions of the Angolan debacle were felt quickly when, on 16 June 1976 ‚Äì emboldened by the FAPLA-Cuban victory ‚Äì the Soweto Uprising began, inaugurating a period of civil unrest which was to continue up until and beyond the collapse of apartheid.\\" Another setback for Pretoria within four years was the end of white minority rule in Rhodesia as it emerged as the next black majority-ruled nation of Zimbabwe, completing the total geographic isolation of apartheid South Africa. Angola obtained recognition by the OAU on 10 February 1976. The OAU recognized the MPLA as Angola's government. The majority of the international community albeit not the U.S. soon did the same. The U.S. was unable to prevent its admittance to the UN General Assembly as its 146th member.George, p. 113 At the height of the deployment in 1976, Cuba had 36,000 military personnel stationed in Angola.afrol News, 6. Dec. 2005 / Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores At their meeting in Conakry on 14 March 1976, when victory was already assured, Castro and Neto decided that the Cubans would withdraw gradually, leaving behind for as long as necessary enough men to organize a strong, modern army, capable of guaranteeing the MPLA's future security without outside help. The Cubans had no intention of getting bogged down in a lengthy internal counter-insurgency and started to reduce their presence in Angola as planned after the retreat of the South Africans. By the end of May, more than 3,000 troops had already returned to Cuba, and many more were on the way.Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Gabriel in: Operation Carlota, 1976, http://www.rhodesia.nl/marquez.htm By the end of the year the Cuban troops had been reduced to 12,000. Fidel Castro 1978 speaking in Havana, Photo: Marcelo Montecino. The Cubans had high hopes that after their victory in Angola, in co-operation with the USSR, they could remove all of southern Africa from the influence of the U.S. and China.Gleijeses quoting: Matthews, Herbert in: Forward with Fidel Castro, Anywhere, New York Times, 4 March 1976, p. 31 In Angola, they put up dozens of training camps for Namibian (SWAPO), Rhodesian (ZAPU) and South African (ANC) guerrillas. An SADF intelligence report in 1977 concluded \\"that SWAPO's standard of training had improved significantly because of the training they had received from the Cuban instructors\\".Scholtz, Leopold, Stellenbosch University, Vol. 34, Issue 1, 2006: The Namibian Border War Cuba saw its second main task in training and equipping the FAPLA which the Soviets generously supplied with sophisticated weapons including tanks and an own air force with MiG-21 fighters. In early 1977, the new Carter administration had in mind to recognize the MPLA-government despite of the presence of Cuban troops assuming they would be withdrawn once the Namibian issue was settled and the southern border of Angola was secure.Wright, George in: The Destruction of a Nation: United States' Policy toward Angola since 1945, Pluto Press, London, Chicago, 1997, , p. 78 The MPLA and Cuban troops had control over all southern cities by 1977, but roads in the south faced repeated UNITA attacks. Savimbi expressed his willingness for rapprochement with the MPLA and the formation of a unity, socialist government, but he insisted on Cuban withdrawal first. \\"The real enemy is Cuban colonialism,\\" Savimbi told reporters, warning, \\"The Cubans have taken over the country, but sooner or later they will suffer their own Vietnam in Angola.\\" On the international stage, Cuba's victory against South Africa boosted Castro's image as one of the top leaders in the Non-Aligned Movement of which he was secretary-general from 1979 to 1983.George Although with Cuba's help the MPLA- government became firmly established, Cuban attempts to hand over the defence of the country failed and it soon became drawn into MPLA's war against UNITA. =Humanitarian engagement= According to the Cubans, the overriding priority of their mission in Angola was humanitarian, not military. In the wake of Operation Carlota, around 5,000 Cuban technical, medical and educational staff were constantly posted in Angola to fill the gaps the Portuguese had left behind. \\"For a generation of Cubans, internationalist service in Angola represented the highest ideal of the Cuban Revolution\\" and for many it became a normal part of life to volunteer for an internationalist mission, principally in Angola, which lasted 18 to 24 months. In the following years, tens of thousands of volunteers were processed each year.George, p. 143 By 1978, Angola's health system was almost completely run by Cuban doctors. After the Portuguese left the country, there was only one doctor per 100,000 inhabitants.George, p. 158 The Cubans posted a large medical team at Luanda's University and Prenda hospitals and opened clinics in remote areas all across Angola. At the time of independence, over 90% of the Angolan population was illiterate. Starting in June 1977, an educational programme began to take shape. 2,000 students were granted scholarships in Cuba and by 1987 there were 4,000 Angolan students studying on the \\"Isla de la Juventud\\" (Isle of Youth). In March 1978, the first Cuban 732-strong secondary school teacher brigade (Destacamento Pedag√≥gico Internationalista) took up its work in Angola. These were later joined by 500 primary school teachers and 60 professors at Luanda's university. Through the 1980s the level was constantly held at about 2,000 teachers of all levels. The technical programme was the largest branch of Cuba's humanitarian mission as Angola was desperate for technicians to oversee the reconstruction projects. Cuban engineers, technicians and construction workers worked on construction sites, especially repairing the badly damaged infrastructure (bridges, roads, buildings, telecommunication etc.) of the country. The first teams arrived in January 1977 and in the following 5 years they built 2,000 houses in Luanda and 50 new bridges, reopened several thousand km of road, electricity and telephone networks. Attempts to revive Angolan coffee and sugar cane production soon failed due to the spread of war with UNITA. According to Cubatecnica, the government office for non-military foreign assistance, there were more Cuban volunteers than could be accepted and long waiting lists.Gr√§fin von D√∂nhoff, Marion in: Die Zeit 36/1988, Die Buren sind aus Angola abgezogen, Pretorias Chance zum Umdenken, p. 7 Cuba's engagement laid the foundations for Angola's social services.George, pp. 158-162 Proxy war, UN resolutions and negotiations (late 1970s and 1980s) In the following years, Cuba kept itself engaged in a number of other African countries. In 1978, Cuba sent 16,000 troops to the Ethiopian Ogaden War, but this time in close coordination with the Soviets. Smaller military missions were active in the People's Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and Benin. Cuban technical, educational and medical staff in the tens of thousands were working in even more countries: Algeria (Tindouf), Mozambique, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Ethiopia, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, Tanzania, the Congo and Benin. Up to 18,000 students from these countries studied on full Cuban scholarships per year on the island.Gleijeses, p. 392 Towards the end of the 1970s and into the 1980s, Angola slipped away from wider international public attention but despite Cuba's victory on the ground, the war in Angola was far from over. UNITA was able to take up its insurgency operations in the south with the help of military and logistical support from South Africa and the MPLA still had not gained control over the whole country. While the vast majority of the Cuban troops remaining in Angola stayed in the bases, some of them helped in 'mopping-up' operations, clearing remaining pockets of resistance in Cabinda and in the north. The operations in the south were less successful because of \\"Savimbi's tenacity and determination to fight on\\".George, p. 115-119 \\"Most of the Cubans were organized and deployed in motorized infantry, air defense, and artillery units. Their main missions were to deter and defend against attacks beyond the southern combat zone, protecting strategic and economically critical sites and facilities, and provide combat support, such as rear-area security for major military installations and Luanda itself. At least 2000 Cuban troops were stationed in oil-producing Cabinda Province\\".Library of Congress Country Data: Angola, Foreign Influences After the South African retreat SWAPO again established bases in southern Angola, now supported by the MPLA, and stepped up its operations in Namibia. In turn, as of early 1977, South African incursions into Angola were on the increase. Cuban forces soon again were increased due to tensions between the MPLA and Zaire in March 1977 (see Shaba I). Mobutu accused the MPLA of instigating and supporting an attack of the Front for the National Liberation of the Congo (FNLC) on the Zairian province of Shaba and Neto charged Mobutu with harbouring and supporting the FNLA and FLEC. Two months later the Cubans played a role in stabilizing the Neto government and foiling the Nitista Plot when Nito Alves and Jos√© van Dunem split from the government and led an uprising. While Cuban soldiers actively helped Neto put down the coup, Alves and Neto both believed the Soviet Union supported Neto's ouster, which is another indication of the mutual distrust between the Soviets and Neto as well as the differing interests between the Soviets and the Cubans.Library of Congress Country StudiesLibrary of Congress Country Studies Ra√∫l Castro sent an additional four thousand troops to prevent further dissension within the MPLA's ranks and met with Neto in August in a display of solidarity. In contrast, Neto's distrust in the Soviet leadership increased and relations with the USSR worsened.Gleijeses quoting George, pp. 129‚Äì131 Thousands of people were estimated to have been killed by Cuban and MPLA troops in the aftermath of Nito's attempted coup over a period that lasted up to two years, with some estimates claiming as high as 70,000 murdered.Sulc, Lawrence. \\"Communists coming clean about their past atrocities.\\" HUMAN EVENTS, (13 October 1990): 12.Ramaer, J.

Angola's Cuando Cubango province In 1977 Britain, Canada, France, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), and the United States formed an informal negotiating team, called the \\"Contact Group\\", to work with South Africa to implement a UN plan for free elections in Namibia. The South African government, however, was fundamentally opposed to the UN plan, which it claimed was biased in favour of the installation of a SWAPO government in Namibia.Collelo, Thomas, ed. Angola: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1991.Library of Congress Country Studies South Africa continued to support UNITA, which not only took up the fight against the MPLA but also helped the South Africans hunt down SWAPO, denying it a safe zone along Angola's southern border. The SADF established bases in Cuando Cubango Province in south-eastern Angola and the South African Air Force (SAAF) supplied UNITA with air cover from bases in Namibia.Library of Congress Country Studies South Africa also went to great lengths to brush up Savimbi's image abroad, especially in the US. Apart from being a friend to some African dictators Savimbi became the toast of the Reagan White House and was feted by the rightwing establishment in many countries.General Magnus Malan, South African Minister of Defence in the film Une Odyss√©e Africaine (France, 2006, 59 min) directed by: Jihan El Tahri Beginning in 1978, periodic South African incursions and UNITA's northward expansion in the east forced the MPLA to increase expenditures on Soviet military aid and to depend even more on military personnel from the USSR, East Germany and Cuba. The first large-scale incursions by the SADF occurred in May 1978 (Operation Reindeer), which became South Africa's most controversial operation in Angola.George, p. 133-134 It involved two simultaneous assaults on a heavily populated SWAPO camps at Cassinga (Kassinga) and Chetequera. SADF intelligence believed Cassinga to be a PLAN (People's Liberation Army of Namibia, the armed wing of SWAPO) camp. The operational order was \\"to inflict maximum losses\\", but where possible, to \\"capture leaders\\".Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa Report, Part Two, pp. 46-54 In the air borne raid on 8 May 1978 (SADF-terminology: Battle of Cassinga) over 600 people were killed, including some women and children. In addition, up to 150 Cubans of a unit rushing to the camp's aid lost their lives in an air attack and ambush on the way from their garrison in Tchamutete 15 km to the south.George, p. 134 Thus, Cuba suffered its highest single-day casualty of its Angolan intervention. According to the controversial findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the camp most likely served civilian as well as a military purposes and the raid constituted a breach of international law and the \\"commission of gross human rights violations\\". SWAPO and the international media branded the incident a massacre turning it into a political disaster for South Africa. The revulsion at the carnage of the \\"Cassinga raid\\" and the ensuing international outcry led to the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 435 on 29 September 1978, calling for Namibia's independence and, to that end, for the establishment of a \\"Transition Assistance Group\\". Pretoria signed the resolution which spelled out the steps for granting independence to Namibia, and according to Bender, raised expectations that peace was in sight in southern Africa.Bender, Gerald in: Peacemaking in Southern Africa: the Luanda-Pretoria tug-of-war, Third World Quarterly 11, January 1989, In Resolution 447 of 28 March 1979, the UN Security Council concluded \\"that the intensity and timing of these acts of armed invasion are intended to frustrate attempts at negotiated settlements in southern Africa\\" and voiced concern \\"about the damage and wanton destruction of property caused by the South African armed invasions of Angola launched from Namibia, a territory which South Africa illegally occupies\\". It strongly condemned \\"the racist regime of South Africa for its premeditated, persistent and sustained armed invasions ... of Angola\\", its \\"utilization of the international territory of Namibia as a springboard for armed invasions and destabilization of ... Angola\\" and demanded that \\"South Africa cease immediately its provocative armed invasions against ...Angola\\". On 2 November 1979 the UN Security Council passed yet another resolution (454), branding South Africa in a similar fashion for its armed incursions, calling upon South Africa \\"to cease immediately all acts of aggression and provocation against ... Angola\\" and \\"forthwith to withdraw all its armed forces from Angola\\" and demanding that \\"South Africa scrupulously respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity ... of Angola\\" and that \\"South Africa desist forthwith from the utilization of Namibia, a territory which it illegally occupies, to launch acts of aggression against ... Angola or other neighbouring African States\\". Nevertheless, by the end of 1979, following the bombing of Lubango, an undeclared war was in full swing. Hardly 2 weeks later, on 17 May 1978, 6,500 Katangese gendarmes invaded the Zairian province of Shaba from bases in eastern Angola and the U.S. accused Cuba of having a hand in it. Although there is no proof for a Cuban involvement it is likely that the Katangese had the support of the MPLA. They were driven back across the border by French and Belgian military and Cuba and the U.S. coaxed Neto and Mobutu to sign a non-aggression pact. While Neto agreed to repatriate the Katangese Mobutu cut off aid to FNLA, FLEC and UNITA and their bases along the border were shut down.George, p. 136 By late 1978 the MPLA's security had been steadily deteriorating and UNITA emerging as a formidable guerrilla army, expanding its operations from Cuando Cubango into Moxico and Bi√© while the SADF intensified its cross-border campaigns from Namibia. Neto died on 10 September 1979 while seeking medical treatment in Moscow and was succeeded by Jose Eduardo Dos Santos. Barely one month later Ronald Reagan became President of the United States, immediately adopting a harder line with the MPLA: The Cubans were absolutely to be driven out of Angola. In elections held in February 1980; the leader of the leftist Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and outspoken opponent of apartheid, Robert Mugabe, was elected president, ending white minority rule in Zimbabwe. Losing its last ally (Rhodesia) in the region, South Africa adopted the policy of \\"Total Onslaught\\" vowing \\"to strike back at any neighbouring states which harboured anti- apartheid forces\\".George, p. 139 On 10 June 1980 Pretoria launched its largest operation since World War II, 180 km into Angola, during which, for the first time, it was attacked by the FAPLA. In the following September, the SADF assisted UNITA in the capture of Mavinga. In the early 1980s, the United States, in their endeavour to get the USSR and Cuba out of Angola, became directly involved in negotiations with the MPLA. The MPLA argued it could safely reduce the number of Cuban troops and Soviet advisors if it wasn't for the continuing South African incursions and threat at its southern border. The most obvious solution was an independent Namibia which South Africa had to give up. After having to accept a leftist regime in Angola, Pretoria was reluctant to relinquish control of Namibia because of the possibility that the first elections would bring its \\"traditional nemesis\\", SWAPO, to power. It continued to attend negotiating sessions of the Contact Group throughout the early 1980s, always prepared to bargain but never ready to settle. Cuba, not involved in the negotiations, basically agreed to such a solution paving the way to Namibia's independence. Yet, towards the end of Reagan's second term in office, the negotiations had not born any fruit. After the UN-sponsored talks on the future of Namibia failed in January 1981, (South Africa walked out of the Pre-Implementation Conference in Geneva on 13 January ) in April 1981 the new American Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Chester Crocker, took up negotiations combining 'constructive engagement with South Africa' with the 'linkage' proposal (independence for Namibia in change for Cuba's withdrawal). Both the MPLA and South Africa deeply distrusted the U.S. for various reasons and the idea was rejected. It continued to be the basis of further negotiations; yet, the Contact Group members as well as the 'frontline states' (states bordering South Africa) were opposed to linking Namibian independence with Cuban withdrawal.Wright, George in: The Destruction of a Nation: United States' Policy toward Angola since 1945, Pluto Press, London, Chicago, 1997, , p. 101 Despite its overwhelming presence in Angola, the Cubans remained uninvited to the negotiations.George, pp. 171-179 The same year, South African military activity increased against MPLA targets and SWAPO guerrillas. On 23 August 1981, the SADF launched Operation Protea with eleven thousand troops penetrating 120 kilometres into southwestern Angola and occupying about 40,000 km2 in southern Cunene (holding the territory until 1988). Bases were established in Xangongo and N'Giva. The South Africans not only fought SWAPO but also wanted FAPLA out of the border area and openly intensified assaults on Angolan economic targets. The U.S. vetoed a UN Resolution condemning the operation, instead insisting on Cuba's withdrawal from Angola.Wright, George in: The Destruction of a Nation: United States' Policy toward Angola since 1945, Pluto Press, London, Chicago, 1997, , p. 102 Within five months of the South African intervention the Soviets started a new two-year military programme for the FAPLA to which Cuba committed another 7,000 troops. FAPLA-Cuban forces refrained from larger actions against South African operations, which were routinely undertaken deep into MPLA territory following Operation Protea.George, pp. 142, 164-170 Through 1982 and 1983 the SAAF also participated in operations by UNITA, which gained more and more control of south-eastern Angola. The attacks by far exceeded the previous hit and -run operations and were aimed primarily at the Benguela Railway. Increasingly Cubans got involved in the fighting, either because they had garrisons in the embattled area or because they came to the rescue of FAPLA units under attack. The civil war had a crippling effect on the Angolan economy, especially agriculture and infrastructure, created hundreds of thousands of refugees. UNITA guerrillas took foreign technicians as hostages.The Library of Congress, February 1989 On 6 December 1983 Pretoria launched its twelfth incursion, Operation Askari, in pursuit of SWAPO which was also to inflict as much damage as possible on FAPLA's increasing military presence in southern Angola. In protest, France and shortly after Canada, left the UN Contact Group. On 20 December the UN Security Council passed yet another resolution (546) demanding withdrawal and reparations by South Africa. Unlike during Operation Protea this operation was met with strong resistance by the FAPLA-Cuban forces leading to the fiercest fighting since independence. A battle ensued after a SADF attack on a SWAPO camp near Cuvelei (northern Cunene) on 3 ‚Äì 7 January 1984. Although SWAPO suffered a severe defeat in this campaign the South Africans were unable to unseat the FAPLA from bases at Cahama, Mulondo and Caiundo as it had planned. Under growing international pressure Pretoria stopped the operation and retreated south of the border on 15 January but kept the garrisons in Calueque, N'Giva and Xangongo. A cease fire between the MPLA and South Africa was signed on 31 January, the first treaty between Luanda and Pretoria. Peace negotiations were taken up again and in February 1984 Crocker met with the MPLA and South Africans in Lusaka, Zambia. The resulting first 'Lusaka Accord' of 16 February 1984 detailed the disengagement of MPLA and South African forces in southern Angola. Already during this process the accord was doomed to fail because SWAPO was not involved in the talks and continued its operations. UNITA also stepped up its raids including mine-laying, truck bombs, hostage taking and attacking foreign civilians as far north as Sumbe.George, p. 142, 184-185 In a joint statement on 19 March 1984 Cuba and the MPLA announced the principles on which a Cuban withdrawal would be negotiated: unilateral withdrawal of the SADF, implementation of Resolution 435 and cessation of support for UNITA and armed actions in Angola. Cuban withdrawal would be a matter between Cuba and Angola. In a similar joint announcement in 1982 these principles had been formulated as demands. The proposal was rejected by Botha.George, pp. 142, 183-184 In September 1984 the MPLA presented a plan calling for the retreat of all Cubans to positions north of the 13th parallel and then to the 16th parallel, again on the condition that South Africa pulled out of Namibia and respected Resolution 435. 10.000 Cuban troops around the capital and in Cabinda were to remain. A major obstacle in the negotiations was the timeline for the withdrawal of Cuban troops. While Pretoria demanded a maximum of 7 months the Cubans wanted four years. Crocker managed to reduce the Cuban's timeline to two years upon which the South Africans suggested only 12 weeks. Crocker then proposed a timeline of 2 years and a withdrawal in stages and a maximum of 6,000 troops remaining up to another year in the north. But both parties and UNITA rejected this proposal and the negotiations stalled. On 17 April Pretoria installed an 'Interim Government' in Namibia which was in direct contravention of Resolution 435.George, p. 142, 188-190 The Lusaka Accord completely fell apart when South Africa broke the cease-fire. On 20 May 1985 it sent a commando team to blow up an American-run Gulf Oil facility in northern Angola. The raid failed, but it showed that Pretoria was \\"not interested in a cease-fire agreement or the Namibian settlement to which a cease-fire was supposed to lead.\\" Smith, p. 63 On 10 July 1985 the U.S. Congress rescinded the 10-year-old Clark Amendment. Within a year at least seven bills and resolutions followed urging aid to UNITA, including overt military support and some US$15 million. From 1986 the U.S. openly supported UNITA.Wright, George in: The Destruction of a Nation: United States' Policy toward Angola since 1945, Pluto Press, London, Chicago, 1997, , p. 118 By 1986 the war reached a stalemate: FAPLA was unable to uproot UNITA in its tribal stronghold and UNITA was no serious threat to the government in Luanda.Smith, p. 61 Within a week Pretoria, suffering from internal unrest and international sanctions, declared a State of Emergency.George, pp. 142, 191 Cuba's second intervention =Escalation of the conflict= As a result of the South African Operation Askari in December 1983, which targeted People's Liberation Army of Namibia bases inside Angola, the USSR not only increased its aid to the MPLA but also took over the tactical and strategic leadership of FAPLA, deploying advisors right down to the battalion level, and began planning a large-scale offensive against the UNITA-stronghold in southeastern Angola. Soviet command did not include the Cuban forces in Angola.George, p. 183 Cuba's strategic opinions differed considerably from those of the Soviets and MPLA and Cuba strongly advised against an offensive in the southeast because it would create the opportunity for a significant South African intervention, which is what transpired. A FAPLA-offensive in 1984 had already brought dismal results. Under Soviet leadership the FAPLA launched two more offensives in 1985 and 1986. The Cubans deny involvement in the 1985 operation but supported the offensive in 1986 despite many reservations, not providing ground forces but technical and air support. Apart from taking Cazombo in 1985, coming close to Mavinga and bringing UNITA close to defeat, both offensives ended in a complete failure and became a major embarrassment for the Soviets. Unlike the Cubans with ten years of experience in the African theatre, the Soviet leadership was inexperienced and relations between the two became strained. In addition, in March 1985 Mikhail Gorbachev had become the new General Secretary with whom Castro had considerable disagreements. In both FAPLA-offensives South Africa, still controlling the lower reaches of southwestern Angola, intervened as soon as UNITA came into distress. In September 1985, the South African Air Force prevented the fall of Mavinga and the FAPLA-offensive ended at the Lomba River. After this debacle in 1985, the Soviets sent more equipment and advisors to Angola and immediately went about preparing another FAPLA-offensive in the following year. In the meantime UNITA received its first military aid from the U.S., which included surface-to-air Stinger missiles and BGM-71 TOW anti-tank-missiles. The U.S. sent supplies to UNITA and SADF through the reactivated Kamina Airbase in Zaire. The offensive starting in May 1986 already got off to a poor start and again with the help of the SADF UNITA managed to stop the advance by late August.George, pp. 192-199 =Cuito Cuanavale= Preparations went on their way for the next offensive in 1987, Opera√ß√£o Saudando Outubro and once more the Soviets upgraded the FAPLA's equipment including 150 T-55 and T-54B tanks and Mi-24 and Mi-8/Mi-17 helicopters. Again they dismissed warnings of a South African intervention. Pretoria, taking notice of the massive military build-up around Cuito Cuanavale, warned UNITA and on 15 June authorized covert support. In spite of these preparations, on 27 July Castro proposed Cuba's participation in the negotiations, indicating that he was interested in curtailing its involvement in Angola. The Reagan administration declined.George, p. 201 From the very start of the FAPLA-offensive it was clear to Pretoria that UNITA could not withstand the onslaught and on 4 August 1987 launched clandestine Operation Moduler, which engaged in the first fights nine days later. The FAPLA reached the northern banks of the Lomba River near Mavinga on 28 August and were expected by the SADF. In a series of bitter fights between 9 September and 7 October they prevented the FAPLA from crossing the river and stopped the offensive for a third time. The FAPLA suffered heavy losses and the Soviets withdrew their advisors from the scene, leaving FAPLA without senior leadership. On 29 September the SADF launched an offensive aiming to destroy all FAPLA forces east of the Cuito River. On 3 October it attacked and annihilated a FAPLA battalion on the southern banks of the Lomba River and two days later FAPLA started its retreat to Cuito Cuanavale.George, pp. 206-208 The SADF and UNITA pursued the retreating FAPLA units and started the siege of Cuito Cuanavale on 14 October with long-range shelling by 155-mm artillery from a distance of 30 to 40 km. Cuito Cuanavale, only a village, was important to FAPLA as a forward air base to patrol and defend southern Angola and considered an important gateway to UNITA's headquarters in the southeast. With the South Africans on the counter-attack, the town and base and possibly all of Cuando Cubango were now under threat, as was FAPLA's planned advance southwards against UNITA; on 15 November Luanda requested urgent military assistance from Cuba. Castro approved the Cuban intervention, Operation Maniobra XXXI Anniversario on the same day, retaking the initiative from the Soviets. As in 1975, Cuba again did not inform the USSR in advance of its decision to intervene.Saney, Isaac in: African Stalingrad: The Cuban Revolution, Internationalism and the End of Apartheid, Latin American Perspectives, Vol. 33, No. 5 (September 2006): pp. 81-117 For the second time Cuba dispatched a large contingent of troops and arms across the ocean: 15,000 troops and equipment, including tanks, artillery, anti-aircraft weapons and aircraft. Although not responsible for the dismal situation of the FAPLA Cuba felt impelled to intervene in order to prevent a total disaster for the MPLA. In Castro's view, a UNITA and South African victory would have meant the capture of Cuito and the destruction of the best MPLA military formations. Around mid-January Castro let the MPLA know that he was taking charge and the first Cuban enforcements were deployed at Cuito Cuanavale.Barber, Simon in: Castro explains, why Angola lost battle against the SADF, 27 July 1989 The Cubans' initial priority was saving Cuito Cuanavale, but while enforcements were arriving at the besieged garrison they made preparations for a second front in Lubango, where the SADF had been operating unhindered for where years.Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa Report, Part Two, p. 59George, pp. 210-212 By early November, the SADF had cornered FAPLA units in Cuito Cuanavale and was poised to destroy them. On 25 November the UN Security Council demanded the SADF's unconditional withdrawal from Angola by 10 December, but the U.S. ensured that there were no repercussions for South Africa. U.S. Assistant Secretary for Africa Chester Crocker reassured Pretoria's ambassador: \\"The resolution did not contain a call for comprehensive sanctions, and did not provide for any assistance to the MPLA. That was no accident, but a consequence of our own efforts to keep the resolution within bounds.\\" Gleijeses quoting: Secretary of State to American Embassy, Pretoria, 5 December 1987, Freedom of Information Act Through December the situation for the besieged MPLA became critical as the SADF tightened the noose around Cuito Cuanavale. Observers expected it to fall into South African hands soon, and UNITA prematurely announced the town had been taken. Starting 21 December the South Africans planned the final operation to \\"pick off\\" the five FAPLA brigades which were still to the east of the Cuito river \\"before moving in to occupy the town if the conditions were favourable\\".George, p. 214 From mid-January to the end of February the SADF launched six major assaults on FAPLA positions east of the Cuito river, none of which delivered tangible results. Although the first attack on 13 January 1988 was successful, spelling near disaster for a FAPLA brigade, the SADF was unable to continue and retreated to its starting positions. After a month the SADF was ready for the second assault on 14 February. Again it withdrew after successfully driving FAPLA-Cuban units off the Chambinga high ground. Narrowly escaping catastrophe the FAPLA units east of the Cuito River withdrew to the Tumpo (river) triangle, a smaller area, ideally suited to defence. On 19 February the SADF suffered a first major setback when a third assault against a FAPLA battalion north of the Dala river was repelled; the SADF was unable to reach FAPLA's forward positions and had to withdraw. In the following days the Cubans stepped up their air attacks against South African positions. On 25 February the FAPLA-Cubans repelled a fourth assault and the SADF had to retreat to their positions east of the Tumpo River. The failure of this attack \\"proved a turning point of the battle of Cuito Cuanavale, boosting FAPLA's flagging morale and bringing the South African advance to a standstill.\\" George, p. 227 A fifth attempt was beaten back on 29 February, delivering the SADF a third consecutive defeat. After some more preparation the South Africans launched their last and fourth unsuccessful attack on 23 March. As SADF-Colonel Jan Breytenbach wrote, the South African assault \\"was brought to a grinding and definite halt\\" by the combined Cuban and FAPLA forces. Eventually Cuban troop strength in Angola increased to about 55,000, with 40,000 deployed in the south. Due to the international arms embargo since 1977, South Africa's aging air force was outclassed by the sophisticated Soviet-supplied air defence system and air-strike capabilities fielded by the MPLA, and it was unable to uphold the air supremacy it had enjoyed for years; its loss in turn proved to be critical to the outcome of the battle on the ground. Cuito Cuanavale was the major battle site between Cuban, Angolan, Namibian and South African forces. It was the biggest battle on African soil since World War II and in its course just under 10,000 soldiers were killed. Cuban planes and 1,500 Cuban soldiers had reinforced the MPLA at Cuito. After the failed assault on 23 March 1988, the SADF withdrew leaving a 1,500-man \\"holding force\\" behind and securing their retreat with one of the most heavily mined areas in the world. Cuito Cuanavale continued to be bombarded from a distance of 30 to 40 km.George, p. 234 =Western front= In the meantime, on 10 March 1988, when the defence of Cuito Cuanavale after three failed SADF attacks was secure, Cuban, FAPLA and SWAPO units advanced from Lubango to the southwest. The first South African resistance was encountered near Calueque on 15 March, followed by three months of bloody clashes as the Cubans progressed towards the Namibian border. By the end of May Cuba had two divisions in southwestern Angola. By June they constructed two forward airbases at Cahama and Xangongo with which Cuban air power could be projected into Namibia. All of southern Angola was covered by a radar network and SA-8 air defence ending South African air superiority.George, pp. 236-237 On 26 May 1988, the chief of the SADF announced, \\"heavily armed Cuban and SWAPO forces, integrated for the first time, have moved south within 60km of the Namibian border\\". The remaining SADF forces at Cuito Cuanavale were now in danger of being closed in. On 8 June 1988 the SADF called up 140,000 men of the reserves (Citizen Force), giving an indication of how serious the situation had become. The South African administrator general in Namibia acknowledged on 26 June that Cuban MiG-23s were flying over Namibia, a dramatic reversal from earlier times when the skies had belonged to the SAAF. He added, \\"the presence of the Cubans had caused a flutter of anxiety\\" in South Africa.Mail & Guardian Online: Piero Gleijeses, Cuito Cuanavale revisited, ANALYSIS, 11 July 2007 In June 1988 the Cubans prepared to advance on Calueque starting from Xangongo and Tchipa. In case of serious South African counterattacks, Castro gave orders to be ready to destroy the Ruacana reservoirs and transformers and attack South African bases in Namibia. The offensive started from Xangongo on 24 June immediately clashing with the SADF en route to Cuamato. Although the SADF was driven off, the FAPLA-Cubans retreated to their base. On 26 July 1989 the SADF shelled Tchipa (Techipa) with long-range artillery and Castro gave orders for the immediate advance on Calueque and an air strike against the SADF camps and military installations around Calueque. After a clash with a FAPLA-Cuban advance group on 27 June the SADF retreated towards Calueque under bombardment from Cuban planes and crossed the border into Namibia that same afternoon. By then, Cuban MiG-23s had carried out the attacks on the SADF positions around the Calueque dam, 11 km north of the Namibian border, also damaging the bridge and hydroelectric installations. The major force of the Cubans, still on the way, never saw action and returned to Tchipa. With the retreat of the SADF into Namibia on 27 June the hostilities ceased.George, pp. 243-246 The CIA reported that \\"Cuba's successful use of air power and the apparent weakness of Pretoria's air defences\\" highlighted the fact that Havana had achieved air superiority in southern Angola and northern Namibia. Only a few hours after the Cuban air strike, the SADF destroyed the nearby bridge over the Cunene River. They did so, the CIA surmised, \\"to deny Cuban and Angolan ground forces easy passage to the Namibia border and to reduce the number of positions they must defend.\\" Gleijeses quoting: CIA, \\"South Africa-Angola-Cuba\\", 29 June 1988, Freedom of Information Act and CIA, \\"South Africa-Angola-Namibia\\", 1 July 1988, Freedom of Information Act The South Africans, impressed by the suddenness and scale of the Cuban advance and believing that a major battle \\"involved serious risks\\" withdrew.Gleijeses quoting: Abramowitz (Bureau of Intelligence and Research, U.S. Department of State) to Secretary of State, 13 May 1988, Freedom of Information Act Five days later Pretoria ordered a combat group still operational in southeastern Angola to scale back to avoid any more casualties, effectively withdrawing from all fighting, and a SADF division was deployed in defence of Namibia's northern border.George, p. 245 Cuba and the Three Powers Accord The negotiations and accords until 1988 had all been bilateral, either between MPLA and the U.S., MPLA and South Africa or the U.S. and South Africa. Luanda refused any direct contact with UNITA, instead looking for direct talks with Savimbi's sponsors in Pretoria and Washington. The negotiations usually took place in third countries and were mediated by third countries. The U.S., although clandestinely supporting the UNITA, often acted as a mediator itself. From 1986, the Soviet Union expressed its interest in a political solution. It was increasingly included in consultations but never directly involved in the negotiations. Endeavours for a settlement had intensified after the fighting in southern Angola broke out in 1987. It was agreed, that this time only governments were to take part in the negotiations, which excluded participation by UNITA. From the start of the negotiations in 1981, the Cubans had not asked and were not asked to participate and the Americans did not have it in mind to include them. Castro signalled interest to the U.S. in July 1987 while preparations for the FAPLA offensive against UNITA were under way. He let the Americans know that negotiations including the Cubans would be much more promising. But it was not until January 1988 that U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz authorized the American delegation to hold direct talks with the Cubans with the strict provision that they only discuss matters of Angola and Namibia but not the US embargo against Cuba. The Cuban government joined negotiations on 28 January 1988. They conceded that their withdrawal had to include all troops in Angola including the 5,000 they had in mind to keep in the north and in Cabinda for protection of the oil fields. Yet, U.S. support for UNITA was going to be continued and was not to be an issue at the discussions.George, p. 221 The U.S. continued its two-track policy, mediating between Luanda and Pretoria as well as providing aid to UNITA through Kamina airbase in Zaire.Wright, George in: The Destruction of a Nation. United States Policy Towards Angola since 1945, Pluto Press, London, Chicago, 1997, , p. 131 The Reagan administration's first priority was to get the Cubans out of Angola. In its terminology, by supporting UNITA the U.S. was conducting \\"low-intensity-warfare\\". According to a western diplomat in Luanda, the U.S. \\"first wanted to get the Cubans out and afterwards wanted to ask the South Africans to kindly retreat from Namibia\\". David Albright reported that South African officials believe that Armscor's preparations for a nuclear test at Vastrap were discovered by Soviet or Western intelligence agencies, and that this discovery led to increased pressure on Cuba and the Soviet Union to withdraw from Angola. Crocker had initially been unable to convince anyone in Europe of his linkage concept, which tied Namibian independence to Cuban withdrawal. On the contrary, the European Union was ready to help with Angolan reconstruction. Pretoria had walked out of the negotiations two years before and it was necessary to get South Africa back to the table. On 16 March 1988, the South African Business Day reported that Pretoria was \\"offering to withdraw into Namibia -- not from Namibia -- in return for the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola. The implication is that South Africa has no real intention of giving up the territory any time soon.\\" After much coaxing the South African government joined negotiations in Cairo on 3 May 1988 expecting Resolution 435 to be modified. Defence Minister Malan and President P.W. Botha asserted that South Africa would withdraw from Angola only \\"if Russia and its proxies did the same.\\" They did not mention withdrawing from Namibia. In July 1987, Cuba and Angola had offered to speed up Cuban withdrawal. 20,000 troops stationed south of the 13th parallel could be sent home within two instead of three years on the condition that the SADF retreated from Angola, that U.S. and South African support for UNITA was terminated, that Angola's sovereignty was respected and UN Resolution 435 was implemented. Botha flatly rejected any move before the Cubans withdrew from Angola. In order to \\"torpedo\\" the initiatives, Malan \\"innocently\\" suggested direct negotiations with Moscow so that the Angola conflict could be solved after the example of Afghanistan. The Kremlin responded mockingly that Angola and Afghanistan hardly had more in common than the initial letters in their name. Thus, the timeframe of withdrawal remained the biggest obstacle for a settlement. Chester Crocker proposed a tighter timeframe of total withdrawal within three years which the Angolans rejected.Wright, George in: The Destruction of a Nation. United States Policy Towards Angola since 1945, Pluto Press, London, Chicago, 1997, , p. 134 It was only after the battle at Cuito Cuanavale that the Botha government showed a real interest in peace negotiations. The Cuban military strategy in southern Angola in 1988 brought urgency to the negotiations. After stopping the SADF counter offensive at Cuito Cuanavale and opening a second front to the west, the Cubans in Angola had raised the stakes and reversed the situation on the ground. In fact, the U.S. wondered whether the Cubans would stop their advance at the Namibian border.Gleijeses quoting: \\"Entrevista de Risquet con Chester Crocker, 26/6/88\\", ACC The heavy loss of life at Calueque sparked outrage in South Africa and it ordered an immediate retrenchment. The SADF forces remaining in eastern Angola were instructed to avoid further casualties. After the bloody clashes on 27 June, the SADF on 13 July set up 10 Division in defence of northern Namibia, in case the Cubans attempted an invasion. Thus, Jorge Risquet, head of the Cuban delegation, responded to South African demands: \\"The time for your military adventures, for the acts of aggression that you have pursued with impunity, for your massacres of refugees... is over‚Ä¶ South Africa is acting as though it was a victorious army, rather than what it really is: a defeated aggressor that is withdrawing... South Africa must face the fact that it will not obtain at the negotiating table what it could not achieve on the battlefield.\\" Gleijeses quoting: \\"Actas das Conversa√ß√¥es Quadripartidas entre a RPA, Cuba, Estados Unidos de Am√©rica e a Africa do Sul realizadas no Cairo de 24-26.06.988\\", Archives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, Havana Crocker cabled Secretary of State George Shultz that the talks had taken place \\"against the backdrop of increasing military tension surrounding the large build-up of heavily armed Cuban troops in south-west Angola in close proximity to the Namibian border.... The Cuban build-up in southwest Angola has created an unpredictable military dynamic.\\" Gleijeses quoting: Crocker to Secretary of State, 26 June 1988, Freedom of Information Act The Cubans were the driving force behind the negotiations in the final phase beginning in July 1988. The MPLA allies, first wanting to maintain the status quo after the successes in the south, had to be persuaded to continue. Worried that the fighting in Cunene escalated into an all-out war, Crocker achieved a first breakthrough in New York on 13 July. The Cubans replaced Jorge Risquet by the more conciliatory Carlos Aldana Escalante and agreed in general to withdraw from Angola in turn for Namibian independence. (See also Tripartite Accord (Angola) for Botha's account of his coming to an understanding with Risquet, as documented in the 2007 French documentary Cuba, an African Odyssey.) Cuba's calculations were simple: Once the South Africans were out of Namibia and Resolution 435 was implemented, Pretoria would be without a safe base to operate from and to destabilize the MPLA government. The Luanda government could hold off UNITA without Cuban help. Cuba also figured that SWAPO, their regional ally, would pipe the tune in Namibia. In the \\"New York Principles\\" the parties agreed to settle their differences through negotiations. The following round of talks in Cape Verde, 22‚Äì23 July 1988, only produced a commitment to set up a Joint Monitoring Commission which was to oversee the withdrawals. On 5 August, the three parties signed the \\"Geneva Protocol\\" laying out South African withdrawal from Angola starting 10 August and to be completed 1 September. By then Cubans and the MPLA were to agree on Cuban troop withdrawal. On 10 September a tripartite peace settlement was to be signed and Resolution 435 was to be implemented on 1 November.George, pp. 247-249 A ceasefire came into effect on 8 August 1988.Alao, Abiodun. Brothers at War: Dissidence and Rebellion in Southern Africa, 1994. Pages XIX-XXI. Pretoria pulled its remaining forces out of Angola by 30 August 1988. Cuban and SWAPO forces moved away from the southern border. By then, a formula for the Cuban withdrawal from Angola had not been found as there was still a gap of 41 months between the Cuban and South African proposal and it took another five rounds of talks between August and October 1988 to find a settlement. The negotiations were interrupted to await the outcome of the U.S. elections in which George H. W. Bush succeeded Ronald Reagan on 8 November 1988. In the meantime, a FAPLA offensive was under way and UNITA was close to collapse threatening another South African intervention and putting Cuban forces in Angola on alert. Yet, Pretoria did not have in mind to endanger the talks and refrained from interference. It was only after the U.S. elections that the parties agreed on a timetable for the Cubans. On 22 December 1988, one month before Reagan's second term ended, Angola, Cuba and South Africa signed the Three Powers Accord in New York, arranging for the withdrawal of South African troops from Angola and Namibia, the independence of Namibia and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. Cuba agreed to an overall time frame of 30 months and to withdraw within 27 months after implementation of Resolution 435. The timetable agreed upon provided for the following steps: *until 1 April 1989: withdrawal of 3,000 Cuban troops (3 months) *1 April 1989: Implementation of Resolution 435 and start of 27-month time frame for total withdrawal *1 August 1989: all Cuban troops moved north of 15th parallel (7 months) *31 October 1989: all Cuban troops moved north of 13th parallel (10 months) *1 November 1989: free elections in Namibia and 50% of all Cuban troops withdrawn from Angola *1 April 1990: 66% of all Cuban troops withdrawn (15 months) *1 October 1990: 76% of all Cuban troops withdrawn (21 months) *1 July 1991: Cuban withdrawal completed (30 months)George, Edward, pp. 253‚Äì255 The accord ended 13 years of Cuban military presence in Angola which was finalized one month early on 25 May 1991, when General Samuel Rodiles Planas boarded the aircraft that took him back to the island. At the same time the Cubans removed their troops from Pointe Noire (Republic of the Congo) and Ethiopia. Aftermath Cuban intervention had a substantial impact on Southern Africa, especially in defending the MPLA's control over large parts of Angola as well as helping secure Namibia's independence. On 26 July 1991, on occasion of the celebrations of the 38th anniversary of the start of the Cuban Revolution, Nelson Mandela delivered a speech in Havana praising Cuba for its role in Angola: > The Cuban people hold a special place in the hearts of the people of Africa. > The Cuban internationalists have made a contribution to African > independence, freedom and justice unparalleled for its principled and > selfless character - We in Africa are used to being victims of countries > wanting to carve up our territory or subvert our sovereignty.

The communists had > attacked and destroyed many churches. MiG-23s and Mi-24 Hind helicopter gun > ships were terrorising villagers in Angola. I documented numerous > atrocities, including the strafing of villages, schools and > churches.Hammond, Peter,Reagan Saved Lives in Angola , FrontLine Fellowship, > accessed August 9, 2012. In a national ceremony on 7 December 1988, all Cubans killed in Africa were buried in cemeteries across the island. According to Cuban government figures, during all of the Cuban foreign intervention missions carried out in Africa from the early 1960s to the withdrawal of the last soldier from Angola on 25 May 1991, a total of 2,289 Cubans were killed. Other analysts have noted that of 36,000 Cuban troops committed to fighting in Angola from 1975 to 1979, combat deaths were close to 5,000 in number. Free elections in Namibia were held in November 1989 with SWAPO taking 57% of the vote in spite of Pretoria's attempts to swing the elections in favor of other parties.The Guardian, 26 July 1991New York Times, 26.07.89: The United States has complained...., New York Times, 12.08.89: American Group Finds Obstacles To Free and Fair Vote in Namibia, New York Times, 03.11.89: Pretoria Playing Down Namibia 'Infiltration', New York Times, 28.11.89: South-West African Police became Pretoria's paramount armed presence..., New York Times, 29.07.91: $35 million to seven political parties... (see Martti Ahtisaari and History of Namibia). Namibia gained independence in March 1990. The situation in Angola was anything but settled and the country continued to be ravaged by civil war for more than a decade. The MPLA won the 1992 election, however eight opposition parties rejected the 1992 election as rigged. UNITA sent peace negotiators to the capital, where the MPLA murdered them, along with thousands of UNITA members. Savimbi was still ready to continue the elections. The MPLA then massacred tens of thousands of UNITA voters nationwide,National Society for Human Rights, Ending the Angolan Conflict, Windhoek, Namibia, 3 July 2000 (opposition parties, massacres); John Matthew, Letters, The Times, UK, 6 November 1992 (election observer); NSHR, Press Releases, 12 September 2000, 16 May 2001 (MPLA atrocities). in an event known as the Halloween Massacre. UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi would not accept the results and refused to join the Angolan parliament as opposition. Again UNITA took up arms, financed with the sale of blood diamonds. The civil war ended in 2002 after Jonas Savimbi was killed in battle.

The eldest child of a railway baggage porter and a seamstress, he had to help support the family financially to ensure that his seven siblings were able to finish their education, while he studied to be a teacher. He was born in Santiago, Chile in 1919, when the world was reeling from the First World War. He experienced poverty and inequality firsthand, and had to strive hard to overcome them. He grew up in the Santiago barrio of Estaci√≥n Central, which in those days was on the outskirts of the city. His teenage years coincided with the devastating effects of the Great Depression in the thirties in Chile, when the country suffered the bankruptcies and layoffs that provoked the worst social crisis in Latin America's history. He married in secret so he could stay to care for his family, instead of starting his own household. The first of his family to get an education, he made sure his siblings got the same opportunity, and later taught art to underprivileged and special needs children. In his first post as a teacher, in the southern city of Puerto Natales, Chile, he taught classes of children who came to school barefoot in spite of the cold, in a small school with glassless windows, shaken by the gusts of icy wind typical of the Chilean south. Most of his students could not read or write, nor could their parents. He succeeded in helping several of these children on the road to success, and in the process he acquired the conviction that his country was in need of profound change. It was in those years that he came to define himself as a socialist, a conviction which he held to the end of his days. On returning to Santiago, he enrolled to study Fine Arts at the University of Chile, where he stood out as one of the most promising students, and for his activity as a student leader, as he became president of the student centre. In 1945, Osvaldo, along with Fernando Marcos, Carmen Cereceda and other mural painters from the School of Fine Arts, formed the \\"Group of Mural Painters of the Ministry of Education\\", their goal being to paint murals in the schools of Chile. One of the goals of this project was to involve children and give them the technical skills to go on to become artists. For his academic achievements, he received a scholarship to study painting in Mexico, where he studied art with the great Mexican muralists David Alfaro Siqueiros, Diego Rivera, Federico Cantu, Francisco de la Maza, Jose Gutierrez and Raul Anguiano. The Mexican influence on Osvaldo Reyes‚Äô painting would always be evident in its expressive vigour and luminosity, as well as in the lines and shapes that characterized his drawing. During his stay in Mexico, he worked for three months as an assistant to the Nobel Award winner Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral. In his return to Chile he painted the mural \\"La Ronda\\", which was inspired by the work of Gabriela Mistral of the same name. On returning from his scholarship, he became absorbed in academic work. He helped other painters to go to Mexico to study. He participated in the travelling mural exhibition ‚ÄúLas 40 Medidas‚Äù (‚ÄúThe 40 Measures‚Äù), inspired by Allende‚Äôs presidential program in 1970, which travelled around the country. The panels from this exhibition were destroyed by the dictatorship. He was a professor and director of the Escuela Experimental Artistica until September, 1973. This institution is known for producing hundreds of Chilean artists in a wide variety of artistic disciplines. In the mid 1960s Osvaldo was involved, along with his students and other collaborators, in the painting of the pro Allende political murals. The Escuela Experimental Art√≠stica was a unique establishment in Latin America, which offered grants to artistically talented children from all over the country and brought them to Santiago to receive primary, secondary and art education; it was an innovative public education project which was later copied in other countries. Hundreds of Chilean artists from all disciplines studied in this school. Shortly after the military coup, Reyes was dismissed from his position by the Pinochet dictatorship. He was lucky; more than a thousand people were detained and disappeared, another thousand murdered, more than thirty thousand tortured and hundreds of thousands forced into exile in the 17 years of the Pinochet regime. In 1978 Reyes left with his wife, Carmen, and the two youngest of their five children for Mexico and worked at the San Carlos Academy of Art for ten years. The family's separation tormented him, so when some of their older offspring later moved to Canada, Reyes and his wife followed in 1988. With this move, Osvaldo Reyes had to adapt to a new culture, a new language, and, above all, a greater distance from his native land. He succeeded in making his way in Canada, which also became home to his family. In his Toronto workshop, he painted and drew with discipline every day. His work has been exhibited in Chile, Mexico, and Canada and in 2003, on the 30th anniversary of the military coup, Reyes presented a retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Santiago, Chile, sponsored by the Canadian Embassy in Santiago, the Chilean Consulate in Toronto and the Bureau for the Chilean Community Abroad. The Mexican muralist Raul Anguiano commented in 1987 that Osvaldo Reyes' work can be placed \\"among the Latin American masters such as Guayasamin, Amelia Perez o Portinari, with a modernist touch that resembles the work of Leger and other German expressionists\\". He died in Toronto, Canada after suffering a stroke.

The operation was proposed and set up by Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez, with the permission of the Colombian government of √Ålvaro Uribe. Ch√°vez's plan was supported by the governments of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, and France, as well as the Red Cross, which also participated in the operation. Venezuelan aircraft were flown to an airport in the Colombian town of Villavicencio, were resupplied, and from there flew to the secret rescue point set up by the FARC.AP: Chavez: Colombia Hostages May Be Freed On December 26, 2007, through the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Colombian government approved the mission, only requesting that the aircraft used for the operations were labelled with Red Cross insignias. Background Colombian politician and then-senator Consuelo Gonz√°lez was kidnapped by the FARC on September 10, 2001. Her captors held her to pressure a possible \\"humanitarian exchange\\" between government-held guerrilla prisoners for FARC-held hostages. In 2002, former Vice Presidential candidate Clara Rojas was kidnapped along with presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, and were also held by the FARC. Mission Hugo Chavez with international guarantors of Operation Emmanuel. Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez said the plan consisted of three phases. The first phase comprised sending two Mil Mi-17 helicopters to Colombia carrying five International Red Cross Committee delegates. Both helicopters were to be equipped with medical aid appropriate for the humanitarian mission and in accordance with International Red Cross standards. Ch√°vez personally inspected the two helicopters in Santo Domingo before departing along with former president of Argentina N√©stor Kirchner, who was also invited to supervise the operations. Besides the two Mi-17 helicopters, two Bell 412 helicopters and three French-made executive jets were used for support tasks. Along with the ICRC delegates were representatives from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, France, and Switzerland. Hollywood director Oliver Stone was contacted by Ch√°vez to film a documentary about the ordeal. Family members of the three hostages travelled from Colombia to Caracas to wait for the end of the operation, set to conclude in Caracas with President Ch√°vez receiving the hostages, as previously petitioned by the FARC as a condition. =Phase I= Phase I During the first phase, two Russian-made MI-17 helicopters from the Venezuelan Military Search and Rescue Team flew into Colombia on December 27, 2007 at 1530 hours, with the permission of the President of Colombia and with the International Red Cross (IRC) insignia for a humanitarian mission. The helicopters flew more than two hours from the Venezuelan town of Santo Domingo in the State of T√°chira to the Colombian city of Villavicencio, capital of the Department of Meta, arriving at approximately 1730 hours. Colombia's High Commissioner for Peace, Luis Carlos Restrepo Ram√≠rez, was scheduled to receive the IRC delegates and the Vice Chancellor for Latin America and the Caribbean, , in Villavicencio to coordinate the rescue operation. At the end of the first phase Colombian President Alvaro Uribe said: ‚Äú[I'm] thinking about the freedom of Emmanuel, the child who was conceived by a kidnapped mother, who has been raised kidnapped, a condition worse than the conditions seen in enslaved societies [‚Ä¶]‚Äù =Phase II= On December 31, Hugo Ch√°vez read a letter from FARC wherein the group claimed that the hostage release had been delayed because of Colombian military operations. However, Colombian President √Ålvaro Uribe indicated that FARC had not freed the three hostages because Emmanuel appeared not be in their hands any longer. Colombian authorities added that a boy matching Emmanuel's description had been taken to a hospital in San Jos√© del Guaviare in June 2005. The child was in poor condition: one of his arms was injured, he had severe malnutrition, and he had diseases that are commonly suffered in the jungle. Having been evidently mistreated, the boy was later sent to a foster home in Bogot√°, and DNA tests were conducted to confirm his identity. On January 4, the results of a mitochondrial DNA test, comparing the child's DNA with that of his potential grandmother Clara de Rojas, were revealed by the Colombian government. It was reported that there was a very high probability that the boy was indeed a Rojas family member. A further analysis was carried out in a Santiago de Compostela institute in order to verify the results. El Tiempo: Ni√±o en poder de Gobierno s√≠ es el hijo de Clara Rojas; as√≠ se confirma tesis de Uribe de por qu√© las Farc no liberaron rehenes Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicol√°s Maduro questioned the results, stating that Colombia did not allow Venezuelan specialists to conduct their own tests and had created a \\"cloak of doubt\\". On January 4, the FARC released a communique in which they admitted that Emmanuel had been taken to Bogot√° and \\"left in the care of honest persons\\" for safety reasons, until a humanitarian exchange could take place. The group accused President Uribe of \\"kidnapping\\" the child in order to sabotage his liberation. Further medical tests revealed beyond any doubt the child's identity. The suspended Operation Emmanuel resumed and, on January 10, 2008, a humanitarian commission, headed by the International Committee of the Red Cross, flew in two Venezuelan helicopters to a location in Colombia that FARC had designated the previous day.

It was published by TSR, Inc. (TSR) in 1983 and is designed for 5‚Äì8 player characters of level 5‚Äì7. Plot summary The Duke of Rhoona begins issuing strange proclamations, such as decreeing that all taxes are to be paid in beer, horses are to be ridden backwards, and all dwarves are to be shaved and stretched to make them \\"presentable to human sensibilities\\". Duke Stephan is suffering from a curse which was brought upon him by Xanathon, chief cleric of the Ethengar Khanate immigrants living inside Rhoona's walls, and Stephen's own treacherous guard captain, Draco Stormsailer. The player characters must discover the nature of the Duke's affliction. They will need to lift the curse from the Duke of Rhoona, as he is needed to lead his troops against an invading army. To do this, they need to find the antidote for the curse. They must battle Xanathon, Draco, and their minions to achieve this goal. Lawrence Schick, in his sourcebook of roleplaying games, Heroic Worlds, describes the module as a town adventure in which the players are tasked with solving a mystery in order to remove a curse. The cursed town is threatened by a dwarven army, and the player characters must save the town. (preview) Publication history X3 Curse of Xanathon was written by Douglas Niles, with art by Tim Truman, and published by TSR in 1982 as a thirty-two page booklet with an outer folder. The module was designed as an adventure for 5th-7th level D&D; characters. It was developed by Douglas Niles and Alan Hammack, and edited by Deborah Campbell Ritchie.Niles, Douglas. Curse of Xanathon (TSR, 1983) Reception Doug Cowie gave the module a positive review in Imagine magazine. He called it a \\"welcome addition to the list of Expert Set modules\\", but nevertheless had some problems with it. The detective-style module requires the player characters to proceed in an orderly fashion through five scenarios. Cowie noted that \\"No party of players that I have known ever does what they are supposed to, in the right order, through five different adventures.\\" The players are railroaded by a non-player character who \\"pops up whenever the party is going astray\\" and three of the five adventures are initiated by an appearance of the ducal herald. In spite of this, Cowie thought that \\"this is a good module to play\\", and he specifically praised the way the town is presented. He finished his review by calling it \\"a module rich in character and invention\\", and \\"although it is unlikely that any party will follow through the story line [...] without a lot of guidance, if the DM can avoid making the players feel over- manipulated, there will be much enjoyment to be had.\\" The module received 7 out of 10 overall in a review by Jim Bambra in issue No. 48 of White Dwarf magazine. He called Curse of Xanathon a \\"detective adventure\\", though he said that it was \\"very much a programmed affair\\" and \\"players move through a series of distinct and logical stages, discovering clues as they go.\\" He noted that if the players fail to follow the clues, the Dungeon Master must direct them to the next encounter, which cuts down on the amount of freedom available to them. Bambra deemed the module to be not as good as the contemporaneous releases for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, but said it was superior to the two modules preceding it in the series, Isle of Dread and Castle Amber.

Elections in Norway are held on a Monday in September, usually the second or third Monday, as determined by the king. Early voting was possible between 10 August and 11 September 2009, while some municipalities also held open voting on 13 September. Voters elected 169 members for the Storting, each for a four-year term. Voter turn-out in the 2009 general elections was 76.4%. Candidates were elected on party lists in each of the 19 counties. The political parties nominated candidates for these lists during late 2008 and early 2009. The party lists had to be registered by 31 March 2009. Although the opposition received more votes, the governing Red-Green Coalition obtained more seats in parliament. This allowed Jens Stoltenberg to continue as prime minister. Further to the right, both the Conservative Party and Progress Party increased their number of seats in parliament. The centrist Liberal Party failed to meet the electoral threshold of 4.0%, and were reduced to two representatives in Parliament.  Pre-Campaign  = Proportional representation system = There are 169 seats in the Norwegian Parliament, but voters directly elect only 150 as constituency representatives, while the remaining 19 are \\"at-large\\" members‚Äîone for each county‚Äîand these are apportioned to parties based on the total national vote. For the purposes of parliamentary elections, Norway is divided into 19 constituencies corresponding to the counties, including the municipal authority of Oslo, which is a county of its own. The number of members to be returned from each constituency varies from 3 to 16, according to the population and area of the county. Norway has capped the number of \\"fixed\\" seats at 150 and, to determine how to apportion those amongst the 19 counties, it uses a two-tier formula based on population and geographic size. Each inhabitant counts one point, while each square kilometer counts 1.8 points. = Speculations = By early 2008, the Norwegian media were already speculating about possible outcomes of the election, and politicians were making statements about their preferred coalition partners. No single party has had a majority in the Norwegian parliament since 1961, and the largest party in the previous election won only 61 of the 169 seats. The overwhelming likelihood was therefore that the election would lead to the formation of a majority or minority coalition government; the Norwegian Labour Party was the only one likely to be able to form a single-party minority government. Liberal Party leader Lars Sponheim said during a televised debate in early 2008 that the ruling Red-Green coalition government would face the same problems as Kjell Magne Bondevik's second coalition government. He added that the Red-Green coalition was losing its \\"faith in the continued majority. It does something to you and your desire for power\\". In an opinion poll in December 2008, 55% of the Norwegian people had most faith in the Red-Green Coalition government to lead Norway out of the financial crisis.  Campaign  = Labour = thumb According to various opinion poll measurements, by late 2008 the Norwegian Labour Party was no longer the largest party in Norway. The Norstat poll for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) showed the Progress Party at 30.6%, while the Labour Party had declined to 26%. By September 2008 Labour had increased to 29.5%, while the Progress Party decreased to 29.2%. By early September, an opinion poll by Synovate put the Labour Party at 33.8%, while the Progress Party had continued to decrease to 21.4%. thumb After announcing their plans to tighten national immigration policy, the Labour Party gained a further 2.5% in an opinion poll done by In Fact for Verdens Gang, while the Progress Party decreased by 1.8%. Two out of three Norwegians claimed that they agreed with the new \\"tightening\\" of the immigration policy. Later, in a controversial statement, Labour Party secretary Raymond Johanson said \\"Siv Jensen is the biggest threat to the Norwegian oil industry\\", claiming that the Progress Party's oil drilling policy in Lofoten would be a mistake. Prime Minister and leader of the Labour Party Jens Stoltenberg stated that Labour would campaign for a renewed majority for the ruling Red-Green Coalition, consisting of Labour, the Socialist Left and the Centre Party. The consequences were less clear if the ruling coalition were to lose its majority--the coalition was unlikely to remain in power as a minority government. The Norwegian newspaper, Verdens Gang claimed in March 2008 that the Labour Party could form a minority government on its own if the ruling coalition should lose its parliamentary majority. The county mayor of S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag, Tore O. Sandvik, was quoted as supporting this option. During a debate, however, Stoltenberg said that a non- socialist majority would yield a non-socialist government. The Labour Party gathered 35.4% of the popular vote, which was an increase of 2.7% and resulted in three additional seats in parliament. This led to the continuation of the Red-Green Coalition government. After the election, many opposition leaders believed that the government would collapse because of the Labour Party constantly riding roughshod over their coalition partners. In an opinion poll in November, two months after the election, all parties continued to decrease, leading many to speculate that the coalition was \\"slipping\\". = Progress = thumb The Progress Party's One Hundred Days Plan was officially announced in August, 2009 in Trondheim. It said that the party wanted to increase \\"freedom of choice in all public services\\", making businesses \\"the most competitive in Europe and restoring confidence in Norway\\". Per Sandberg, deputy leader of the Progress Party's S√∏r Tr√∏ndelag chapter, blamed the One Hundred Days Plan and said; \\"The debate on our 100-day program laid out disappointingly fast. We can only lash ourselves to the all-time run\\". thumb Progress Party leader Siv Jensen stated that her party would not support a coalition government in which it did not participate, thus apparently ruling out a minority coalition of the Conservatives, the Liberals and the Christian Democrats, like the government of Kjell Magne Bondevik which was in office from 2001 to 2005. She also stated that the Progress Party would have been prepared to form a minority government alone if the party won more seats in parliament than the other three non- socialist parties. In the months before the election, the party had, as in the 2001 election, received very high poll results that steadily declined throughout the last weeks. In certain individual polls in late 2008, the party averaged around 30%, which at that point made it the most popular party in Norway, Hence the actual election result was relatively disappointing. During the election campaign in the four weeks before the election, the party dropped 3.5% in the poll. Most of these losses went to the Conservative Party, which had run a successful campaign. The Progress Party increased its share of the vote by 0.9%, a slight gain from the previous election and the best election result in the party's history. = Conservative = thumb In the previous election, the Conservatives had their worst result since the Second World War, only obtaining 14.1% of the vote. According to various opinion polls, most notably by Norstat, they had several weak showings from May to July 2009, in what Verdens Gang described as the \\"summer nightmare\\". After this, In Fact, an opinion poll service, announced that the Conservatives had scored 15% in their poll. thumb In January, Conservative Party deputy leader Per-Kristian Foss said that the party would not sit in a government without Erna Solberg as prime minister and claimed that both the Christian Democrats and the Liberals agreed with this policy. On hearing of this, Christian Democrat Party leader Dagfinn H√∏ybr√•ten, said that it would be natural to clarify this when the voters had had their say, but \\"the negotiations don't start now\\". After seeing the Progress Party's One Hundred Day Plan, Erna Solberg said \\"So I conclude that the 100-day revolution is canceled\\", with the two centre parties distancing themselves more from the Progress Party. Both the Christian Democrats and the Liberals openly supported a three-party coalition with Solberg as Prime Minister. A new Christian Democrat-Liberal-Conservative government would have avoided the need for support from the Progress Party, by leaving the draft budget from the Red-Green Coalition unchanged. This budget would then pass with support from the Red-Greens and the new non-socialist government. Further issues could then be postponed until 2010 and be handled individually. The Progress Party had promised to vote for measures with which they agree, and the Red-Green parties were expected to do the same. By the start of September, the Progress Party had lost 4.9% of its public support, and many believed that this was due to their One Hundred Day Plan. Meanwhile, the Conservative party gained 3.7%, many of whom were former Progress Party supporters. The Conservative Party obtained 17.2% of the vote (462,465 votes), an increase of 3.1%, earning 30 seats in parliament, 7 more than the previous election. After a \\"disastrous\\" election by the Liberal Party, its leader Lars Sponheim blamed Solberg for the bad results, accusing her of \\"tearing the party apart\\". Solberg responded with \\"He can't honestly believe that having political differences is to tear apart the Liberal Party\\". = Socialist Left = thumb Facing a steady decrease in support since they joined the Red-Green Coalition, the Socialist Left Party faced the prospect of one of their worst elections since the 1980s. In the 2007 local elections, their result was halved from that of the previous local elections held in 2003. By May 2009, the Socialist Left was the only party in the Red-Green Coalition whose public support increased--they averaged about 11.1% in an opinion poll. thumb Following a severe downturn, the party improved by late August, averaging around 10% in various opinion polls. At the same time, support for the two other members of the Red-Green Coalition decreased. According to the national newspaper Dagbladet, Socialist Left's rise in popularity was due to the stands they took on environmental issues, the most important of which was oil drilling in Lofoten. During the campaign, Socialist Left Party leader Kristin Halvorsen was the target of much criticism because, during the 2005 parliamentary election, she said \\"I will remove poverty with a stroke of a pen\\". Instead, poverty had increased nationwide during the coalition's four years in government. Jens Stoltenberg said \\"Kristin has been a driving force to combat poverty, especially among children. But we are not satisfied, and should do more\\". On 12 September the party suffered another decrease in public support, averaging 7% according to various polls. On the same day, two days before election day, party leader Halvorsen started the \\"24 hours - 24 measures\\" campaign to build up public support before the election. The Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten said in one of its articles that Socialist Left was involved in an \\"election massacre\\", saying there was little hope of increasing public support in the last two days. On election night, the party lost four seats and were left with eleven, but a three-seat gain by the Labor Party secured the Red-Green coalition a majority in Parliament. The shift of power within the coalition resulted in Socialist Left losing one cabinet minister, leaving them with four, the same as the Centre Party. They ceded the influential Department of Finance to the Labour Party in order to keep control of the Department for Education and Research. = Centre = thumb During the election, the Centre Party faced losing its core voters, the farmers, because Finance Minister Kristin Halvorsen wanted to introduce higher taxes on farming, which the farming community said would lead to high unemployment. Socialist Left MP Heikki Holm√•s said there was no proof of high taxation leading to more unemployment. In a later statement, Transport Minister Liv Signe Navarsete admitted that she had not \\"been able to reduce the income gap between farmers and other income groups\\", saying it would be an issue she would discuss with the Labour and Socialist Left parties. When the results were announced, the party received a 6.2% share (165,014 votes), a decline from 6.5%. This entitled them to as many Cabinet members as the Socialist Left, whose share of the vote had fallen from 8.8% to 6.2%. = Christian Democratic = thumb According to election analysts, the Christian Democratic Party was able to win more votes because of its strong opposition to the Marriage Act of 2008, which gave gay people the right to marry. They believed that same-sex marriage would damage children's upbringing, and party leader Dagfinn H√∏ybr√•ten claimed that marriage is primarily for a man and a woman. thumb During the national convention, H√∏ybr√•ten made a speech attacking the Red-Green Coalition. His most important message was an attack on the market economy and consumer thinking in Norway. In a later statement, H√∏ybr√•ten said \\"I challenge those on the Right who have conservative values, those who are not so concerned about dollars, cents and calculators\\". He later admitted it would be hard to work with the Conservatives if they won the election. A major problem facing the party was that it lost right-leaning Christian voters to the Progress Party. Many of these voters believed that the party would not be able to defend \\"Christian traditions\\" in Norway, because of its strong opposition to a government run by the Progress party. Another problem facing the party was that it was unable to refresh its image among voters. H√∏ybr√•ten stated that his party would not be part of a coalition with the Progress Party, but had not ruled out supporting such a government. The Christian Democrats' preference for a coalition was with the Liberals and the Conservatives. In total, the Christian Democrats were able to gather 5.5% of the vote, a decrease from the 6.7% achieved in the 2005 election. After the announcement of their results, Deputy Leader Inger Lise Hansen sparked unrest within the party. She felt that it had become too \\"narrow\\" and wanted it to return to the \\"generous and popular image\\" it enjoyed during the 1990s. Another faction within the party wanted H√∏ybr√•ten to resign as party leader. = Liberal = thumb The leader of the Liberal Party, Lars Sponheim, stated in September 2007 that his party would neither be a part of nor support a coalition that included the Progress Party, and that the Liberal Party preferred Labour Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg over Progress Party leader Siv Jensen. By late August, 2009 figures produced by Response suggested that only 2% within the Liberal Party wanted to collaborate with the Progress Party. Sponheim later distanced himself and his party from the Conservative Party because the Conservatives wanted to improve relations with the Progress Party, leading Sponheim to comment \\"A vote for the Conservatives is a vote for the Progress Party\\". He said that the Liberal Party was the only solid choice on the right that didn't want to be involved in a government with the Progress Party. thumb During a national broadcast debate on TV2, Sponheim said that, if the Progress Party won the minority government position, he would propose a motion of no confidence in the new cabinet. If that did not work, the Liberal Party would support a minority government led by Stoltenberg and the Labour Party. The Norwegian media criticised Sponheim for being very vague and unclear when it came to the Progress Party, and the Red-Green Coalition were unsure of what side he was actually on. In early September, election researcher Frank Aarebot predicted a catastrophic election for the Liberal Party. The main reason for his prediction was Sponheim's policy of merging various small municipalities into larger and more efficient ones. Centre Party leader Liv Signe Navarsete called this proposal undemocratic and said that forced mergers would only make matters worse. On the evening of 14 September 2009, Lars Sponheim announced that he would step down as party leader, as a consequence of the results his party achieved. The Liberal Party finished below the 4% threshold for leveling seats, leaving the party with only two seats in parliament, whereas they had ten seats before the election. Sponheim, who lost his own seat in Hordaland, later blamed the Conservative Party for the bad results that hit the Liberal Party and centre politics in Norway. Later still he revealed that he and Stoltenberg were planning to include the Liberal Party in the ruling coalition. Liberal Deputy Leader Ola Elvestuen was negative towards the idea, saying that the only option for a coalition was with the Christian Democrats and the Conservatives. = Red = thumb The Red Party was established by a merger of the Red Electoral Alliance and the Workers' Communist Party in 2007. Torstein Dahle, the leader of the Red Electoral Alliance, was elected party leader. In the 2007 county election, Red received 1.9% of the vote, increasing its share by 1.6%. In an opinion poll conducted by TNS Gallup for TV2 in late August 2009, the party received 2.7% of the popular vote, an increase of 0.7%. Such a result in the election would mean that the party would have two parliamentary representatives, one from Oslo and one from Hordaland. In total, 12 opinion polls claimed that Red would win two seats in parliament. On seeing these poll results, Dahle said he would support the Red-Green Coalition, acknowledging that he couldn't topple the closest thing to socialism to the right of Red. On 11 September, three days before election day, Jens Stoltenberg told the media that he didn't want the Red-Green Coalition to become dependent on Red in Parliament. Earlier, Ola Borten Moe from the Centre Party told Klassekampen that neither he nor his party would collaborate or affiliate themselves with Red. Red was accused of electoral fraud in late September, after a member had replaced Conservative Party tickets with Red tickets in the voting booths at B√∏nes Skole in Bergen. Trond R. Hole, a Conservative Party official, said he was \\"shocked\\", but assumed it was an individual and not the party that had committed the fraud. Dahle told the media that he, and the party, were strongly opposed to such a heinous crime. Later, the Conservative Party accused Red of another election fraud, this time in Oslo, but this time they had no proof to back up their claims. On election day, an opinion poll conducted by Dagens N√¶ringsliv predicted 1.9% of the vote for Red. It actually obtained 1.3% (36,219 votes), making it the largest party outside Parliament. 12,000 of those votes came from Oslo. In the municipality of Hordaland, Red garnered 2.5% of the vote, a decrease of 0.9% from the 2005 election. Red increased its voter share in Troms, in Nordland and in Telemark. Dahle acknowledged to the media that neither he nor his party were pleased by the results. He remained optimistic, however, calling the results a \\"good starting point\\".  Results  = Exit polls = Three exit polls, from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), TV2 and Verdens Gang, were released at 9 pm Norwegian time on the night of the election. Both NRK and TV2 predicted a slim majority for the ruling Red-Green Coalition over the opposition parties, while Verdens Gang showed a dead heat between the blocks, both having 84 seats in Parliament. Verdens Gangs poll showed the revolutionary socialist Red Party earning two parliamentary representatives, having already promised its support to the Red-Green Coalition before the election. Due to a manual error, the exit poll used by NRK significantly overestimated the support for the Socialist Left Party. = Election results = As in the 2005 elections, the Red-Green Coalition won the election with fewer votes (this time 47.9%) than the opposition parties (49.5%). Peter N. Myhre of the Progress Party complained that this meant eight years with a government that had not truly won an election, and called for an overhaul of an electoral system that, he claimed, disproportionately favours the Norwegian periphery. Hanne Marthe Narud, a political scientist at the University of Oslo, identified the result as a consequence of deliberate political planning, and in particular of a 2001 compromise in the Storting that balanced proportionality against an intent to over-represent rural areas. She explained to Dagbladet that this trend could be dated as far back as 1917, when it was argued that Oslo's status as the national capital inherently gave it greater influence, so that it should have less representation in parliament compared with rural areas. Electoral researcher Bernt Aardal stated that he had calculated the results of the election without the rural skewness. His results showed that the Labour Party and Progress Party would both lose a representative, while Red and the Liberal Party would each gain one, still giving a majority to the Red-Green Coalition. The table contains the official figures as of 25 September 2009, after all the votes had been counted. Voter turnout was 76.4%.

It remained in existence until July 1944. Plans to transfer Belgium from the military administration to a civilian administration were promoted by the SS, and Hitler had been ready to do so until Autumn 1942, when he put off the plans for the time being.Kroener, M√ºller & Umbreit (2003) Germany and the Second World War V/II, p. 26 The SS had suggested either Josef Terboven or Ernst Kaltenbrunner as the Reich Commissioner of the civilian administration.Kroener, M√ºller & Umbreit (2003) Germany and the Second World War V/II, p. 27 Reichskommissariat On 18 July 1944, the Military Administration was replaced by a civil one, led by the Gauleiter, Josef Groh√©, who was named the Reichskommissar of the Reichskommissariat of Belgium and Northern France (Reichskommissariat Belgien und Nordfrankreich)Kroener, M√ºller & Umbreit (2003) Germany and the Second World War V/II, p. 29 Role of collaborationist groups The Nazi administration was assisted by fascist Flemish, Walloon, and French collaborationists. In binational Belgian territory, the predominantly French region of Wallonia, the collaborationist Rexists provided aide to the Nazis while in Flemish-populated Flanders, the Flemish National Union supported the Nazis. In Northern France, Flemish separatist tendencies were stirred by the pro-Nazi Vlaamsch Verbond van Frankrijk led by priest Jean-Marie Gantois. The attachment of the departments Nord and Pas-de-Calais to the military administration in Brussels was initially made on military considerations, and was supposedly done in preparation for the planned invasion of Britain. Ultimately, the attachment was based on Hitler's intention to move the Reich's border westward, and was also used to maintain pressure on the Vichy regime - which protested the curtailment of its authority in what was still de jure national French territory - to ensure its good behavior.Kroener et al. (2000), p. 84 Command structure The Military Administration formed the core of a wider command structure which allowed the governance of occupied Belgium.

Before his major-league promotion, he spent three seasons with the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association. His best season in the major leagues came in 1921, when he hit .350. McHenry became ill during the 1922 season, experiencing unsteadiness and vision problems. He left the team to rest and he was later diagnosed with a brain tumor. Surgery was unsuccessful, and McHenry died at home in late 1922. Early life McHenry was born in Wrightsville, Adams County, Ohio. He made his professional debut with the Portsmouth Cobblers of the Ohio State League. McHenry, who had been a second baseman up to that point, was converted to an outfielder with Portsmouth. By October 1915, a column in the Portsmouth Daily Times said that McHenry had the potential to play in the major leagues. Beginning in 1916, he played with the minor-league Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association. Invited to spend spring training with the Cincinnati Reds before the 1918 season, McHenry sustained a broken nose when he was struck by a foul ball off the bat of Sherry Magee. The injury put McHenry in the hospital and sidelined him for a month. He was sent back to the Brewers. Major league career McHenry was called up to the major leagues with the St. Louis Cardinals during the 1918 season. He was one of the best players in the National League in 1921. His .350 batting average and .531 slugging percentage were both second-highest in the league behind his teammate Rogers Hornsby. His 201 hits, 102 runs batted in (RBI) and 92 runs scored were all career highs for him by large margins. Illness and death By June 1922, McHenry's play had declined noticeably, and he complained of visual problems. He began to have difficulty judging and catching fly balls in the outfield, and his batting statistics also suffered. Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey was concerned enough to send McHenry home to Ohio to rest and to consult with McHenry's father, who was a physician. About a month later, McHenry returned to the team briefly, but he was still in poor condition. Sent home again, McHenry sought medical care in Cincinnati, where doctors detected a brain tumor. McHenry underwent brain surgery, but his tumor could not be entirely removed. Writing to Rickey from the hospital, he used a baseball analogy to describe his tenuous health situation: \\"I'm afraid it is three and two on me in the bottom of the ninth. I must hit the next one out.\\" By early September, Rickey lamented the team's loss of McHenry, pointing out that McHenry had the team's third-highest RBI total even though he had played only 40 games while his teammates had played 120 games. On November 22, 1922, newspaper reports indicated that McHenry had been released from the hospital. His physicians had determined that there was no hope for McHenry's survival, and they thought he should spent his last days at home with family members. He died at his home in Ohio a few days later.

The resulting machine, designated the EC-1 weighed only 108 kg (238 lb) empty, and first flew in about 1960. Like the Pou-du-Ciel, the Pouplume dispensed with traditional ailerons and elevators, and pivoted the entire forward wing to provide pitch control. The EC-1 was followed by the EC-2, a two-seat version powered by a conventional aero-engine, and the EAC-3, the definitive version marketed for homebuilding, again powered by a motorcycle engine. By 1977, at least twelve examples of the EAC-3 had flown. A further development, the Pouplume Sport was designed to be powered by a 1500 cc Volkswagen air-cooled engine, and featured wings of reduced span.

It was Newport's first radio station. The studios are located on Main Street in Newport, and its on-air slogan is Country 1010 WCNL- AM. Translator History WCNL went on the air as a 250W daytimer on 1010 in 1960, before moving up the dial with 10,000 watts of daytime power on 1020 and changing call letters to WNTK. WNTK became a stand-alone AM station when the original WCNL AM 1010 and WCNL-FM 101.7 were sold off to individual owners. WCNL-FM 101.7 became the original frequency for country formatted WXXK (Kixx). WNTK was fairly successful as a stand-alone AM talk signal. WNTK would eventually add a couple FM simulcast partners, with the first FM simulcast being on 100.5 FM then known as WNBX in Lebanon under a lease arrangement. WNTK received another simulcast partner, this time under the same ownership when the talk programming was broadcast over WNTK-FM 99.7 in New London where the talk format remains today. WNTK was one of the early stations on board with The Rush Limbaugh Show, and was a huge catalyst in drawing listeners to the station. In fact, the station took advantage of Rush's popularity and even had a lifesize cardboard cutout of Rush which was brought to station live broadcasts. The owner, himself, was known to take Polaroid shots for listeners to keep while taking a picture with the Rush cutout. This cardboard cut of Rush was way before he 'slimmed down'. When Clear Channel bought WTSL in Hanover, New Hampshire, The Rush Limbaugh Show migrated to the much weaker 1400 signal, since The Rush Limbaugh Show's parent company was owned by Clear Channel. This was amid strong protests from the WNTK owner citing being an early and loyal affiliate, plus WNTK's strong 10,000 watt signal against WTSL's weaker 1,000 watt signal. WNTK would then move back down the dial to 1010, this time remaining with 10,000 watts during daylight hours, and begin to broadcast with low night power. (1010 was a former Canadian clear channel frequency) When WNTK, now WCNL, operated on 1020 AM, the station had to cease operations at sunset to protect the 50,000 watt former clear channel signal of KDKA in Pittsburgh which throws a very powerful nighttime signal over the northeastern United States and beyond. WCNL for a time carried an Americana format, before evolving in 2007 on the current country music format. In September 2007 then-WNTK switched back to the previous WCNL callsign. July 2010, WCNL became one of 5 radio stations in America to be nominated for the National Association Of Broadcasters \\"Small Market Radio Station Of The Year\\" Marconi Award. Other stations nominated were KFGO: Fargo, N.D.; KGMI: Bellingham, Washington; KOFM: Enid, Oklahoma and WFRE: Frederick, Maryland. WCNL has also been recognized locally as the \\"Radio Station Of The Year\\" in 2009, and \\"Radio Station Of The Year\\" Merit Award winner from the New Hampshire Association Of Broadcasters in 2009 and 2010 respectively. Current programming WCNL currently carries Boston Red Sox baseball along with sister stations WNTK, WCFR and WCVR. WCNL also is the weekly home of Newport High School football games. WCNL also airs the Newport Historical Society Minutes. In December 2007, WCNL created the \\"Stuff a Truck\\" campaign for Toys For Tots - which evolved from WVRR/WMXR's former Program Director Steve Smith's Toys For Tots campaign called Stuff A Bus - 2004-2006. In 2007, WCNL raised 178 toys for Toys For Tots. In 2008, 547 toys were raised. In 2009, 831 toys were raised. During the Fall of 2008, the Coats for the Community campaign kicked off with the United Way of Sullivan County. 342 coats were raised for needy families in Sullivan County. Coats For the Community continued in 2009, raising over 700 jackets for needy families.

Two competing applications had been tendered in the early sixties by La Fiesta Broadcasting and by \\"Mid Cities Broadcasting\\", then owner of KOYL AM/FM Odessa. The station signed on in 1967 as the area's first exclusively Spanish language station. KLFB was sold to a partnership of Drew Ballard and Marcelo Tafoya (owners of 92.1 Hutto Texas) in 1977. They filed for night authority, which was granted in 1979. The station operated from one site (Buddy Holly Park in north Lubbock) by day and a second site (82nd and Ash) in south Lubbock by night. Eventually, the partners agreed to an exchange where they'd take sole ownership of one station apiece. Ballard became sole owner of KLFB, and Tafoya became sole owner of KRGT Hutto. Ballard operated the station for many years, eventually LMAing the station to a local Catholic lay group. KLFB was purchased in September 2005 by Walker Broadcasting and Communications.

O'Neill and Elmer Gedeon were the only two Major League Baseball players killed during World War II.  Collegiate athletics  O'Neill distinguished himself as a very gifted college athlete. At Gettysburg College, the 6-foot-3, 205-pounder sometimes called \\"Porkie,\\" led the school's baseball, football and basketball teams to league championships. After graduation, he was the subject of a bidding war between two American League teams, eventually signing with his hometown Athletics.  Major league appearance  As the third-string catcher for the Athletics, O'Neill appeared in just one game, as a late-inning defensive replacement. In a lopsided road loss to the Detroit Tigers on July 23, 1939, O'Neill caught the bottom of the 8th inning, and did not have a plate appearance.  Military service and death in World War II  Following his time with the Athletics, O'Neill played in 16 games with the minor league Harrisburg Senators and also played semi-pro basketball and football. After the outbreak of World War II, O'Neill enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1942, and rose to the rank of first lieutenant with the Weapons Company, 25th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division. In January 1944, he took part in the amphibious assault on Kwajalein. On June 16, 1944, the second day of the Battle of Saipan, he was wounded in the shoulder by shrapnel, then treated for weeks back in the US. He returned to active duty in July, in time to participate in the Battle of Tinian. He was killed by a sniper at Iwo Jima on March 6, 1945. Among his surviving family was his young wife, Ethel McKay O'Neill.  Legacy  Of the 500-plus major league players who served in the military in World War II, O'Neill and Elmer Gedeon were the only players killed, both at age 27. The two have become symbols of \\"baseball's sacrifice\\" in the war effort. As the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum proclaims: \\"Ballplayers, like every other American citizen, understand the importance of giving one's self for their country.\\" In 1980, O'Neill was inducted into Gettysburg College's Hall of Athletic Honor for baseball, football and basketball.

Throughout a constantly evolving lineup of rock and fusion musicians from the Ottawa and Gatineau regions, keyboardist Guy LeBlanc (1960-2015) was widely regarded as the essence and constant of the band. Guy appears to be more widely known as the keyboardist for Progressive Rock Legends Camel since 2000. Recording and touring resulted in A Nod and a Wink and The Paris Collection (Live). They have released numerous concept-based CDs to critical acclaim, including Shadows Unbound, and the Heretik Trilogy. Furthermore, they have played several prestigious music festivals including NEARfest, and FMPM. History =Beginnings (1981 - 1984)= Nathan Mahl originally formed in Dec. 1981. The first version was formed when Guy LeBlanc, Donald Prince and Mark Sp√©nard, who had played together in the band Delerium, recruited Dan Lacasse. It is said that during one night in early 1982, while the band was on an excursion in the Gatineau National Park, the name took on its final form and the seed was planted. This first line-up went on to compose and record their first LP Parallel Eccentricities, in December 1982 releasing it in the Spring of 1983. It seems that 1983 was the busiest for Mahl, as they rehearsed full-time and gigged arguably almost as often. During that summer, they entered a band contest and performed in the finals of the Ottawa classic rock radio station Chez-106 (Sharechez '83), apparently blowing the roof off Barrymore's Music Hall. Some time in late 1983, Dan Lacasse left the group and was replaced by Wayne Palmer till Feb. 27, 1984. This was when Guy, for personal reasons, disbanded the group. =Interim (1986 - 1997)= In 1986, the band was shortly reformed as a trio (LeBlanc, Lacasse, Prince). Four new songs were written and recorded, but never released. Again in 1989, this time with second keyboardist Garth Boyd and without guitar, a seemingly more fusion Nathan Mahl ended the decade. Once again five new songs with this line-up were recorded but not released. The decade ended with Lacasse and Prince both leaving the group. The 90s began with a new rhythm section: Alain Paluck as drummer, Claude Prince on bass, joining LeBlanc and Boyd (the duelling keys). Many new songs were composed and rehearsed, but only rehearsals were ever recorded with this line-up. It was at this time that Guy decided to create the Mahl Dynasty improv project. This particular project seemed to have brought about the quiet demise of that line-up of Nathan Mahl. Still trying to revive the band, in 1994, Guy auditioned drummers and bassists. This was when Alain Bergeron and Luc Poulin joined. Shortly after that, guitarist Scott Daughtrey completed the quartet. This line-up recorded quite a bit of material, culminating in the disc Radio Rehab, which was not released because Guy was apparently not entirely pleased with the final product. Some of the songs from that disc have been released by others (PMS and the Progday Support disc 2005). In 1996, Daughtrey and Poulin left and were briefly replaced by what appears to have been a revolving door system of line-ups. The original Parallel Eccentricities was released on cd in 1997 (and included a comprehensive interactive cdrom supplement) by Mahl Productions, a label founded by Guy and his wife Dawn Mitchell. =Breakthrough (1998 - 1999)= Eventually, Donald Prince rejoined and suggested Jos√© Bergeron as guitarist. When Donald quit the group again, he was immediately replaced by brother Claude (again). This line-up became arguably the second most prolific Nathan Mahl. It was the suggestion of Jos√© Bergeron to record in a studio where he had bartered his talent as session guitarist in exchange for studio time, making it possible for the band to create the Clever use of Shadows in 1998. However, the strain of recording over eight months in a piecemeal fashion, and the necessity of Guy adding to the barter of session playing for the balance of the studio time, seems to have taken its toll on this line-up. In January 1999, Mahl Productions released Nathan Mahl's the Clever use of Shadows, and although this disc found a new audience for Mahl, Guy decided to remove the title from the catalogue in 2001, specifically due to what appears to be a long-standing disagreement with his co-producer for this disc. The month of May 1999 saw the band being invited to play at the first NEARfest, as a last minute replacement for the defunct Finneus Gauge] On June 28, 1999, Nathan Mahl took the stage at NEARfest, and many have suggested they blew the roof off the venue. One week later, they played their final gig at Ottawa U. Later in December 2003, NEARfest Records released the recording of Nathan Mahl's set at NEARfest 1999. =Heretik (2000 - 2002)= The 1990s ended with the return of Mark Sp√©nard (on guitars) to the fold. After a most interesting turn of events later in 1999 (including a solo disc for Guy and his joining Camel] in early 2000), the new Millennium saw the release of the band's next opus -Heretik: Volume I - Body of Accusations with a seemingly heavier sound. It might be suggested that it is musically a return to the proggier side of Mahl (with less fusion). However, the fact that Mahl had become more of a studio band may have to Alain Bergeron's decision to leave the group at the outset of Volume 1. This was followed in June 2001 with the second instalment of the trilogy. At this point Dan Lacasse accepted the invitation to return to the group. American author Michael McCormack (whom Guy had met while on his first tour with Camel) wanted to make Guy and Mahl the subject of his next novel, so he travelled to Ottawa and wrote of this experience while the band was recording Heretik: volume II - the Trial. This book is called \\"the People wish to be Deceived‚Ä¶\\". This time it was Claude Prince who left the group at the outset of Volume 2. The band continued its re-evolution with Heretik: Volume III - the Sentence, first by welcoming Guy \\"Geezer\\" Dagenais (whom Dan had met at a jam session) on bass. Volume 3 contains only one 54-minute song, and was released on May 3, 2002. Shortly after its release, Dagenais amicably left the group, since it was still only a studio project. =Unbound (2003 - 2006)= LeBlanc decided to take a few steps backwards and revisit the Shadows experience. This time however, he had the agreement of all the original members (including Don Prince on bass) to participate in this project. After all, this was a totally different line-up than the one recorded in 1999. In addition, half of the album features songs never before released. On February 20, 2003, Nathan Mahl released Shadows Unbound. The disc also features J.P. Ranger on lead vocals. Ranger is an old friend of Mahl, and had briefly joined the band in 1983, making it possible for them to tackle some of the juicier prog classic covers they did at the time. The rest of 2003 seemed to be a veritable trial by fire. LeBlanc had to quit Camel on the eve of their Farewell Tour because his partner had a series of heart attacks in April. Whilst caring for her, he produced his second solo disc. A little later in the year, the band was invited to produce the opening 25-minute song for a 9 band collaboration based on Homer's Odyssey. Guy composed the piece, and presented it to the band, and all were on board for the project. In 2004 production seemed pretty much on schedule; however, Don Prince contacted LeBlanc and quit the band due to other musical commitments, and is replaced by Luc Poulin for about 2 days. Since the original agreement for this project was that each band member create his own parts for the song (to be different this time), and that the deadline for submission to the label was getting very close, Guy LeBlanc borrowed a bass guitar, taught himself to play it, wrote the bass part and recorded it in 2 weeks time (thereby making the deadline). The Odyssey was released in September 2005 by Musea Records. 2005 seemed an exciting time for the band and their fans. LeBlanc showed a strong desire to perform again (and so did Lacasse and Sp√©nard). As a result possibly, Guy Dagenais returned to the fold. Also, LeBlanc sensed that this lineup could perform some of their possibly more difficult songs from their discography. He approached Alain Bergeron with the idea of having a second keyboardist/percussionist etc. on board (Alain appears to be quite the multi-instrumentalist). And so for most of 2005, Mahl was a quintet, and it was this quintet that performed in Lowell MA on September 9, and Prog-in-the-Park in Rochester NY on the 10th. In 2006, Nathan Mahl had settled on being a quartet (Alain Bergeron left seemingly to pursue a solo cd). The setlist now included more \\"older and newer\\" songs. Mahl performed in Ottawa for the first time since 1999, on May 20, and again at Progtoberfest on October 14. An official performance DVD Live & Unbound 2006 of the entire setlist is in the works. Yet as it often seems to happen with musical differences, both Marc Sp√©nard and Dan Lacasse left soon thereafter. =Exodus (2007 - Present)= In early 2007, with the prospect of playing the Montreal progressive rock festival FMPM,) Guy LeBlanc contacted Alain Bergeron to return on Drums. Guy Dagenais contacted Tristan Vaillancourt to join on guitar having see him play with his previous band, Widow's Walk. Tristan seems to have integrated well into the band's style, as well as adding renewed versatility and harder edge to its sound. The new lineup played FMPM on September 16 at FMPM, with a large portion of their set being new material. Aiming for release in the Summer of 2008, they are currently finishing their new CD, Exodus: Then. Guy LeBlanc has been in negotiations with Quebec label Unicorn Digital for its subsequent release. The concept is loosely based on the Exodus book in the Bible. They each made a conscious decision to record in his own respective home studio. Also in the works, is another possible DVD, with the documentary focus on behind the scenes at FMPM 2007 and at Exodus recording sessions. They plan on eventually making a follow-up Exodus: Now, taking the exodus concept to the present day. Whereas vocals were previously kept to a minimum, vocals are now used extensively to better convey the theme. Dagenais makes his Mahl vocal debut sharing much of the singing duties with LeBlanc. After a lengthy mixing process, Tristan left the band due to personal reasons. Exodus was finally released in December 2008 through Unicorn Digital. Just prior to this, David Campbell joins the band on guitar. This should prove to be an interesting choice as David is a seasoned Jazz guitarist, as well as the composer and leader in his own progressive rock band, The Rebel Wheel with whom Alain Bergeron was at one time their drummer. Also released in 2008 was Mahl‚Äôs contribution to the latest mega project by Colossus, based on Dante‚Äôs Inferno, and brought to you once again by the Finnish Progressive Rock Society and Musea records. Mahl are slatted to contribute a 7 minute piece, alongside 35 other current progressive rock bands. This is their 2nd time participating in such a project ‚Äìthe first time being The Odyssey in 2005. 2009 saw the return of Nathan Mahl to Progtoberfest, which was held on October 24 at Carleton University and also included Orco Muto featuring Maurizio Guarini keyboardist of the legendary Goblin. In early 2010, the band line-up changed and production of Justify stalled for over a year as Guy LeBlanc moved from Ottawa to Kemptville. Once established, he resumed work on Justify, contacting and recruiting Tristan Vaillancourt, David Campbell and original member Don Prince to play on it. He even recruited drummer Aaron Clark, but due to scheduling and technical problems, wound up playing the drums on the album himself. After returning to Europe in late 2013 for a short reunion tour with Camel, LeBlanc wrapped up the mix of Justify and was fortunate to have Andy Latimer contribute a guitar solo to the last song on the disc. Justify will be officially released on June 1, 2014. Core member Guy LeBlanc died of cancer on April 27, 2015. Discography =Parallel Eccentricities (1983)= In 1983, Nathan Mahl released their first LP - Parallel Eccentricities. The disc seems to have become a highly collectible classic in the Prog-Rock community of fans. The 1997 CD version of this disc was released with an interactive CD-ROM supplement history of Nathan Mahl and contains photos, audio and video archive footage from the original lineup. Songs: # Moral Values Part 1 # SlowBurn # Orgasmik Outburst Part 3 # Schizophrenia # No Vacancy =Mahl Dynasty - Borderline (1991)= In 1991, while no new Nathan Mahl discs were coming to fruition, Guy LeBlanc decided to record and release a series of improvisations performed by a duet of 2 drummers and himself. Since this was not a band effort, he also decided to call this the Mahl Dynasty (instead of Nathan Mahl). 15 improvisations lasting a total 71 minutes. Songs: # Spasmodik # the Promise # Traffic Jam # Window Shopping # Famous Quirks # Leave it to the Scots # Endangered Species # Downhill no Breaks # Quasimodo's day off # Just Stalling # Nessie's Driving Lesson # the Beach at Midnite # Orif the Glum # How can you explain this to people? # Bomb Shelter Blues =The Clever Use of Shadows (1998)= Nathan Mahl return after a long absence. This CD has been discontinued; nevertheless, most of the songs have been re-recorded on Shadows Unbound in 2003. Songs: # Without Words # Clever Use of Shadows # Orgasmik Outburst II # Machiavelique # Beyond the Rims of Despair # Something Like That # The Rubber Cage # Call To Arms =Heretik Volume I: Body of Accusations (2000)= Nathan Mahl returns a heavier sound. A man has been arrested and is being detained, awaiting a trial for crimes against society. Musically, this is a return to the proggier side of Mahl (less fusion). Songs: # When all was Well # Heretik part 1 # Heretik part 2 # Crimen Excepta # Heretik part 3 # Carpe Diem =Heretik Volume II: The Trial (2001)= The saga continues... the trial of the heathen heretic unfolds. The outcome of this miscarriage of justice is already known to the judges, but the accused is only now becoming aware of the fact that his fate was sealed even before his arrest. Musically, the plot unravels with dark and ominous themes. Emphasis is on the crushing pace and impending doom. Songs: # Entrance of the Judges # Malleus Maleficarum # De Praestigiis Daemonum # Heretik part IV # Ad Judicium # Moral Values part II =Heretik Volume III: The Sentence (2002)= The story comes to an end, apparently in a mean and nasty way. A single, mostly instrumental, 54 minute piece of music seals the protagonist's fate, and the judges have a field day. Possibly, an overwhelming intrusion on the senses... Song: # De Mortuis Nil Nisi Bonum (of the Dead, speak nothing but good) =Shadows Unbound (2003)= Nathan Mahl presents a set of compositions that continues their tradition of aggressive symphonic-rock music laced with complex jazz-rock stylings. And for the first time since 1983, the original lineup of Guy LeBlanc, Mark Sp√©nard, Dan Lacasse and Don Prince are joined by JP Ranger on Vocals. Songs: # Without Words # Between Here and There # Shadows Unbound # Funkface # Beyond the Rims of Despair # Scumsucking Parasites # Misleading Agenda # A Call to Arms =Live at NEARfest 1999 (2003)= Mahl's breakthrough set at NEARfest's inaugural 1st year. Songs: # Intro # Without Words # Clever Use of Shadows # Something Like That # Machiavelique # Orgazmic Outburst II # Orgazmic Outburst III # Carpe Diem # Call to Arms =Exodus (2008)= Nathan Mahl's concept album Exodus, loosely based on the book in the Bible. Songs: # Burning Bush # Let My People Go # The Plagues # The Parting # Down from the Mountain # 40 Years # The Last Climb # Canaan # Zipporah's Farewell # The Price of Freedom =Justify (2014)= For Nathan Mahl's Justify, bandleader Guy LeBlanc has recruited his most trusted and reliable collaborators to record seven new songs that explore Good and Evil, and the best way to tell the difference. Songs: #Tantrik Kobbler #Deception #It Tolls for Thee #Spirit #Ballad of an Angry Man #Justify #Infinite Light Additional tracks =ProgDay Kinections - The ProgDay Support CD (2005)= Previously unreleased track to this benefit CD. * The Place We Call Home =The Odyssey (2005)= 24 minute epic as part of a 9 band progressive rock ode to Homer's Odyssey, \\"The Greatest Tale\\". * Of Longings, Suitors, Deities and Quests... =Inferno (2008)= Gentle ballad as part of a 36 band progressive rock ode to Dante's Inferno. * the Comfort of Tears Book Published in 2001, the book The People wish to be Deceived..., is a 144-page book by American writer Michael McCormack subtitled Guy LeBlanc and The Making of Heretik Volume II The Trial. Much more than a behind-the- scenes look at the making of one album, the book is more generally about creating and recording progressive rock in the present climate and the philosophies underlying the Heretik trilogy.

The PTE was to have several basic office automation apps: word processing, database, etc. Just as NT was doing Beta testing of the PTE, PCs and PC networking took off, effectively killing the PTE before it completed Beta.

Characteristics  =Dimensions= Terrible was designed by Oliver Lang,Bernard Dumpleton, The Story of the Paddle Steamer (Intellect Books, 2003, . master shipwright at Woolwich Dockyard. Her length of 226 feet exceeded that of by 21 feet 6 inches. =Construction= Terrible was laid down at HMNB Devonport on 13 November 1843 under the name HMS Simoom. She was renamed on 23 December 1842, and launched on 6 February 1845. She was constructed of Honduras mahogany, East India teak and well seasoned English oak. She had one deck more than Retribution. With three masts and four funnels in two widely spaced pairs, she had a unique appearance among ships of this type. =Propulsion= The engines of Terrible were made by Maudslay and Co. wand were a similar pair as those on Retributution. They cost 41,250 GBP and each had 400 hp. The weight of the engines was 212 tons, the boilers 250 ton, the water in the boilers 138, the paddle wheels 44 and the coal boxes 16 tons, for a total of 560 tons. The coals boxes were to contain 800 tons of coal. Therefore a total of 1,360 tons was spent on the propulsion. =Armament= The heavy machinery still left some weight that could be spent on the armament. Plans were to mount 16 56-pounder 85 cwt guns and 4 10-inch granade guns. The 56 pounders would be mounted in a broadside arrangement between decks. Of the granade guns two would be mounted on pivots, and two as broadside guns on the weather deck. The boats would be armed with one brass 6-pounder, two 18-pounder carronades, and two 12-pounder carronades. Later the brass 6-pounder and two brass carronades were said to be saluting, or signal guns.  Career  =Service in the Channel and the Mediterranean= Terrible was commissioned on 5 December 1845 under the command of Captain William Ramsay and was first attached to the Channel Fleet. In 1847 she was sent to Portuguese Angola to transport the Portuguese exiles under the leadership of the Count of Bonfim back to Lisbon, as stipulated by the Convention of Gramido.The Times, 22 October 1847 (report of arrival in Lisbon).

Bonner-Smith and Captain A. C. Dewar, Navy Records Society, 1943, p. 209. Terrible then joined Admiral James Dundas's fleet in the Black Sea, where she served during the Crimean War. On 7 October 1854 she landed some of her 68-pounder guns at Balaclava to be used in the siege of Sevastopol.Russian War, 1854, Baltic and Black Sea, Official Correspondence, p. 332. At the naval bombardment of Sevastopol on 17 October Terrible was the northernmost ship of the Allied line and successfully bombarded Fort Constantine, the northern fortress protecting Sevastopol harbour.Russian War, 1854, Baltic and Black Sea, Official Correspondence, pp. 339-340, and map facing p. 344. =Further service= Terrible escorting the Floating Dock round Catherine's Point, Bermuda, 29 July 1869 On 14 January 1865, Terrible ran aground at Sheerness, Kent. In 1866, commanded by Captain John Commerell, she helped the to lay the fifth (and first successful) Atlantic cable. In 1869 she was one of three ships employed to move the specially built 'Bermuda' Dry Dock across the Atlantic from Madeira to Ireland Island, Bermuda. The dock was towed by and with Terrible lashed astern to act as a rudder, the voyage lasting 39 days.Bermuda's Royal Navy base at Ireland Island began in 1815 She was broken up in 1879.

It is composed of amir, an Arabic term meaning \\"commander\\", \\"governor\\", or \\"prince\\"; and sipahsalar, from the Persian for \\"army commander\\".Robert Bedrosian, \\"Amirspasalar\\", in: Joseph Reese Strayer (1983), Dictionary of the Middle Ages, p. 235. Scribner, . The amirspasalar was a wartime supreme commander-in-chief of the royal armies, and the bearer of the state flag. Under Queen Tamar (r. 1184-1213), it was the third great, after the atabek, office of the Georgian state. The Institution of the Royal Court, most probably codified during the second reign of George V (1314-1346) defines the office as \\"an honorary vizier and the head of army\\". The title of amirspasalar is first mentioned in the reign of George III of Georgia (1156-1184), but it was apparently introduced by George‚Äôs grandfather David IV (r. 1089-1125), who had substantially reformed Georgia‚Äôs military and civil administration. In the early 12th century the amirspasalar was chosen from the House of Orbeli, but in 1155, David, son of Demetrius I of Georgia, overthrow his father and attempted to curb the Orbeli influence by transferring the post to their rival, Tirkash Abuletisdze. After Demetrius‚Äôs restoration, the Orbeli again held the post down to their rebellion against George III in 1176/7, when it was given to Qubasar, of Kipchak origin. In 1184, Queen Tamar removed Qubasar and appointed a member of the Gamrekeli family. Later, the office passed to the family of Zachariads (Mkhargrdzeli), succeeded by the Jaqeli. The position was effectively abolished with the dismemberment of the Kingdom of Georgia later in the 15th century.

It describes how, in the United States, black and Hispanic students tend to be concentrated in schools where they make up almost the entire student body.The Shame of the Nation: Separate and Unequal by Nathan Glazer. The New York Times. September 25, 2005 Kozol visited nearly 60 public schools in preparation for writing the book. He found that conditions had grown worse for inner-city children in the 50 years since the Supreme Court in the landmark ruling of Brown v. Board of Education dismantled the previous policy of de jure segregated schools and their concept of \\"separate but equal\\". In many cities, wealthier white families continued to leave the city to settle in suburbs, with minorities comprising most of the families left in the public school system.Oprah's Books: The Shame of the Nation In the book Kozol quotes Gary Orfield of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, who says, \\"American public schools are now 12 years into the process of continuous resegregation. . . . During the 1990s, the proportion of black students in majority white schools has decreased . . . to a level lower than in any year since 1968.\\" In a separate quote from Gary Orfield in a letter to AllArtsAllKids.org, he mentions that, \\"the country clearly has had enough of the drill, kill, test & punish, and learn only two subjects style of NCLB reform...\\".http://www.allartsallkids.org/references/LetterToAAAKFromGO.pdf In his earlier books, like Amazing Grace, Kozol wrote that the schools of the South Bronx were stunningly segregated. But in the last five years, Kozol said that he \\"... realized how sweeping this change has been throughout the nation, and how reluctant the media is to speak of it.\\" Newspapers he says \\"... refuse to see what is in their own front yard ... in a description of a 98 percent black and Latino school, the newspaper won't say what would seem to be the most obvious starting point: This is a deeply segregated school. They won't use the word 'segregated.'\\"Apartheid America: Jonathan Kozol rails against a public school system that, 50 years after Brown v. Board of Education, is still deeply -- and shamefully -- segregated. book review by Sarah Karnasiewicz for salon.com In the book, Kozol attacks the disparity in expenditures on education between central cities and well-to-do suburbs, and the system of property taxes which most school systems and states rely on for funding. He expresses outrage at inequities in expenditure, pointing out that New York City in 2002-3 spent $11,627 on the education of each child, while in Nassau County, the town of Manhasset spent $22,311, and Great Neck $19,705. He found that there are comparable disparities in other metropolitan areas, since most funding is locally based. Kozol describes schools that are separated by a 15-minute drive but that offer vastly different educational opportunities. In one example, a primarily white school offers drama club and AP classes, and the nearby primarily black school requires classes like hairdressing.The Shame of the Nation Book review for wiretap.com by Elana Berkowitz, September 22, 2005 Chapter summaries =Chapter 1: Dishonoring the Dead= In the first chapter of this text, Kozol examines the current state of segregation within the urban school system. He begins with a discussion on the irony stated in the above quote: schools named after leaders of the integration struggle are some of the most segregated schools, such as the Thurgood Marshall Elementary School in Seattle, Washington (95% minority) or a school named after Rosa Parks in San Diego, California (80% minority). Kozol notes that most of the students within these schools are unfamiliar with the actions of the minority leaders their schools are named after. Kozol goes on to point out the lack of segregation within the urban communities that surround these schools, specifically mentioning the residential segregation on New York City, which matches levels from the 1960s. =Chapter 2: Hitting Them Hardest When They're Small= In chapter 2, Kozol describes the hardships students of color experience in segregated schools. Students of color have limited resources and support from the educational system. Students concerns were devalued and little consideration is given to help fund their schools. As opposed to affluent families they were able to provide an education for their children. Programs were available for those who could afford to pay children education. Baby Ivy is a private educational program that taught children of early age to receive the proper education they need. Children who had a head start in school had more positive educational outcomes than disadvantage children. =Chapter 3: The Ordering Regime= Kozol examines the strategy of \\"one size fits all\\" within urban public schools. Scripted programs such as 'Success for All' drive curriculum changes, using models adapted from industrial efficiency and Taylorism. In addition, Kozol discusses the naming ritual that permeates the formality of each course taught by the school. Such examples include 'Authentic Writing', 'Active Listening', 'Accountable Talk', and 'Zero Noise'. Teachers in urban school are strongly encouraged to follow these scripted lessons to bring formality and structure to the learning environment. This order is driven by state testing, which leads to anxiety among schoolchildren when their reading level is announced. Students are scored from Level One (lowest) to Level Four (highest), which places them into categories for further instruction. However, these placement scores are used as descriptive terms among students; 'He's a level one', or 'She's gone down to a level two'. =Chapter 4: Preparing Minds for Market= Within this chapter, Kozol continues to look at the curriculum shifts found in urban schools, which are nowhere to be seen in more affluent suburban schools. Increasingly, teachers are encouraged to weave 'work-related' themes into the lessons throughout the day. This trend starts at the elementary school level with 'Help Wanted' signs, classroom jobs labeled as 'managers', and students keep 'earnings- tracking' charts on their desks. Learning itself, is further taught as a 'possession' and not something one 'engages' with. The influence of managerial thinking continues into urban high schools, where students are strongly encouraged to select a 'career path' during their freshman year, so they may tailor their course work. Among the choices not marketed is a college education. The curriculum additions are often influenced by local corporations and business leaders. Kozol points out that many of these corporations place great importance on 'team players', and the walls of urban school classrooms are plastered with corporate brands and managerial themes. =Chapter 5: The Road to Rome= In this chapter, Kozol looks into the damaging effects of high-stakes tests, specifically on inner-city children who are almost destined to fail as a result of limited resources. In these schools, drastic and specific measures are taken to raise scores, usually at the expense of any freedom or flexibility in the curriculum. The schools adopt blanket teaching materials that have been compared to military manuals. Kozol also calls attention to the negative physiological effects these tests have on the children who take them. In L.A., standardized tests are given to children as young as 5 or 6, who without strong reading skills become frustrated to the point of crying and wetting their pants. Furthermore, the children who do not perform to standard are being forced to repeat multiple grades, which increase the likelihood that the student will drop out by 90%. The subjects that are not included in these high-stakes tests, such as geography, history, and science are no longer being taught, consequently lowering the quality of education for students in low performing schools. Music, art, and recess, and even portions of the summer break are also being excluded in order to maximize test preparation time. =Chapter 6: A Hardening of Lines= In this chapter, Kozol examines the increasing separation between the children of the privileged and the children of minorities. For years, the better school districts in New York have been more accessible to knowledgeable, \\"savvy\\" parents who know that applications to these schools must be filed a year early. These applications usually call for an understanding of a contract, and a written \\"educational philosophy,\\" two things that would be near impossible for an illiterate or non-English speaking parent to complete. The competition for the best, most acclaimed schools is cut throat and minority parents are usually unprepared or unaware of such competition. In conclusion to the chapter, Kozol describes a microcosmic example in the Roosevelt School District of New York. A proposal was made to dissolve the impoverished, mostly minority district and absorb the small number of students into the surrounding school district, East Meadow, with a mostly white student population. This proposal went through initially but was met with outrage by the East Meadow community and was eventually overturned. Kozol views this as a missed \\"opportunity to end the education apartheid of a small community of children\\". =Chapter 7: Excluding Beauty= In this chapter, Kozol reveals the poor conditions and state of disrepair many of the segregated schools are now in. The physical appearance of these schools negatively impacts the students desire to be in school and the way that they feel while they are present. Kozol talks about how there is no misery index in place even though there should be. In Oklahoma City, for example, the schools are overcrowded, lined with insufficient trailers that were not heated or cooled and often leak. In California, the overcrowding was so severe that students had to attend schools in monthly shifts year round. Some schools lack even the basic supplies such as textbooks, chairs, and desks for their students. Many students do not even attempt to eat lunch because the cafeteria is so over-crowded and the lines are so long. This lack of space and resources takes a toll on the variety and quality of courses that are offered. One student describes her desire to go to college and take AP classes, but without the teachers or space, she must instead take the courses already offered such as sewing and hair braiding. =Chapter 8: False Promises= In this chapter, Kozol describes his experience working as a teacher in New York during the implementation of Higher Horizons in the 1960s. This program was designed to increase spending per child in segregated schools while also training teachers to increase their expectations. The program claimed to improve reading and math skills, lower suspension rates, and improve relations with parents. As the program began to work, money was reduced, and this quick reduction resulted in the abandonment of Higher Horizons after 7 years. While briefly successful, the promises of the program fell through. The high expectations placed on new superintendents and personnel also bring false hope. The pressures of the cities they are placed in and the low achievement of the students make the turnover rate in these positions so high that it becomes impossible to achieve long-term goals. \\"The right of transfer\\" was a provision introduced in this chapter that gave off a false hope for children of poor people to attend well off schools that were available to middle-class communities. However, such schools were scarce and the requirements the students needed to meet to attend these schools were challenging and children who lived in the middle class communities had priority over any poor child attempting to attend their school. Kozol states that he doesn't believe a good school or a good school system can be built on miracles or on the stunning interventions of dramatically original charismatic men or women. =Chapter 9: Invitations to Resistance= Chapter 9 begins offering some answers to that question. Using the words of Jack White, a writer at Time magazine, Kozol begins by examining the need for a broad political movement. \\"Herewith‚Ä¶a radical proposal‚Ä¶Revive the civil rights movement, which went into limbo long before some of its most important goals were accomplished‚Ä¶\\" (Kozol, 2005, p. 216). This argument is more fully explored in the epilogue. Next, Kozol reports on the efforts of teachers and principals to resist the strengthening of segregation in public schools. In the second half of the chapter several examples of successful desegregation (ex. Prince Edward County, Virginia) are discussed. Kozol emphasized that while there are successes, they are fragile at best with many integration programs across the state being threatened. =Chapter 10: A National Horror Hidden in Plain View= In this chapter Kozol explores the United States legal system as an option for combating apartheid schooling. Local, state, and federal courts cases have attempted to bring desegregation and equality to public schools in many different parts of the country. Kozol explores both successful (ex. Brown vs. Board of Education) and unsuccessful ones (ex. San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez). Overall Kozol's analysis presents evidence (through several key cases) that the courts have been either unwilling or unable to correct the issue. The remainder of the chapter addresses the legislative branch's attempts to correct the problem. Kozol discusses both Congressman Fattah's bill and Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr.'s proposal for a constitutional amendment. Neither effort has been met with much success. =Chapter 11: Deadly Lies= From the legislative branch Kozol moves to the executive. By reviewing the impact of No Child Left Behind and high- stakes achievement tests this chapter further demonstrates the increasing imbalance in quality of public schools. The basic argument presented in the book is that no matter how much students are told they can succeed and how much educators teach to the test, schools that have inadequate funding will inevitably suffer. According to Kozol the largely Republican controlled presidency of the last 28 years has further segregated American schools through a failed education policy. The rest of the chapter focuses on \\"standard-based reform\\" and the small school initiative (see Deborah Meier, The power of their ideas: Lessons for America from a small school in Harlem) in relation to school segregation. Kozol argues that the \\"standards-based reform\\" is an effort to address the scoring gap between high and low socio- economic schools through the use of positive thinking and sheer willpower. This strategy is shown to be occasionally successful in the extreme short term, but ultimately unsuccessful in the long run. In other words, scores would often improve for the particular test being studied for, but the competency of the students did not improve. As for the small school initiative, Kozol is generally supportive of the idea but is critical when it amounts to many smaller just as segregated learning institutions around the nation. =Chapter 12: Treasured Places= Kozol's last chapter is devoted to showcase examples of excellence that he witnessed in his visits to schools in America's most segregated schools. Examples such as Mr. Bedrock (an elementary teacher in one of New York's most segregated schools) and Miss Rosa (the principal of the same school, PS. 30) demonstrate that even in the worst of situations there is still hope.

Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein- mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.

In 1995, they were signed to Scratchie Records whose releases came to be distributed by Mercury Records beginning in 1996. Biography The band evolved from two previous incarnations, the first being The Un-Ones with Senji, Drapey, and drummer Malcom Vaughn, hailing from Hampton, VA and formed in 1986. The Un-Ones was followed by the band Rhithm Lyd, formed in 1990 with Senji, Katie Power on Bass, and Phil Searcy on drums. In the summer of 1990, Senji moved to Richmond, VA to attend Virginia Commonwealth University. During breaks, he would return to Hampton where Rhithm Lyd continued with Katie and Phil. Drapey moved back to Hampton after a temporary move to Italy, and replaced Katie as bass player in 1991. Drapey joined Senji in Richmond soon after, and Rhithm Lyd became Fulflej in 1992 with the addition of drummer Spock Jenkins, the Cinnamon Lover. In late 1997, Spock left Earth and was replaced with drummer Ron O'Dell. Their musical style blends early 1990s alternative rock, math rock, punk, heavy metal, dream pop, and shoegaze. Soon after being discovered in Richmond by D'arcy Wetsky of the Smashing Pumpkins, they were signed to James Iha (also of the Pumpkins) and D'arcy's newly formed independent record label, Scratchie Records, in 1995. Fulflej's Scratchie releases include the 7-inch \\"Work In This Universe\\" b/w \\"Parallel To Gravity\\", the EP \\"The Microwave EP\\", and the LP \\"Wack-Ass Tuba Riff\\". Mercury Records, who were to distribute the soundtrack for the Power Rangers movie sequel, Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie, invited Fulflej to write and record the theme song for the movie. The result was the track \\"Shift Into Turbo\\" which was featured in the movie and on the soundtrack, both released in 1997. The members of Fulflej were also featured performing the song in the TV trailers for the film. In 1999, Fulflej recorded an additional Scratchie LP, \\"To Keep A Long Story Long...\\", though it was never released other than by the band members themselves over the internet after Fulflej had disbanded in 2000.
